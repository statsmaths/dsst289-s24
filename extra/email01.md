[DSST289: Intro Data Science] Course Links and Information

Dear DSST289 Students â€”

I am looking forward to meeting you all in class next week. We will have a longer discussion about the course details on Monday morning, but I thought it might be useful to share a few items ahead of time.

First, please try to bring a computer to class on Monday. We will be setting up the course materials together and it will be easier if you can follow along on your own machine. If for any reason you will not have access to a laptop that you can bring to class this semester, please let me know and we will work together to find a solution.

Secondly, all of the course material for this semester will be posted on our class website, which can be accessed at the following link:

    https://statsmaths.github.io/dsst289-s24/

There is nothing you need to do on the site before our first meeting; I am sharing it just in case it is helpful to have the schedule and syllabus ahead of time.

Finally, if there are any pressing questions or special circumstances that I should be aware of, please feel free to send them along by email. I will also be available in my office on Monday afternoon if you have any personal concerns that you would like to discuss in person.

Otherwise, I hope you are able to enjoy the weekend ahead and will see you all in class next week!

Best,
Prof. Arnold
