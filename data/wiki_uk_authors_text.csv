Marie de France,Marie de France was a poet possibly born in what is now France who lived in England during the late 12th century. She lived and wrote at an unknown court but she and her work were almost certainly known at the royal court of King Henry II of England. Virtually nothing is known of her life; both her given name and its geographical specification come from her manuscripts. However one written description of her work and popularity from her own era still exists. She is considered by scholars to be the first woman known to write francophone verse. Marie de France wrote in Francien with some Anglo-Norman influence. She was proficient in Latin as were most authors and scholars of that era as well as Middle English and possibly Breton. She is the author of the Lais of Marie de France. She translated Aesops Fables from Middle English into Anglo-Norman French and wrote Espurgatoire seint Partiz Legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick based upon a Latin text. Recently she has been identified as the author of a saints life The Life of Saint Audrey. Her Lais were and still are widely read and influenced the subsequent development of the romanceheroic literature genre. The actual name of the author now known as Marie de France is unknown; she has acquired this nom de plume from a line in one of her published works Marie ai num si sui de France which translates as My name is Marie and I am from France. Some of the most commonly proposed suggestions for the identity of this 12th-century poet are Marie of France Countess of Champagne; Marie Abbess of Shaftesbury and half-sister to Henry II King of England; Marie Abbess of Reading; Marie I of Boulogne; Marie Abbess of Barking; and Marie de Meulan wife of Hugh Talbot and daughter of Waleran de Meulan. Based on evidence from her writings it is clear that despite being born in France she spent much of her life living in England. Four works or collections of works have been attributed to Marie de France. She is principally known for her authorship of The Lais of Marie de France a collection of twelve narrative poems mostly of a few hundred lines each. She claims in the preambles to most of these Breton lais that she has heard the stories they contain from Breton minstrels and it is in the opening lines of the poem Guigemar that she first reveals her name to be Marie. There are 102 Ysopet fables that have also been attributed to her besides a retelling of the Legend of the Purgatory of St. Patrick and recently a saints life called La Vie seinte Audree about Saint Audrey of Ely although this last attribution is not accepted by all critics. Scholars have dated Maries works to between about 1160 and 1215 the earliest and latest possible dates respectively. It is probable that the Lais were written in the late 12th century; they are dedicated to a noble king usually assumed to be Henry II of England or possibly his eldest son Henry the Young King. Another of her works the Fables is dedicated to a Count William who may have been either William of Mandeville or William Marshall. However it has also been suggested that Count William may refer to William Longsword. Longsword was a recognized illegitimate son of Henry II. If Marie was actually Henry IIs half-sister a dedication to his son might be understandable. It is likely that Marie de France was known at the court of King Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. A contemporary of Marie the English poet Denis Piramus mentions in his Life of Saint Edmund the King written in around 1180 the lais of a Marie which were popular in aristocratic circles. It is clear from her writing that Marie de France was highly educated and multilingual; this level of education was not available to the common or poor at this time so we can infer that Marie de France was of noble birth as other noble women such as Heloise and Christine de Pizan were also educated and wrote. In addition to secular wealthy women a number of religious women of this period also used their education and pursued writing . She was first called Marie de France by the French scholar Claude Fauchet in 1581 in his Recueil de lorigine de la langue et poesie françoise and this name has been used ever since. She wrote in Francien a dialect localized around Paris and Île-de-France but there is presence of an Anglo-Norman dialect in her writings. Hence scholars generally deduce she lived in the parts of Île-de-France close to Normandy or alternatively in an area in-between such as Brittany or Vexin. But Anglo-Norman influence may be due to her living in England during her adult life which is also suggested by the fact that so many of her texts were found in England. The signification of the phrase si sui de France however is ambiguous and equivocal. Marie might possibly not have stated that she was from France if she was originally from a region governed by Henry II such as Brittany Normandy Anjou or Aquitaine unless she had been thoroughly anglicized. Three of the five surviving manuscript copies of the Lais are written in continental French whilst British Library MS Harley 978 written in Anglo-Norman French in the mid-13th century may reflect the dialect of the copyist. Breton lais were certainly in existence before Marie de France chose to recast the themes that she heard from Breton minstrels into poetic narratives in Anglo-Norman verse but she may have been the first to present a new genre of the lai in narrative form. Her lays are a collection of 12 short narrative poems written in eight-syllable verse that were based on Breton or Celtic legends which were part of the oral literature of the Bretons. The lais of Marie de France had a huge impact on the literary world. They were considered a new type of literary technique derived from classical rhetoric and imbued with such detail that they became a new form of art. Marie may have filled her detailed poems with imagery so that her audience would easily remember them. Her lais range in length from 118 to 1184 lines frequently describe courtly love entangled in love triangles involving loss and adventure and often take up aspects of the merveilleux and at times intrusions from the fairy world. One may have a better sense of Marie de France from her very first lay or rather the Prologue she uses to prepare her readers for what is to come. The first line dictates Whoever has received knowledge and eloquence in speech from God should not be silent or secretive but demonstrate it willingly Marie de France in so many words credits her literary skills to God and is therefore allowed to write the lays without her patrons permission . She wants people to read what she has produced along with her ideas and as such urges readers to search between the lines for her writing will be subtle. In this Prologue alone Marie de France has deviated from common poets of her time by adding subtle delicate and weighted writing to her repertoire. Marie de France took her opportunity as a writer to make her words be heard and she took them during a time where the production of books and codexes was a long arduous and expensive process where just copying the Bible took fifteen months until the texts completion. Unlike the heroes of medieval romances the characters in Maries stories do not seek out adventure. Instead adventures happen to them. While the settings are true to life the lais often contain elements of folklore or of the supernatural such as Bisclavret. While the setting is described in realistic detail the subject is a werewolf sympathetically portrayed. Marie moves back and forth between the real and the supernatural skillfully expressing delicate shades of emotion. Lanval features a fairy woman who pursues the titular character and eventually brings her new lover to Avalon with her at the end of the lai. The setting for Maries lais is the Celtic world embracing England Wales Ireland Brittany and Normandy. Only five manuscripts containing some or all of Maries lais exist now and the only one to include the general prologue and all twelve lais is British Library MS Harley 978. That may be contrasted with the 25 manuscripts with Maries Fables and perhaps reflects their relative popularity in the late Middle Ages. In these Fables she reveals a generally aristocratic point of view with a concern for justice a sense of outrage against the mistreatment of the poor and a respect for the social hierarchy. Nevertheless Maries lais have received much more critical attention in recent times. Along with her lais Marie de France also published a large collection of fables. Many of the fables she wrote were translations of Aesops fables into English and others can be traced to more regional sources fables to which Marie would have been exposed at a young age. Among her 102 fables there are no concrete guidelines for morality; and men women and animals receive varying treatments and punishments. Marie de France introduces her fables in the form of a prologue where she explains the importance of moral instruction in society. In the first section of the prologue she discusses the medieval ideal of clergie. Clergie is the notion that people have a duty to understand learn and preserve works of the past for future peoples. Here in the prologue she is referencing the duty of scholars to preserve moral philosophy and proverbs. The rest of Marie de Frances prologue outlines how Aesop took up this duty for his society and how she must now preserve his fables and others for her present culture. Structurally each of the fables begins with the recounting of a tale and at the end Marie de France includes a short moral. Some of these morals like those translated from Aesops fables are expected and socially congruous. For instance the fable of The Wolf and the Lamb also known as Fable 2 in Maries collection follows a well-known and established storyline. Just as in Aesops original fable Marie de Frances translation describes a lamb and a wolf drinking from the same stream the wolf unjustly condemning the lamb to death for drinking inoffensively downstream from him. Marie de France repeats the established moral at the end But these are things rich nobles dodestroy folk with false evidence. However in the new fables featuring human female characters Marie de France asserts female power and cunning disparaging men who are ignorant or behave foolishly. One character a peasant woman makes multiple appearances in the fables and is praised for her shrewd and sly ways. Fables 44 The Woman Who Tricked Her Husband and 45 A Second Time a Woman Tricks Her Husband both recount tales of the same peasant woman successfully carrying out an affair despite her husband having caught her with her lover both times. In the first fable the peasant woman convinces her husband that her lover was merely a trick of the eye and in the second persuades her husband that he has had a vision of her and a man foreshadowing her death. Marie lauds the woman for her crafty ways and faults the peasant husband with idiocy. The morality or lack thereof in these two female-centered fables is interesting and takes root in the tradition of wife tricking her husband stories such as The Merchants Tale and Scots-Irish tradition. Fable 51 Del cok e del gupil is considered an early version of the Reynard the Fox tales and was an inspiration for Geoffrey Chaucers Nuns Priests Tale. According to the epilogue of the Fables they are translated from an English version by Alfred the Great. In most of Marie de Frances Lais love is associated with suffering and over half of them involve an adulterous relationship. In Bisclavret and Equitan the adulterous lovers are severely condemned but there is evidence that Marie approved of extramarital affairs under certain circumstances When the deceived partner has been cruel and merits deception and when the lovers are loyal to one another. In Maries Lais love always involves suffering and frequently ends in grief even when the love itself is approved. Maries lovers are usually isolated and relatively unconcerned with anything outside the immediate cause of their distress whether a jealous husband or an envious society. However the means of overcoming this suffering is beautifully and subtly illustrated. Marie concentrates on the individuality of her characters and is not very concerned with their integration into society. If society does not appreciate the lovers then the lovers die or abandon society and society is the poorer for it. Marie de Frances lais not only portray a gloomy outlook on love but also defied the traditions of love within the Church at the time. She wrote about adulterous affairs women of high stature who seduce other men and women seeking escape from a loveless marriage often to an older man which gave the idea that women can have sexual freedom. She wrote lais many of which seemed to endorse sentiments that were contrary to the traditions of the Church especially the idea of virginal love and marriage. The lais also exhibit the idea of a stronger female role and power. In this she may have inherited ideas and norms from the troubadour love songs that were common at the Angevin courts of England Aquitaine Anjou and Brittany; songs in which the heroine is a contradictory symbol of power and inarticulacy; she is at once acutely vulnerable and emotionally overwhelming irrelevant and central. Maries heroines are often the instigators of events but events that often end in suffering. The heroines in Maries Lais are often imprisoned. This imprisonment may take the form of actual incarceration by elderly husbands as in Yonec and in Guigemar where the lady who becomes Guigemars lover is kept behind the walls of a castle which faces the sea or merely of close surveillance as in Laustic where the husband who keeps a close watch on his wife when he is present has her watched equally closely when he is away from home. Perhaps it reflects some experience within her own life. The willingness to endorse such thoughts as adultery in the 12th century is perhaps remarkable. It certainly reminds us that people in the Middle Ages were aware of social injustices and did not just accept oppressive conditions as inevitable by the will of God. In addition to her defying the construct of love exhibited by the contemporary Church Marie also influenced a genre that continued to be popular for another 300 years the medieval romance. By the time Marie was writing her lais France already had a deep-rooted tradition of the love-lyric specifically in Provence. Maries Lais represent in many ways a transitional genre between Provençal love lyrics from an earlier time and the romance tradition that developed these themes. Her stories exhibit a form of lyrical poetry that influenced the way that narrative poetry was subsequently composed adding another dimension to the narration through her prologues and the epilogues for example. She also developed three parts to a narrative lai aventure ; lai ; conte . Additionally Marie de France brought to the fore a new genre known as chivalric literature. In the late 14th century at broadly the same time that Geoffrey Chaucer included The Franklins Tale itself a Breton lai in his Canterbury Tales a poet named Thomas Chestre composed a Middle English romance based directly upon Marie de Frances Lanval which perhaps predictably spanned much more now than a few weeks of the heros life a knight named Sir Launfal. In 1816 the English poet Matilda Betham wrote a long poem about Marie de France in octosyllabic couplets The Lay of Marie. Lauren Groffs 2021 novel Matrix is about the seventeen-year-old Marie de France... sent to England to be the new prioress of an impoverished abbey its nuns on the brink of starvation and beset by disease.
Geoffrey Chaucer,Geoffrey Chaucer was an English poet author and civil servant best known for The Canterbury Tales. He has been called the father of English literature or alternatively the father of English poetry. He was the first writer to be buried in what has since come to be called Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey. Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and astronomer composing the scientific A Treatise on the Astrolabe for his 10-year-old son Lewis. He maintained a career in the civil service as a bureaucrat courtier diplomat and member of parliament. Among Chaucers many other works are The Book of the Duchess The House of Fame The Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde. He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of Middle English when the dominant literary languages in England were still Anglo-Norman French and Latin. Chaucers contemporary Thomas Hoccleve hailed him as . Almost two thousand English words are first attested to in Chaucerian manuscripts. Chaucer was born in London most likely in the early 1340s though the precise date and location remain unknown. The Chaucer family offers an extraordinary example of upward mobility. His great-grandfather was a tavern keeper his grandfather worked as a purveyor of wines and his father John Chaucer rose to become an important wine merchant with a royal appointment. Several previous generations of Geoffrey Chaucers family had been vintners and merchants in Ipswich. His family name is derived from the French chaucier once thought to mean shoemaker but now known to mean a maker of hose or leggings. In 1324 his father John Chaucer was kidnapped by an aunt in the hope of marrying the 12-year-old to her daughter in an attempt to keep the property in Ipswich. The aunt was imprisoned and fined 250 now equivalent to about 200000 which suggests that the family was financially secure. John Chaucer married Agnes Copton who inherited properties in 1349 including 24 shops in London from her uncle Hamo de Copton who is described in a will dated 3April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as moneyer said to be a moneyer at the Tower of London. In the City Hustings Roll 110 5 Ric II dated June 1380 Chaucer refers to himself as me Galfridum Chaucer filium Johannis Chaucer Vinetarii Londonie which translates as I Geoffrey Chaucer son of the vintner John Chaucer London. While records concerning the lives of his contemporaries William Langland and the Gawain Poet are practically non-existent since Chaucer was a public servant his official life is very well documented with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career. The first of the Chaucer Life Records appears in 1357 in the household accounts of Elizabeth de Burgh the Countess of Ulster when he became the noblewomans page through his fathers connections a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. The countess was married to Lionel of Antwerp 1st Duke of Clarence the second surviving son of the king Edward III and the position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He also worked as a courtier a diplomat and a civil servant as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the Kings Works. In 1359 the early stages of the Hundred Years War Edward III invaded France and Chaucer travelled with Lionel of Antwerp Elizabeths husband as part of the English army. In 1360 he was captured during the siege of Rheims. Edward paid 16 for his ransom a considerable sum equivalent to 12261 in 2021 and Chaucer was released. After this Chaucers life is uncertain but he seems to have travelled in France Spain and Flanders possibly as a messenger and perhaps even going on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Around 1366 Chaucer married Philippa Roet. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward IIIs queen Philippa of Hainault and a sister of Katherine Swynford who later became the third wife of John of Gaunt. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had but three or four are most commonly cited. His son Thomas Chaucer had an illustrious career as chief butler to four kings envoy to France and Speaker of the House of Commons. Thomass daughter Alice married the Duke of Suffolk. Thomass great-grandson John de la Pole Earl of Lincoln was the heir to the throne designated by Richard III before he was deposed. Geoffreys other children probably included Elizabeth Chaucy a nun at Barking Abbey Agnes an attendant at Henry IVs coronation; and another son Lewis Chaucer. Chaucers Treatise on the Astrolabe was written for Lewis. According to tradition Chaucer studied law in the Inner Temple at this time. He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a valet de chambre yeoman or esquire on 20June 1367 a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368 he may have attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti daughter of Galeazzo II Visconti in Milan. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance Jean Froissart and Petrarch. Around this time Chaucer is believed to have written The Book of the Duchess in honour of Blanche of Lancaster the late wife of John of Gaunt who died in 1369 of the plague. Chaucer travelled to Picardy the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited Genoa and Florence. Numerous scholars such as Skeat Boitani and Rowland suggested that on this Italian trip he came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio. They introduced him to medieval Italian poetry the forms and stories of which he would use later. The purposes of a voyage in 1377 are mysterious as details within the historical record conflict. Later documents suggest it was a mission along with Jean Froissart to arrange a marriage between the future King Richard II and a French princess thereby ending the Hundred Years War. If this was the purpose of their trip they seem to have been unsuccessful as no wedding occurred. In 1378 Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy to the Visconti and to Sir John Hawkwood English condottiere in Milan. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the Canterbury Tales for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere. A possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when Edward III granted Chaucer a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant but given on a day of celebration St Georges Day 1374 when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded it is assumed to have been for another early poetic work. It is not known which if any of Chaucers extant works prompted the reward but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later poets laureate. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18April 1378. Chaucer obtained the very substantial job of comptroller of the customs for the port of London which he began on 8June 1374. He must have been suited for the role as he continued in it for twelve years a long time in such a post at that time. His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years but it is believed that he wrote most of his famous works during this period. Chaucers only surviving handwriting dates from this period. This is a request for temporary leave from work presented to King Richard II hitherto believed to be the work of one of his subordinates due to the low level of language. On 16 October 1379 Thomas Staundon filed a legal action against his former servant Cecily Chaumpaigne and Chaucer accusing Chaucer of unlawfully employing Chaumpaigne before her term of service was completed which violated the Statute of Labourers. Though eight court documents dated between October 1379 and July 1380 survive from the action the case was never prosecuted and no details survive about Chaumpaignes service or how she came to leave Staundons employ for Chaucers. It is not known if Chaucer was in the City of London at the time of the Peasants Revolt but if he was he would have seen its leaders pass almost directly under his apartment window at Aldgate. While still working as comptroller Chaucer appears to have moved to Kent being appointed as one of the commissioners of peace for Kent at a time when French invasion was a possibility. He is thought to have started work on The Canterbury Tales in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament for Kent in 1386 and attended the Wonderful Parliament that year. He appears to have been present at most of the 71 days it sat for which he was paid 24 9s. On 15October that year he gave a deposition in the case of Scrope v. Grosvenor. There is no further reference after this date to Philippa Chaucers wife and she is presumed to have died in 1387. He survived the political upheavals caused by the Lords Appellants despite the fact that Chaucer knew some of the men executed over the affair quite well. On 12 July 1389 Chaucer was appointed the clerk of the kings works a sort of foreman organising most of the kings building projects. No major works were begun during his tenure but he did conduct repairs on Westminster Palace St. Georges Chapel Windsor continued building the wharf at the Tower of London and built the stands for a tournament held in 1390. It may have been a difficult job but it paid two shillings a day more than three times his salary as a comptroller. Chaucer was also appointed keeper of the lodge at the Kings park in Feckenham Forest in Worcestershire which was a largely honorary appointment. In September 1390 records say that Chaucer was robbed and possibly injured while conducting the business and he stopped working in this capacity on 17June 1391. He began as Deputy Forester in the royal forest of Petherton Park in North Petherton Somerset on 22June. This was no sinecure with maintenance an important part of the job although there were many opportunities to derive profit. Richard II granted him an annual pension of 20 pounds in 1394 and Chaucers name fades from the historical record not long after Richards overthrow in 1399. The last few records of his life show his pension renewed by the new king and his taking a lease on a residence within the close of Westminster Abbey on 24December 1399. Henry IV renewed the grants assigned by Richard but The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse hints that the grants might not have been paid. The last mention of Chaucer is on 5June 1400 when some debts owed to him were repaid. Chaucer died of unknown causes on 25October 1400 although the only evidence for this date comes from the engraving on his tomb which was erected more than 100 years after his death. There is some speculation that he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV but the case is entirely circumstantial. Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey in London as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbeys close. In 1556 his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb making him the first writer interred in the area now known as Poets Corner. Chaucer was a close friend of John of Gaunt the wealthy Duke of Lancaster and father of Henry IV and he served under Lancasters patronage. Near the end of their lives Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law when Lancaster married Katherine Swynford in 1396; she was the sister of Philippa Roet whom Chaucer had married in 1366. Chaucers The Book of the Duchess was written in commemoration of Blanche of Lancaster John of Gaunts first wife. The poem refers to John and Blanche in allegory as the narrator relates the tale of A long castel with walles whiteBe Seynt Johan on a ryche hil who is mourning grievously after the death of his love And goode faire White she hetThat was my lady name ryght . The phrase long castel is a reference to Lancaster walles white is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche Seynt Johan was John of Gaunts name-saint and ryche hil is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. White is the English translation of the French word blanche implying that the white lady was Blanche of Lancaster. Chaucers short poem Fortune believed to have been written in the 1390s is also thought to refer to Lancaster. Chaucer as narrator openly defies Fortune proclaiming that he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit and declares my suffisaunce and that over himself hath the maystrye . Fortune in turn does not understand Chaucers harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future but most importantly And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve . Chaucer retorts My frend maystow nat reven blind goddesse and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. Fortune turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesseThat to som beter estat he may atteyne . The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster York and Gloucester and a portion of line 76 is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes. Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucers beste frend. Fortune states three times in her response to the plaintiff And also you still have your best friend alive ; she also refers to his beste frend in the envoy when appealing to his noblesse to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at Fortune that she shall not take his friend from him. Chaucers attitudes toward the Church should not be confused with his attitudes toward Christianity. He seems to have respected and admired Christians and to have been one himself though he also recognised that many people in the church were venal and corrupt. He wrote in Canterbury Tales now I beg all those that listen to this little treatise or read it that if there be anything in it that pleases them they thank our Lord Jesus Christ for it from whom proceeds all understanding and goodness. Chaucers first major work was The Book of the Duchess an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster who died in 1368. Two other early works were Anelida and Arcite and The House of Fame. He wrote many of his major works in a prolific period when he held the job of customs comptroller for London . His Parlement of Foules The Legend of Good Women and Troilus and Criseyde all date from this time. It is believed that he started The Canterbury Tales in the 1380s. Chaucer also translated Boethius Consolation of Philosophy and The Romance of the Rose by Guillaume de Lorris . Eustache Deschamps called himself a nettle in Chaucers garden of poetry. In 1385 Thomas Usk made glowing mention of Chaucer and John Gower also lauded him. Chaucers Treatise on the Astrolabe describes the form and use of the astrolabe in detail and is sometimes cited as the first example of technical writing in the English language and it indicates that Chaucer was versed in science in addition to his literary talents.The equatorie of the planetis is a scientific work similar to the Treatise and sometimes ascribed to Chaucer because of its language and handwriting an identification which scholars no longer deem tenable. Chaucer wrote in continental accentual-syllabic metre a style which had developed in English literature since around the 12th century as an alternative to the alliterative Anglo-Saxon metre. Chaucer is known for metrical innovation inventing the rhyme royal and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line a decasyllabic cousin to the iambic pentametre in his work with only a few anonymous short works using it before him. The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming couplets first seen in his The Legend of Good Women was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important with the common humorous device the funny accent of a regional dialect apparently making its first appearance in The Reeves Tale. The poetry of Chaucer along with other writers of the era is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the Middle English language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects. This is probably overstated; the influence of the court chancery and bureaucracy of which Chaucer was a part remains a more probable influence on the development of Standard English. Modern English is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucers poems owing to the effect of the Great Vowel Shift some time after his death. This change in the pronunciation of English still not fully understood makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience. The status of the final -e in Chaucers verse is uncertain it seems likely that during the period of Chaucers writing the final -e was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. It may have been a vestige of the Old English dative singular suffix -e attached to most nouns. Chaucers versification suggests that the final -e is sometimes to be vocalised and sometimes to be silent; however this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised most scholars pronounce it as a schwa. Apart from the irregular spelling much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer with his ear for common speech is the earliest extant manuscript source. Acceptable alkali altercation amble angrily annex annoyance approaching arbitration armless army arrogant arsenic arc artillery and aspect are just some of almost two thousand English words first attested in Chaucer. Widespread knowledge of Chaucers works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. John Lydgate was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucers unfinished Tales while Robert Henrysons Testament of Cresseid completes the story of Cressida left unfinished in his Troilus and Criseyde. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucers works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the Romantic era poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later additions from original Chaucer. Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries such as John Dryden admired Chaucer for his stories but not for his rhythm and rhyme as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess. It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon accepted today was decided upon largely as a result of Walter William Skeats work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucers death The Canterbury Tales was selected by William Caxton to be one of the first books to be printed in England. Chaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a vernacular literature after the example of Dante in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucers own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary John Barbour and was likely to have been even more general as is evidenced by the example of the Pearl Poet in the north of England. Although Chaucers language is much closer to Modern English than the text of Beowulf such that a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of The Summoners Tale that compares Chaucers text to a modern translation The first recorded association of Valentines Day with romantic love is believed to be in Chaucers Parlement of Foules a dream vision portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates. Honouring the first anniversary of the engagement of fifteen-year-old King Richard II of England to fifteen-year-old Anne of Bohemia For this was on seynt Volantynys dayWhan euery bryd comyth there to chese his makeOf euery kynde that men thinke mayAnd that so heuge a noyse gan they makeThat erthe eyr tre euery lakeSo ful was that onethe was there spaceFor me to stonde so ful was al the place. The poet Thomas Hoccleve who may have met Chaucer and considered him his role model hailed Chaucer as the firste fyndere of our fair langage. John Lydgate referred to Chaucer within his own text The Fall of Princes as the lodesterre off our language. Around two centuries later Sir Philip Sidney greatly praised Troilus and Criseyde in his own Defence of Poesie. During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Chaucer came to be viewed as a symbol of the nations poetic heritage. In Charles Dickens 1850 novel David Copperfield the Victorian era author echoed Chaucers use of Luke 2334 from Troilus and Criseyde with G. K. Chesterton writing among the great canonical English authors Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common. The large number of surviving manuscripts of Chaucers works is testimony to the enduring interest in his poetry prior to the arrival of the printing press. There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales alone along with sixteen of Troilus and Criseyde including the personal copy of Henry IV. Given the ravages of time it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost. Chaucers original audience was a courtly one and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400 Chaucers audience had begun to include members of the rising literate middle and merchant classes. This included many Lollard sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own. Lollards were particularly attracted to Chaucers satirical writings about friars priests and other church officials. In 1464 John Baron a tenant farmer in Agmondesham was brought before John Chadworth the Bishop of Lincoln on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a boke of the Tales of Caunterburie among other suspect volumes. The first English printer William Caxton was responsible for the first two folio editions of The Canterbury Tales which were published in 1478 and 1483. Caxtons second printing by his own account came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the mans manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxtons edition was reprinted by his successor Wynkyn de Worde but this edition has no independent authority. Richard Pynson the Kings Printer under Henry VIII for about twenty years was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however in the process he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucers.  There is a likely connection between Pynsons product and William Thynnes a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546 as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucers works and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material there is not doubt this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucers work. The Workes of Geffray Chaucer published in 1532 was the first edition of Chaucers collected works. Thynnes editions of Chaucers Works in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian canon. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by Sir Brian Tuke. Thynnes canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28 even if that was not his intention. As with Pynson once included in the Works pseudepigraphic texts stayed with those works regardless of their first editors intentions. In the 16th and 17th centuries Chaucer was printed more than any other English author and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer canon began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucers Works set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucers reputation but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucers biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him. Probably the most significant aspect of the growing apocrypha is that beginning with Thynnes editions it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a proto-Protestant Lollard primarily the Testament of Love and The Plowmans Tale. As Chaucerian works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century these medieval texts enjoyed a new life with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympatheticor malleable enough to be construed as sympatheticto their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his Works was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done concurrently with William Langland and Piers Plowman. The famous Plowmans Tale did not enter Thynnes Works until the second 1542 edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynnes inclusion of Thomas Usks Testament of Love in the first edition. The Testament of Love imitates borrows from and thus resembles Usks contemporary Chaucer.  Since the Testament of Love mentions its authors part in a failed plot his imprisonment and a recantation of heresy all this was associated with Chaucer. John Foxe took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith calling Chaucer a right Wiclevian and identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of John Wycliffe at Merton College Oxford. No other sources for the Testament of Love existthere is only Thynnes construction of whatever manuscript sources he had. John Stow was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucers Works in 1561 brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century and they remained as late as 1810 well after Thomas Tyrwhitt pared the canon down in his 1775 edition. The compilation and printing of Chaucers works was from its beginning a political enterprise since it was intended to establish an English national identity and history that grounded and authorised the Tudor monarchy and church. What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England. In his 1598 edition of the Works Speght made good use of Usks account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the Testament of Love to assemble a largely fictional Life of Our Learned English Poet Geffrey Chaucer. Speghts Life presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the kings views on religion. Speght states In the second year of Richard the second the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people. Under the discussion of Chaucers friends namely John of Gaunt Speght further explains Later in The Argument to the Testament of Love Speght adds Speght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet Street as well as a fictitious coat of arms and family tree. Ironically and perhaps consciously so an introductory apologetic letter in Speghts edition from Francis Beaumont defends the unseemly low and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite classicist position. Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his Animadversions insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucers support for popular religious reform associating Chaucers views with his father William Thynnes attempts to include The Plowmans Tale and The Pilgrims Tale in the 1532 and 1542 Works. The myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucers works including neo-Marxism. Alongside Chaucers Works the most impressive literary monument of the period is John Foxes Acts and Monuments.... As with the Chaucer editions it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxes Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucers Works particularly the pseudepigrapha. Jack Upland was first printed in Foxes Acts and Monuments and then it appeared in Speghts edition of Chaucers Works. Speghts Life of Chaucer echoes Foxes own account which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the Testament of Love and The Plowmans Tale to their pages. Like Speghts Chaucer Foxes Chaucer was also a shrewd political survivor. In his 1563 edition Foxe thought it not out of season to couple some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer with a discussion of John Colet a possible source for John Skeltons character Colin Clout. It is significant too that Foxes discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther when Printing being opened incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment by which light darkness began to be espied and ignorance to be detected; truth from error religion from superstition to be discerned. Foxe downplays Chaucers bawdy and amorous writing insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric while the more forthright satire is taken literally. John Urry produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales according to the editors for the first time printed a biography of Chaucer a glossary of old English words and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards  Although Chaucers works had long been admired serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century when Thomas Tyrwhitt edited The Canterbury Tales and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century. Scholars such as Frederick James Furnivall who founded the Chaucer Society in 1868 pioneered the establishment of diplomatic editions of Chaucers major texts along with careful accounts of Chaucers language and prosody. Walter William Skeat who like Furnivall was closely associated with the Oxford English Dictionary established the base text of all of Chaucers works with his edition published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements along with critical commentary and bibliographies. With the textual issues largely addressed if not resolved attention turned to the questions of Chaucers themes structure and audience. The Chaucer Research Project at the University of Chicago began in 1924. The Chaucer Review was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies. In 1994 literary critic Harold Bloom placed Chaucer among the greatest Western writers of all time and in 1997 expounded on William Shakespeares debt to the author. The following major works are in rough chronological order but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucers output and works made up from a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period. Chaucer is one of the main characters in the 2001 film A Knights Tale and is portrayed by Paul Bettany.
John Gower,John Gower was an English poet a contemporary of William Langland and the Pearl Poet and a personal friend of Geoffrey Chaucer. He is remembered primarily for three major works the Mirour de lOmme Vox Clamantis and Confessio Amantis three long poems written in French Latin and English respectively which are united by common moral and political themes. Few details are known of Gowers early life. He was probably born into a family which held properties in Kent and Suffolk. Stanley and Smith use a linguistic argument to conclude that Gowers formative years were spent partly in Kent and partly in Suffolk. Southern and Nicolas conclude that the Gower family of Kent and Suffolk cannot be related to the Yorkshire Gowers because their coats of arms are drastically different. Macaulay and other critics have observed that he must have spent considerable time reading the Bible Ovid Secretum Secretorum Petrus Riga Speculum Speculationum Valerius Maximus John of Salisbury and others. He once met Richard II. In the prologue of the first recension of the Confessio Amantis he tells how the king chancing to meet him on the Thames invited him aboard the royal barge and that their conversation then resulted in a commission for the work that would become the Confessio Amantis. Later in life his allegiance switched to the future Henry IV to whom later editions of the Confessio Amantis were dedicated. Much of this is based on circumstantial rather than documentary evidence and the history of revisions of the Confessio Amantis including the different dedications is yet to be fully understood. The source of Gowers income remains a mystery. He may have practised law in or around London.George Campbell Macaulay lists several real estate transactions to which Gower was a party. Macaulays Introduction to the French Works suggests that Gower may have been a dealer in wool. This is based on remarks from Mirour d lOmme line 25360ff. From 1365 he received ten pounds rent for the manor of Wygebergh in Essex. From 1382 until death he received forty pounds per annum from selling Feltwell in Norfolk and Moulton in Suffolk. In 1399 Henry IV granted him a pension in the form of an annual allowance of two pipes of Gascony wine. Carlson estimates the value of the two pipes as 3 to 4 pounds wholesale or 8 pounds retail. Gowers friendship with Chaucer is also well documented. When Chaucer was sent as a diplomat to Italy in 1378 Gower was one of the men to whom he gave power of attorney over his affairs in England. The two poets also paid one another compliments in their verse Chaucer dedicated his Troilus and Criseyde in part to moral Gower and Gower reciprocated by placing a speech in praise of Chaucer in the mouth of Venus at the end of the Confessio Amantis . The Introduction to the Man of Laws Tale contains an apparent reference to Gowers tales of Canacee and Tyro Appolonius. Tyrwhitt believed that this offended Gower and led to the removal of Venus praise of Chaucer. Twentieth century sources have more innocent reasons for the deletion. At some point during the middle 1370s he took up residence in rooms provided by the Priory of St Mary Overie . In 1398 while living here he married probably for the second time his wife was Agnes Groundolf who survived him. In his last years and possibly as early as 1400 he became blind. After his death in 1408 Gower was interred in an ostentatious tomb in the Priory church where it remains today. Macaulay provides much information and speculation about Gower. Some of his conclusions are inferences drawn from the trilingual writings of Gower. Where possible he draws upon legal records and other biographers. Gowers verse is by turns religious political historical and moralthough he has been narrowly defined as moral Gower ever since Chaucer graced him with the epithet. His primary mode is allegory although he shies away from sustained abstractions in favour of the plain style of the raconteur. His earliest works were probably ballades in Anglo-Norman French some of which may have later been included in his work the Cinkante Ballades. The first work which has survived is in the same language however it is the Speculum Meditantis also known by the French title Mirour de lOmme a poem of just under 30000 lines containing a dense exposition of religion and morality. According to Yeager Gowers first intent to write a poem for the instructional betterment of king and court at a moment when he had reason to believe advice about social reform might influence changes predictably to take place in an expanded jurisdiction when the French and English peoples were consolidated under a single crown. Gowers second major work the Vox Clamantis was written in Latin. The first book has an allegorical account of the Peasants Revolt which begins as an allegory becomes quite specific and ends with an allusion to William Walworths suppression of the rebels. Gower takes the side of the aristocracy but the actions of Richard II are described by the captain in vain endeavoured to direct the ships course.Subsequent books decry the sins of various classes of the social order priests friars knights peasants merchants lawyers. The last two books give advice to King Richard II and express the poets love for England. As Gower admits much of Vox Clamantis was borrowed from other authors. Macaulay refers to this as schoolboy plagiarism Peter classifies Mirour and Vox as complaint literature in the vein of Langland. His third work is the Confessio Amantis a 30000-line poem in octosyllabic English couplets which makes use of the structure of a Christian confession as a narrative frame within which a multitude of individual tales are told. Like his previous works the theme is very much morality even where the stories themselves have a tendency to describe rather immoral behaviour. One scholar asserts that Confessio Amantis almost exclusively made Gowers poetic reputation. They provide as organized and unified a view as we have of the social ideals on England upon the eve of the Renaissance. This view may be subsumed under the three broad headings individual VIRTUE legal JUSTICE and the administrative responsibility of the KING. The works progress from the description of the origins of sin and the nature of the vices and virtues at the beginning of the Mirour de lomme through consideration of social law and order in the discussion of the three estates in the Mirour and Vox Clamatis to a final synthesis of royal responsibiity of Empedoclean love in the Confessio Amantis. In later years Gower published a number of minor works in all three languages  Critics have speculated on which late work triggered the royal wine allowance mentioned in the Life section. Candidates are Cronica tripertitaIn Praise of PeaceO Recolende or an illustrated presentation copy of Confessio with dedication to Henry IV. According to Meyer-Lee no known evidence relates the collar or grant to his literary activity. Gowers poetry has had a mixed critical reception. In the 16th century he was generally regarded alongside Chaucer as the father of English poetry. In the 18th and 19th centuries however his reputation declined largely on account of a perceived didacticism and dullness; e.g. the American poet and critic James Russell Lowell claimed Gower positively raised tediousness to the precision of science. After publication of Macaulays edition of the complete works he has received more recognition notably by C. S. Lewis Wickert Fisher Yeager and Peck . However he has not obtained the same following or critical acceptance as Geoffrey Chaucer. When Wickert was attempting to date Vox Clamantis Books Two to Seven she found two passages which predict the revolt. One is Mirour which uses the metaphor of the stinging nettle to predict the impending catastrophe. The second is the final couplet of Vox Clamantis Book Five Chapter 10. This predicts trouble in a short time. Gowers warnings and call for reform were ignored both before and after the events of 1381. Chaucer used octosyllabic lines in The House of Fame but eschewed iambic rhythm. He left it to Gower to invent the iambic tetrameter and to later centuries of poets to solve the problems of its potential monotony; he himself merely polished the traditional Middle English short line. Fisher concludes that they were living near each other in the period 1376 to 1386. They influenced each other in several ways Sebastian Sobeckis discovery of the early provenance of the trilingual Trentham manuscript reveals Gower as a poet who was not afraid to give Henry IV stern political advice. Sobecki also claims to have identified Gowers autograph hand in two manuscripts. Rigby Stephen H ed. . Historians on John Gower. Woodbridge D.S. Brewer. ISBN9781843845379.
William Langland,William Langland is the presumed author of a work of Middle English alliterative verse generally known as Piers Plowman an allegory with a complex variety of religious themes. The poem translated the language and concepts of the cloister into symbols and images that could be understood by a layman. Little is known of Langland himself. It seems that he was born in the West Midlands of England around 1330 according to internal evidence in Piers Plowman. The narrator in Piers Plowman receives his first vision while sleeping in the Malvern Hills which suggests some connection to the area. The dialect of the poem is also consistent with this part of the country. Piers Plowman was written c. 1377 as the characters imagination says he has followed him for five and forty winters. A fifteenth-century note in the Dublin manuscript of Piers Plowman says that Langland was the son of Stacy de Rokayle. Langland is believed to have been born in Cleobury Mortimer Shropshire although Ledbury Herefordshire and Great Malvern Worcestershire also have strong claims to being his birthplace. There is a plaque to that effect in the porch of Cleobury Mortimers parish church which also contains a memorial window placed in 1875 depicting the Piers Plowman vision. Langland is thought to have been a novitiate of Woodhouse Friary located nearby. There are strong indications that Langland died in 1385 or 1386. A note written by Iohan but in a fourteenth-century manuscript of the poem makes direct reference to the death of its author whan this werke was wrouyt ere Wille myte aspie Deth delt him a dent and drof him to the erthe And is closed vnder clom . According to Edith Rickert John But himself seems to have died in 1387 indicating that Langland died shortly before this date. Nonetheless some scholars believe Langland was the author of a 1399 work Richard the Redeless. Most of what is believed about Langland has been reconstructed from Piers Plowman. The C text of the poem contains a passage in which the narrator describes himself as a loller or idler living in the Cornhill area of London and refers to his wife and child who are respectively named Katherine and Nicolette. It also suggests that he was well above average height and made a living reciting prayers for the dead in chantries at St Pauls Cathedral. However the distinction between allegory and reality in Piers Plowman is blurred and the entire passage as Wendy Scase observes is reminiscent of the false confession tradition in medieval literature . A similar passage in the final Passus of the B and C texts provides further ambiguous details on the poets wife and his torments by Elde including baldness gout and impotence. This may indicate that the poet had reached middle age by the 1370s but the accuracy of the passage is called into question by the conventional nature of the description and the fact that it occurs near the end of the poem when Wills personal development is reaching its logical conclusion. The detailed and highly sophisticated religious knowledge displayed in the poem indicates that Langland had some connection to the clergy but the nature of this relationship is uncertain. The poem shows no obvious bias towards any particular group or order of churchmen but is even-handed in its anticlericalism. This makes it difficult to align Langland with any specific order. He is probably best regarded John Bowers writes as a member of that sizable group of unbeneficed clerks who formed the radical fringe of contemporary society ... the poorly shod Will is portrayed y-robed in russet traveling about the countryside a crazed dissident showing no respect to his superiors. Malcolm Godden has proposed that he lived as an itinerant hermit attaching himself to a patron temporarily and exchanging writing services for shelter and food. Robert Crowleys 1550 edition of Piers Plowman promoted the idea that Langland was a follower of John Wycliffe. However this conclusion is challenged by early Lollard appropriation of the Plowman figure . It is true that Langland and Wycliffe shared many concerns Both questioned the value of indulgences and pilgrimages promoted the use of the vernacular in preaching attacked clerical corruption and even advocated disendowment. However these topics were widely discussed throughout the late 14th century and were not specifically associated with Wycliffe until after the presumed time of Langlands death. Also as Pamela Gradon observes at no point does Langland echo Wycliffes characteristic teachings on the sacraments. The attribution of Piers Plowman to Langland rests principally on the evidence of a manuscript held at Trinity College Dublin . This manuscript ascribes Piers Plowman to Willielmi de Langland son of Stacy de Rokayle who died in Shipton-under-Wychwood a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire. Other manuscripts name the author as Robert or William Langland or Wilhelms W. . The poem itself also seems to point to Langlands authorship. At one point the narrator remarks I have lived in londe my name is longe wille . This can be taken as a coded reference to the poets name in the style of much late-medieval literature . However it has also been suggested that medieval scribes and readers may have understood this line as referring to a William Longwille the pseudonym used by a Norfolk rebel in 1381. Although there is little other evidence Langlands authorship has been widely accepted since the 1920s. It is not however entirely beyond dispute as recent work by Stella Pates and C. David Benson has demonstrated.
Margery Kempe,Margery Kempe was an English Christian mystic known for writing through dictation The Book of Margery Kempe a work considered by some to be the first autobiography in the English language. Her book chronicles her domestic tribulations her extensive pilgrimages to holy sites in Europe and the Holy Land as well as her mystical conversations with God. She is honoured in the Anglican Communion but has not been canonised as a Catholic saint. She was born Margery Burnham or Brunham around 1373 in Bishops Lynn Norfolk England. Her father John Brunham was a merchant in Lynn mayor of the town and Member of Parliament. The first record of her Brunham family is a mention of her grandfather Ralph de Brunham in 1320 in the Red Register of Lynn. By 1340 he had joined the Parliament of Lynn. Kempes kinsman Robert Brunham possibly her brother became a Member of Parliament for Lynn in 1402 and 1417. No records remain of any formal education that Kempe may have received. As an adult a priest read to her works of religious devotion in English which suggests that she might have been unable to read them herself although she seems to have learned various texts by heart. As one would expect Kempe appears to have been taught the Pater Noster Ave Maria the Ten Commandments and other virtues vices and articles of faith. At around twenty years of age Kempe married John Kempe who became a town official in 1394. Margery and John had at least fourteen children. A letter survives from Gdańsk which identifies the name of her eldest son as John and gives a reason for his visit to Lynn in 1431. Kempe was an orthodox Catholic and like other medieval mystics believed that she was summoned to a greater intimacy with Christ as a result of multiple visions and experiences she had as an adult. After the birth of her first child Kempe went through a period of crisis for nearly eight months which may perhaps have been an episode of postpartum psychosis. During her illness Kempe claimed to have envisioned numerous devils and demons attacking her and commanding her to forsake her faith her family and her friends; she claims that they even encouraged her to commit suicide. She also had a vision of Jesus Christ in the form of a man who asked her Daughter why have you forsaken me and I never forsook you. Kempe affirms that she had visitations and conversations with Jesus Mary God and other religious figures and that she had visions of being an active participant during the birth and crucifixion of Christ. These visions and hallucinations physically affected her bodily senses causing her to hear sounds and smell unknown strange odours. She also reports hearing a heavenly melody that made her weep and want to live a chaste life. According to Beal Margery found other ways to express the intensity of her devotion to God. She prayed for a chaste marriage went to confession two or three times a day prayed early and often each day in church wore a hair shirt and willingly suffered whatever negative responses her community expressed in response to her extreme forms of devotion. Kempe was also known throughout her community for her constant weeping as she begged Christ for mercy and forgiveness. In Kempes vision Christ reassured her that he had forgiven her sins. He gave her several commands to call him her love to stop wearing the hair shirt to give up eating meat to take the Eucharist every Sunday to pray the rosary only until six oclock to be still and speak to him in thought; he also promised her that he would give her victory over her enemies give her the ability to answer all clerks and that will be with her and never forsake her and to help her and never be parted from her. Kempe did not join a religious order but carried out her life of devotion prayer and tears in public. Her visions provoked her public displays of loud wailing sobbing and writhing which frightened and annoyed both clergy and laypeople. At one point in her life she was imprisoned by the clergy and town officials and threatened with the possibility of rape; however she does not record being sexually assaulted. Finally during the 1420s she dictated her Book known today as The Book of Margery Kempe which illustrates her visions mystical and religious experiences as well as her temptations to lechery her travels and her trial for heresy. Kempes book is commonly considered to be the first autobiography written in the English language. Kempe was tried for heresy multiple times but never convicted; she mentions with pride her ability to deny the accusations of Lollardy with which she was faced. Possible reasons for her arrests include her preaching her wearing of all white as a married woman or her apparent belief that she could pray for the souls of those in purgatory and tell whether or not someone was damned in a manner similar to the concept of the intercession of saints. Kempe was also accused of preaching without Church approval as her public speeches skirted a thin line between making statements about her personal faith and professing to teach scripture. During an inquiry into her heresy she was thought to be possessed by a devil for quoting the scripture and reminded of the prohibition against women preachers in 1 Timothy. Kempe proved to be something of a nuisance in the communities where she resided as her frantic wailing and extreme emotional responses seemed to imply a superior connection to God that some other lay people saw as diminishing their own or inappropriately privileged above the relationship between God and the clergy. Nearly everything that is known of Kempes life comes from her spiritual autobiography known as the Book. In the early 1430s despite her illiteracy Kempe decided to record her spiritual life. In the preface to the book she describes how she employed as a scribe an Englishman who had lived in Germany but he died before the work was completed and what he had written was unintelligible to others. This may possibly have been John Kempe her eldest son. She then persuaded a local priest who may have been her confessor Robert Springold to begin rewriting on 23 July 1436 and on 28 April 1438 he started work on an additional section covering the years 14314. The narrative of Kempes Book begins with the difficult birth of her first child. After describing the demonic torment and Christic apparition that followed Kempe undertook two domestic businesses a brewery and a grain mill . Both failed after a short period of time. Although she tried to be more devout she was tempted by sexual pleasures and social jealousy for some years. Eventually turning away from her worldly work Kempe dedicated herself completely to the spiritual calling that she felt her earlier vision required. Striving to live a life of commitment to God Kempe in the summer of 1413 negotiated a chaste marriage with her husband. Although chapter 15 of The Book of Margery Kempe describes her decision to lead a celibate life chapter 21 mentions that she is pregnant once again. It has been speculated that Kempe gives birth to a child her last during her pilgrimage; she later relates that she brought a child with her when she returned to England. It is unclear whether the child was conceived before the Kempes began their celibacy or in a momentary lapse after it. Sometime around 1413 Kempe visited the female mystic and anchoress Julian of Norwich at her cell in Norwich. According to her own account Kempe visited Julian and stayed for several days. She was especially eager to obtain Julians approval for her visions of and conversations with God. The text reports that Julian approved of Kempes revelations and gave Kempe reassurance that her religiosity was genuine. However Julian did instruct and caution Kempe to measure these experiences according to the worship they accrue to God and the profit to her fellow Christians. Julian also confirmed that Kempes tears were physical evidence of the Holy Spirit in soul. Kempe also received affirmation of her gifts of tears by way of approving comparison to a continental holy woman. In chapter 62 Kempe describes an encounter with a friar who was relentless in his accusation for her incessant tears. The friar admitted to having read of Marie of Oignies and recognised that Kempes tears were also a result of similar authentic devotion. During this time Kempes spiritual confessor was Richard Caister the Vicar of St Stephens Church Norwich who was buried in the church in 1420. Kempe prayed at Caisters burial place for the healing of a priest; after the priest was healed Caisters burial place became a shrine for pilgrimage. In 1438 the year her book is known to have been completed a Margueria Kempe who may well have been Margery Kempe was admitted to the Trinity Guild of Lynn. It is not known whether this is the same woman however and it is unknown when or where after this date Kempe died. The manuscript was copied probably shortly before 1450 by someone who signed himself Salthows on the bottom portion of the final page. This scribe has been shown to be the Norwich monk Richard Salthouse. The manuscript contains annotations by four hands. The first page of the manuscript contains the rubric Liber Montis Gracie. This boke is of Mountegrace making certain that some of the annotations are the work of monks associated with the important Carthusian priory of Mount Grace in Yorkshire. Although the four readers largely concerned themselves with correcting mistakes or emending the manuscript for clarity there are also remarks about the Books substance and some images which reflect Kempes themes and images. A recipe added to the final folio of the manuscript by a late 14th- or early 15th-century reader of the Book possibly at the cathedral priory in Norwich provides more evidence of its readership and has been determined to be for medicinal sweets or digestives called dragges. Kempes book was essentially lost for centuries being known only from excerpts published by Wynkyn de Worde in around 1501 and by Henry Pepwell in 1521. However in 1934 a manuscript was found in the private library of the Butler-Bowdon family and then consulted by Hope Emily Allen. It has since been reprinted and translated in numerous editions. Part of Kempes significance lies in the autobiographical nature of her book; it is the best insight available of a female middle-class experience in the Middle Ages. Kempe is unusual compared to contemporaneous holy women such as Julian of Norwich because she unlike Julian was not a nun. Although Kempe has sometimes been depicted as an oddity or a madwoman recent Her Book is revealed as a carefully constructed spiritual and social commentary. Some have suggested that it was written as fiction to explore the aspects of the society in which she lived in a believable way. The suggestion that Kempe wrote her book as a work of fiction is said to be supported by the fact that she speaks of herself as this creature throughout the text dissociating her from her work. However this might equally be only a way of showing her humility as a lowly creature of God. Her autobiography begins with the onset of her spiritual quest her recovery from the ghostly aftermath of her first child-bearing. There is no firm evidence that Kempe could read or write but Leyser notes that her religious culture was certainly informed by texts. She had such works read to her including the by Richard Rolle; Walter Hilton has been cited as another possible influence on Kempe. Among other books that Kempe had read to her were repeatedly the Revelations of Bridget of Sweden. Her own pilgrimages were related to those of that married saint who had had eight children. Kempe and her Book are significant because they express the tension in late medieval England between institutional orthodoxy and increasingly public modes of religious dissent especially those of the Lollards. Throughout her spiritual career Kempe was challenged by both church and civil authorities on her adherence to the teachings of the institutional Church. The Bishop of Lincoln and the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Arundel were involved in trials of her allegedly teaching and preaching on scripture and faith in public and wearing white clothes . In his efforts to suppress heresy Arundel had enacted laws that forbade allowing women to preach since the very fact of a woman preaching was seen as anti-canonical. In the 15th century a pamphlet was published that represented Kempe as an anchoress and stripped from her Book any potential heterodoxical thought and dissenting behaviour. That made some later scholars believe that she was a vowed religious holy woman like Julian of Norwich and they were surprised to encounter the psychologically and spiritually complex woman revealed in the original text of the Book. During the 14th century the task of interpreting the Bible and God through the written word was nominally restricted to men specifically ordained priests. Because of this restriction women mystics often expressed their experience of God differently through the senses and the body especially in the late Middle Ages. Mystics directly experienced God in three classical ways first bodily visions meaning to be aware with ones senses sight sound or others; second ghostly visions such as spiritual visions and sayings directly imparted to the soul; and lastly intellectual enlightenment where ones mind came into a new understanding of God. Kempe was motivated to make a pilgrimage by hearing or reading the English translation of Bridget of Swedens Revelations. This work promotes the purchase of indulgences at holy sites; these were pieces of paper representing the pardoning by the Church of purgatorial time otherwise owed after death due to sins. Kempe went on many pilgrimages and is known to have purchased indulgences for friends enemies the souls trapped in Purgatory and herself. In 1413 soon after her fathers death Kempe left her husband to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During the winter she spent 13 weeks in Venice but she talks little about her observations of Venice in her book. At the time Venice was at the height of its medieval splendor rich in commerce and holy relics. From Venice Kempe travelled to Jerusalem via Ramlah. Kempes voyage from Venice to Jerusalem is not a large part of her story overall. It is thought that she passed through Jaffa which was the usual port for pilgrims who were heading to Jerusalem. One vivid detail that she recalls was her riding on a donkey when she saw Jerusalem for the first time probably from Nabi Samwil and that she nearly fell off the donkey because she was in such shock from the vision in front of her. During her pilgrimage Kempe visited places that she saw to be holy. She was in Jerusalem for three weeks and went to Bethlehem where Christ was born. She visited Mount Zion which was where she believed Jesus had washed his disciples feet. Kempe visited the burial places of Jesus his mother Mary and the cross itself. Finally she went to the River Jordan and Mount Quarentyne which was where they believed Jesus had fasted for forty days and Bethany where Martha Mary and Lazarus had lived. After she visited the Holy Land Kempe returned to Italy and stayed in Assisi before going to Rome. Like many other medieval English pilgrims Kempe resided at the Hospital of Saint Thomas of Canterbury in Rome. During her stay she visited many churches including San Giovanni in Laterano Santa Maria Maggiore Santi Apostoli San Marcello and St Birgittas Chapel. She did not leave Rome until Easter 1415. When Kempe returned to Norwich she passed through Middelburg . In 1417 Kempe set off again on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain travelling via Bristol where she stayed at Henbury with Thomas Peverel bishop of Worcester. On her return from Spain she visited the shrine of the holy blood at Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire and then went on to Leicester. Kempe recounts several public interrogations during her travels. One followed her arrest by the Mayor of Leicester who accused her in Latin of being a cheap whore a lying Lollard and threatened her with prison. After Kempe was able to insist on the right of accusations to be made in English and to defend herself she was briefly cleared but then brought to trial again by the Abbot Dean and Mayor and imprisoned for three weeks. After this Kempe continued on to York. Here she had many friends with whom she wept and attended Mass. She also encountered further accusation specifically of heresy of which she was eventually found innocent by the Archbishop. She returned to Lynn some time in 1418. She visited important sites and religious figures in England including Philip Repyngdon Henry Chichele and Thomas Arundel . During the 1420s Kempe lived apart from her husband. When he fell ill however she returned to Lynn to be his nursemaid. Their son who lived in Germany also returned to Lynn with his wife. However both her son and husband died in 1431. The last section of Kempes book deals with a journey beginning in April 1433 aiming to travel to Danzig with her daughter-in-law. From Danzig Kempe visited the Holy Blood of Wilsnack relic. She then travelled to Aachen and returned to Lynn via Calais Canterbury and London . Margery Kempe is honoured in the Church of England with a commemoration on 9 November and in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America together with Richard Rolle and Walter Hilton on 9 November. In 2018 the Mayor of Kings Lynn Nick Daubney unveiled a bench commemorating Kempe in the Saturday Market Place. The bench was designed by local furniture-maker Toby Winteringham and sponsored by the Kings Lynn Civic Society. There is a Margery Kempe Society founded in 2018 by Laura Kalas of Swansea University and Laura Varnam of University College Oxford whose aim is the support and promotion of the scholarship study and teaching of The Book of Margery Kempe. In 2020 a statue in honour of Kempe was erected at the entrance of a medieval bridge in Oroso in Northern Spain on the pilgrimage trail she would have followed to Santiago de Compostela. Kempes life and her Book have been the subject of several dramatic portrayals
Thomas Malory,Sir Thomas Malory was an English writer the author of Le Morte dArthur the classic English-language chronicle of the Arthurian legend compiled and in most cases translated from French sources. The most popular version of Le Morte dArthur was published by the famed London printer William Caxton in 1485. Much of Malorys life history is obscure but he identified himself as a knight prisoner apparently reflecting that he was either a criminal a prisoner-of-war or suffering some other type of confinement. Malorys identity has never been confirmed. Since modern scholars began researching his identity the most widely accepted candidate has been Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel in Warwickshire who was imprisoned at various times for criminal acts and possibly also for political reasons during the Wars of the Roses. Recent work by Cecelia Lampp Linton however presents new evidence in support of Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers Yorkshire. Most of what is known about Malory stems from the accounts describing him in the prayers found in the Winchester Manuscript of Le Morte dArthur. He is described as a knyght presoner distinguishing him from several other candidates also bearing the name Thomas Malory in the 15th century when Le Morte dArthur was written. At the end of the Tale of King Arthur is written For this was written by a knight prisoner Thomas Malleorre that God send him good recovery. At the end of The Tale of Sir Gareth And I pray you all that readeth this tale to pray for him that this wrote that God send him good deliverance soon and hastily. At the conclusion of the Tale of Sir Tristram Here endeth the second book of Sir Tristram de Lyones which was drawn out of the French by Sir Thomas Malleorre knight as Jesu be his help. Finally at the conclusion of the whole book The Most Piteous Tale of the Morte Arthure Sanz Gwerdon par le shyvalere Sir Thomas Malleorre knight Jesu aide ly pur votre bon mercy. a mix of English and French roughly meaning The most pitiable tale of the Death of Arthur without reward forby the knight Sir Thomas Malory; Jesus aid him by your good mercy. However all these are replaced by Caxton with a final colophon reading I pray you all gentlemen and gentlewomen that readeth this book of Arthur and his knights from the beginning to the ending pray for me while I am alive that God send me good deliverance and when I am dead I pray you all pray for my soul. For this book was ended the ninth year of the reign of King Edward the Fourth by Sir Thomas Maleore knight as Jesu help him for his great might as he is the servant of Jesu both day and night. With the exception of the first sentence of the final colophon all the above references to Thomas Malory as a knight are grammatically speaking in the third person singular which leaves open the possibility that they were added by a copyist either in Caxtons workshop or elsewhere. However scholarly consensus is that these references to knighthood refer to a real person and that that person is the author of Le Morte dArthur. The author was educated as most of his material was drawn out of the French which suggests a degree of French fluency indicating that he might have been from a wealthy family. A claimants age must also fit the time of writing; as described below this has been a major point of contention among all modern scholars for determining the authors identity. Since the late 19th century there has been a great deal of scholarly research into the identity of Sir Thomas Malory author of Le Morte dArthur. As detailed below the earliest modern investigations suggested that Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel was the only Thomas Malory living in 15th-century England who was a knight. However the apparently great age of this candidate at the time of the works completion has always been a source of contention. In the early 20th century scholarly revelations of this candidates extensive criminal record and multiple imprisonments threw further doubt on the matter because of a perceived discordance with the chivalric ideals espoused in Le Morte dArthur. The discovery of the Winchester Manuscript in 1934 revealed that the author was in some form of imprisonment at the time of writing; this has generally been taken to support the candidate from Newbold Revel though the support is ambiguous because that candidates extensive prison record does not actually include the time of writing. These tensions have inspired scholars to propose alternative identities; most notably Thomas Malory of Papworth St. Agnes and Moreton Corbet and Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers and Studley Royal. Both are much less attested in the documentary record than the candidate from Newbold Revel. As described in detail below neither is clearly recorded as having been a knight but both come from knightly families and could plausibly have been knighted. Both seem to have been of a more appropriate age at the time of writing but neither is known to have been imprisoned at any time. To date no candidate for authorship has ever consistently commanded widespread support other than Malory of Newbold Revel. However despite the evidence for other candidates being no more than circumstantial eminent scholars suggest that the question of the authors identity is both critically important and yet unresolved.However Linton argues that Malory of Hutton Conyers was a knight of the church and as her recent work garners scholarly attention it may bring the matter into different focus. Since George Lyman Kittredge a professor at Harvard published the first significant investigation into Malorys identity in 1894 the primary candidate for authorship has been Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel in Warwickshire. Kittredge discovered a record of this Malorys service under Richard de Beauchamp 13th Earl of Warwick in William Dugdales Antiquities of Warwickshire stating of Sir Thomas Dugdales history also revealed that this Malory had served as a Member of Parliament and recorded the date of his death the location of his tomb and many other details of his life and family. As Dugdale lived in Warwickshire and apparently had access to Malorys home and direct descendants during a time when Le Morte remained very popular and was still being printed scholars have noted that any mention of his authoring Le Morte is conspicuously absent in Dugdales record. To date however this candidate for authorship remains the only Thomas Malory known to be living at the time of writing who was clearly recorded as having been a knight. Kittredge accepted the details of Dugdales history at face value specifically that he was commissioned to serve at Calais under Henry V; a campaign which took place in 141415. Under this view Malory would have been a junior officer in Henry Vs famous Battle of Agincourt a member of what William Shakespeare cemented in popular memory as the Band of Brothers in the famous St. Crispins Day Speech. However subsequent scholars have questioned this interpretation suggesting that Dugdales record was erroneous and that Malory instead served under Henry VI at an action in Calais in 1436 a brief mobilization which was disbanded without combat and which Dugdale in their view erroneously called a siege. P.J.C. Field suggests that the first public record of this Malory in 1439 is an indication of when he reached the date of his majority . Scholars consider the question of this timeline to be important in determining authorship as the original timeline would place Malorys birth in the early to mid 1390s. He would therefore have been at least 75 when Le Morte was completed as he must have been at least in his late teens or early 20s at the time of his commission his peers of the same rank in Dugdales record were in their mid- to late-twenties. According to the alternate timeline his birth would have been around 1415-1418 and his age would have been a much more reasonable 55 to 58 years when Le Morte was completed. William Matthews emphasizes the importance of Malorys age thus There is considerable evidence that the medieval view was that by sixty a man was bean fodder and forage ready for nothing but deaths pit... it might be best to find out how old the Warwickshire knight really was in 1469. Researching the question Matthews made an original discovery Sir William Dugdales surviving 15th century notes and papers in the Bodleian Library on the Agincourt campaign contain a lengthy military roster with the following detail Thomas Mallory est retenuz a j lance et ij archers pr sa launce ouve j archer xx li par an et bouche de court et pour lautre archer x marcs saunz bouche de court. Because this original French note perfectly matches the English translation in Dugdales published work and because a number of the other knights listed on the same commission roster are known to have died long before 1436 Matthews concludes that these commissions cannot refer to the 1436 campaign; and therefore Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel must have been commissioned into Henry Vs Agincourt campaign around 1414 or 1415 confirming Kittredges original timeline and making this Malory in his mid-70s to early 80s at the time the book was completed. Matthews asserts seventy-five is no age at all to be writing Le Morte Darthur in prison. Linton comes to Dugdales defense disputing the need for an alternative timeline. She notes that scholars have accepted Dugdales account of this Malory without question except for the matter of his age. She agrees with other scholars that Dugdale knew the Malorys of Newbold Revel and suggests that he would have certainly made the connection between this Malory and Le Morte if there were any connection to be made. Much more detail was added to Thomas Malory of Newbold Revels biography by Edward Hicks in 1928 revealing that this Thomas Malory had been imprisoned as a thief bandit kidnapper attempted murderer and rapist; which hardly seemed in keeping with the high chivalric standards of his book.Helen Cooper referred to his life as one that reads more like an account of exemplary thuggery than chivalry. Shortly before his death C.S. Lewis stated that this issue was a grave one for readers of Le Morte Darthur. E.K. Chambers emphasizes the importance of the problem by quoting the author himself Chambers comments Surely the Sir Thomas of Monks Kirby could not have written this without a twinge. Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel was born to Sir John Malory of Winwick Northamptonshire who had served as a Justice of the Peace in Warwickshire and as a Member of Parliament and Lady Phillipa Malory heiress of Newbold. He was knighted before 8 October 1441 became a professional soldier and served under Henry de Beauchamp 1st Duke of Warwick. While it is not recorded how he became distinguished he acted as an elector in Northamptonshire. However in 1443 he and accomplice Eustace Barnaby were accused of attacking kidnapping and stealing 40 pounds worth of goods from Thomas Smythe though nothing came of this charge. He married a woman named Elizabeth Walsh with whom he had at least one son named Robert and possibly one or two other children. Despite the criminal charges against him he seems to have remained in good standing with his peers because in that same year Malory was elected by the men of Warwickshire to Parliament to serve as a knight of the shire for the rest of 1443 and was appointed to a royal commission charged with the distribution of money to impoverished towns in Warwickshire. In 144950 he was returned as member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn a seat controlled by the Duke of Buckingham. Malorys status changed abruptly in 1451 when he was accused of ambushing Humphrey Stafford 1st Duke of Buckingham a prominent Lancastrian in the Wars of the Roses along with 26 other men sometime in 1450. The accusation was never proved. Later in 1451 he was accused of extorting 100 shillings from Margaret King and William Hales of Monks Kirby and then of committing the same crime against John Mylner for 20 shillings. He was also accused of breaking into the house of Hugh Smyth of Monks Kirby in 1450 stealing 40 pounds worth of goods and raping Smyths wife and with attacking her again in Coventry eight weeks later. At this period a charge of rape could also apply to some acts of consensual sex and some nonsexual crimes; several scholars have suggested that the accusation did not refer to rape as it is now defined. However P.J.C. Fields analysis of the specific Latin terminology of the charges concludes that they were intended to refer to actual rapes. On 15 March 1451 Malory and 19 others were ordered to be arrested. Nothing came of this and in the following months Malory and his cohorts were charged with a series of crimes especially violent robberies. At one point he was arrested and imprisoned in Maxstoke Castle but he escaped swam the moat and returned to Newbold Revel. Nellie Slayton Aurner points out that most of these crimes seem to have been targeted at the property and followers of the Duke of Buckingham; and that as Malory was a supporter of the family of Buckinghams former rival the Duke of Warwick there may have been a political motive behind either Malorys attacks or Buckingham and others bringing charges against him. Aurner suggests that Malorys enemies tried to slander him giving evidence that the Duke of Buckingham was Malorys long-time enemy. Malory finally came to trial on 23 August 1451 in Nuneaton a town in the heartland of Buckinghams power and a place where Malory found little favour as a supporter of the Beauchamps. Those accused included Malory and several others; there were numerous charges. Malory was convicted and sent to the Marshalsea Prison in London where he remained for a year. He demanded a retrial with a jury of men from his own county. Although this never took place he was released. By March 1452 he was back in the Marshalsea from which he escaped two months later possibly by bribing the guards and gaolers. After a month he was back in prison yet again and this time he was held until the following May when he was released on bail of 200 pounds paid by a number of his fellow magnates from Warwickshire. Malory later ended up in custody in Colchester accused of still more crimes involving robbery and the stealing of horses. Once again he escaped and once again was apprehended and returned to Marshalsea Prison. From Malorys first criminal charge in 1443 through his eighth charge in 1451 after several escapes from captivity little was done to contain his actions. In 1451 a royal arrest order was issued followed by increasing fines on the lords overseeing his imprisonment in case of his escape culminating in a maximum fine of 2000 lbs set by the Kings Bench in June of 1455. As Malory aged through several subsequent imprisonments fines for his escape decreased to 1000 lbs and then 450 lbs in January and October of 1457 and then 100 lbs if not captured when he was somehow at large again despite no formal release in 1458. Malory was released as part of a general pardon at the accession of King Edward IV in 1461. After 1461 few records survive which scholars agree refer to Malory of Newbold Revel. In 1468-1470 King Edward VI issued four more general pardons which specifically excluded a Thomas Malory. The first of these names Malory a knight; and applied to participants in a campaign in Northumberland in the North of England by members of the Lancastrian faction. P.J.C. Field interprets these pardon-exclusions to refer to Malory of Newbold Revel suggesting that Malory changed his allegiance from York to Lancaster and that he was involved in a conspiracy with Richard Neville 16th Earl of Warwick to overthrow King Edward. Matthews having shown that Malory of Newbold Revel was likely in his seventies by the time of the Northumberland campaign and living much further to the South interprets this record as referring to a different candidate for authorship. No record survives of Malory of Newbold Revel being in prison at the time Le Morte was completed. As Field describes Repeated scholarly searches of legal records have found no trace of arrest charge trial or verdict that would place any Thomas Malory in prison at the time documented by the author in the Winchester manuscript. Field suggests that Malorys political rivals simply put him in prison without formal charge and that he could have been released from prison in October 1470 at the collapse of the Yorkist regime and the temporary return to the throne of Henry VI. In 1462 Malory settled his estate on his son Robert and in 1466 or 1467 Robert fathered a son named Nicholas Malorys grandson and ultimate heir. Malory died on 14 March 1471 and was buried in Christ Church Greyfriars near Newgate Prison. His interment there suggests that his misdeeds had been forgiven and that he possessed some wealth. However it was certified at the granting of probate that he owned little wealth of his own having settled his estate on his son in 1462. Malorys grandson Nicholas eventually inherited his lands and was appointed High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1502. Dugdale writing in the early to mid-17th century recorded that the following inscription had been engraved on Malorys tomb HIC JACET DOMINUS THOMAS MALLERE VALENS MILES OB 14 MAR 1470 DE PAROCHIA DE MONKENKIRBY IN COM WARICINI meaning Here lies Lord Thomas Mallere Valiant Soldier. Died 14 March 1470 in the parish of Monkenkirby in the county of Warwick. The tomb itself had been lost when Greyfriars was destroyed in 1538 under King Henry VIII in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Linton in her defense of Dugdales account notes that he never offered a connection between the Newbold Revel Malory and Le Morte even though the book was well known in Dugdales time. Shortly after Kittredges original article on Malory of Newbold Revel a second candidate was presented in an 1897 article in Athenaeum by A.T. Martin who proposed that the author was Thomas Malory of Papworth St Agnes on the Huntingdonshire-Cambridgeshire border. Martins argument was based on a will made at Papworth on 16 September 1469 and proved at Lambeth Palace on 27 October the same year. This identification was taken seriously for some time by editors of Malory including Alfred W. Pollard the noted bibliographer who included it in his edition of Malory published in 1903. This Thomas Malory was born on 6 December 1425 at Moreton Corbet Castle Shropshire the eldest son of Sir William Mallory member of Parliament for Cambridgeshire who had married Margaret the widow of Robert Corbet of Moreton Corbet. Thomas inherited his fathers estates in 1425 and was placed in the wardship of the King initially as a minor but later remaining there until within four months of his death in 1469. Richard R. Griffin later provided further support for this candidate in The Authorship Question Reconsidered. Published after Matthewss book promoting the Hutton Conyers candidate Griffin makes several arguments; most notably that the Papworth candidates dialect would match that of Le Morte more closely than either of the other candidates. As detailed below a leading dialect expert identified the language of Le Morte as being most characteristic of Lincolnshire. Griffith points out that while the current candidate lived in Shropshire as a child and on the Cambridgeshire-Huntingdonshire border in adulthood both his father and grandfather were from Lincolnshire; and that neither of the other two major candidates had any known connection to Lincolnshire. Little else is known of this Malory apart from one peculiar incident discovered by William Matthews. A collection of Chancery proceedings includes a petition brought against Malory by Richard Kyd parson of Papworth claiming that Malory ambushed him on a November evening and took him from Papworth to Huntingdon and then to Bedford and on to Northampton all the while threatening his life and demanding that he either forfeit his church to Malory or give him 100 pounds. The outcome of this case is unknown but it seems to indicate that this Malory was something other than an ordinary country gentleman. However while this candidates father and several other close family members were knights no clear evidence survives showing that this Malory was ever actually knighted. The third contender emerged in the mid-20th century Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers and Studley Royal in Yorkshire. This claim was put forward in 1966 in The Ill-Framed Knight A Skeptical Inquiry into the Identity of Sir Thomas Malory by William Matthews a British professor who taught at UCLA . This contender is also championed by Linton. Matthews makes many arguments for this candidate with his main focus on linguistic clues both in the Winchester manuscript and the Caxton edition of Le Morte dArthur; including distinctive dialectal and stylistic elements such as alliteration that are characteristic of northerly writing. His claim drew scholarly attention including a review co-written by eminent medievalist E. F. Jacob and the famed linguist Angus McIntosh. Neither reviewer accepted Matthewss claims entirely. Jacob agrees that the dialect of Le Morte is not that of Warwickshire deferring to McIntosh for a more detailed dialectal analysis while noting that Matthews makes a good case for reopening the question of Malorys identity. Linton however disputes several of McIntoshs arguments presenting a data driven analysis of the dialect in the Morte. Besides this analysis she dismisses some of McIntoshs arguments as trivial noting quibbles between what dialect is northern and what is northerly for example. McIntoshs dialectal analysis states that To put the matter simply the original Le Morte Darthur contained various forms which are too northerly for the everyday language of Newbold Revel. While McIntosh does not specifically support Matthews claim of an origin in the Hutton Conyers area of Yorkshire he ultimately concludes that the language would have been most at home in Lincolnshire but is characteristic of roughly anywhere north of a line from Chester to the Wash . He suggests that Malory simply had access to and was deeply steeped in far more northerly romance material than the specific texts which he is thought to have used. Two central elements of Matthewss argument for the Hutton Conyers candidate include his evidence of the advanced age of the Newbold Revel candidate at the time of writing described in that section above; and Matthewss analysis of the exclusion of a Thomas Malarie knight from a general pardon issued in 1468. The question of the identity of the Malory listed in this document is widely regarded as critical to the final identification of the author. In P.J.C. Fields words the Sir Thomas Malory who was exempted from pardon must have been the author of the Morte. No other conclusion is possible. While Fields conclusion is widely accepted Linton suggests he has attributed it to the wrong Malory arguing that Malory of Hutton Conyers a close associate of Neville is the likely knight exempted from that pardon. The pardon applied to a group of Lancastrians in a military campaign in the winter of 1462 in the Northern county of Northumberland near the Scottish border. Matthews shows that Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers was closely related to the Humphrey Neville knight listed just before him in the short list of those excluded. Matthews also points out that this Northern campaign was geographically much closer to Hutton Conyers in Yorkshire than to Newbold Revel and concludes that the document referred to the Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers - not to Malory of Newbold Revel who was a Yorkist and would have been something in excess of 70 years old; far too old to have taken part in this Northern military campaign. Matthews therefore promotes this document as strong evidence that Malory of Hutton Conyers was indeed a knight after all and the author of the Morte. Linton offers additional evidence to illustrate the close connection between Humphrey Neville and Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers. Matthewss interpretation was not universally accepted primarily because he could not find evidence that the Yorkshireman was a knight. Linton however has removed that principal objection providing extensive detail about the Malorys of Yorkshire and offering evidence that Thomas of Yorkshire was a Knight Hospitaller a knight of the church. She also examines the provenance of some of the known sources of the Morte and demonstrates that this Malory would have had ready access to these documents. In spite of Matthewss strong evidence of the Newbold Revel knights advanced age P.J.C. Field has long argued that the 1468 exclusion from pardon refers to Malory of Newbold Revel and instead shows that that candidate changed his lifelong Yorkist loyalty to become a Lancastrian. It seems equally plausible however to realize that the Knight Hospitaller from Hutton Conyers who was close to Neville was excluded from pardon rather than to think the Newbold Revel knight changed political stripes. Outside of the contested pardon-exclusion Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers was not recorded as having been a knight in the generally accepted secular sense though his elder brother John and most of his recent forefathers were knights. If we accept Lintons argument that the Yorkshire Thomas was a Knight Hospitaller the primary objection to his authorship is removed and the contradictions presented by the Newbold Revel knight become irrelevant.  Even only a few years after the original publication of Le Morte there was speculation as to Malorys identity. The earliest identification was made by John Bale a 16th-century antiquarian who declared that Malory was Welsh hailing from Mailoria on the River Dee. This theory received further support from Sir John Rhys who proclaimed in 1893 that the alternative spelling indicated an area straddling the border between England and North Wales Maleore in Flintshire and Maleor in Denbighshire. On this theory Malory may have been related to Edward Rhys Maelor a 15th-century Welsh poet. It was also suggested by antiquary John Leland that he was Welsh identifying Malory with Maelor. However most modern scholars have disregarded this early work on the basis that no such place as Mailoria has ever been identified on the Dee or elsewhere; no Welsh Thomas Malory appears in the surviving historical record; and Malory identified himself as English rather than Welsh. Malorys Le Morte dArthur is the source of the modern form of most Arthurian mythology and is the only major work of English literature between Geoffrey Chaucer around a century earlier and Shakespeare around a century later. It has been called the first English novel. Malorys main sources for his work included Arthurian French prose romances mainly the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate cycles Geoffrey of Monmouths Historia Regum Britanniae and two anonymous English works called the Alliterative Morte Arthure and the Stanzaic Morte Arthur. The entire work is eight romances that span twenty-one books with 507 chapters which was said to be considerably shorter than the original French sources despite its vast size. Malory was responsible for organizing these diverse sources and consolidating them into a cohesive whole. The work was originally titled The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table but printer William Caxton changed it to Le Morte dArthur before he printed it in 1485 as well as making several other editorial changes. According to one theory the eight romances were originally intended to be separate but Caxton altered them to be more unified. There has been some argument among critics that Malorys Le Morte dArthur was primarily intended as a political commentary of Malorys own era. Malory portrays an initially idyllic past under the strong leadership of King Arthur and his knights but as intrigue and infighting develop the utopic kingdom collapses which may have been intended as a parallel and a warning against the infighting taking place during the Wars of the Roses. The seemingly contradictory changes in King Arthurs character throughout the work have been argued to support the theory that Arthur represents different eras and reigns throughout the tales. This argument has also been used to attempt to reconcile Malorys doubtful reputation as a person who continually changed sides with the unexpected idealism of Le Morte dArthur. It remains a matter of some debate whether this was a deliberate commentary or an imaginative fiction influenced by the political climate. All these arguments it should be noted depend upon acceptance of the Newbold Revel Malory as the author. The sources of the romances that make up Le Morte dArthur and Malorys treatment of those sources correspond to some degree with those of a poem called The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle; they also both end with a similarly worded prayer to be released from imprisonment. This has led some scholars in recent years to believe that Malory may have been the author of the poem. A young Malory appears as a character at the end of T. H. Whites book The Once and Future King which was based on Le Morte dArthur. This cameo is included in the Broadway musical Camelot and in its film adaptation where his name is given as Tom of Warwick; reflecting the general acceptance of Malory of Newbold Revel as the author through most of the 20th century despite the criminal history of that candidate in his later life. In addition to Whites treatment many other modern versions of the Arthurian legend have their roots in Malory including John Boormans film Excalibur . The discovery of Malorys book and its acquisition by William Caxton form key elements in The Load of Unicorn a childrens novel by Cynthia Harnett.
Thomas More,Sir Thomas More venerated in the Catholic Church as Saint Thomas More was an English lawyer judge social philosopher author statesman and noted Renaissance humanist. He also served Henry VIII as Lord High Chancellor of England from October 1529 to May 1532. He wrote Utopia published in 1516 which describes the political system of an imaginary island state. More opposed the Protestant Reformation directing polemics against the theology of Martin Luther Huldrych Zwingli and William Tyndale. More also opposed Henry VIIIs separation from the Catholic Church refusing to acknowledge Henry as supreme head of the Church of England and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. After refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy he was convicted of treason on what he claimed was false evidence and executed. On his execution he was reported to have said I die the Kings good servant and Gods first. Pope Pius XI canonised More in 1935 as a martyr.Pope John Paul II in 2000 declared him the patron saint of statesmen and politicians. Born on Milk Street in the City of London on 7 February 1478 Thomas More was the son of Sir John More a successful lawyer and later a judge and his wife Agnes . He was the second of six children. More was educated at St. Anthonys School then considered one of Londons best schools. From 1490 to 1492 More served John Morton the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England as a household page. Morton enthusiastically supported the New Learning and thought highly of the young More. Believing that More had great potential Morton nominated him for a place at the University of Oxford . More began his studies at Oxford in 1492 and received a classical education. Studying under Thomas Linacre and William Grocyn he became proficient in both Latin and Greek. More left Oxford after only two yearsat his fathers insistenceto begin legal training in London at New Inn one of the Inns of Chancery. In 1496 More became a student at Lincolns Inn one of the Inns of Court where he remained until 1502 when he was called to the Bar. More could speak Latin with the same facility as English. He played the flute and viol and wrote poetry. According to his friend the theologian Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam More once seriously contemplated abandoning his legal career to become a monk. Between 1503 and 1504 More lived near the Carthusian monastery outside the walls of London and joined in the monks spiritual exercises. Although he deeply admired their piety More ultimately decided to remain a layman standing for election to Parliament in 1504 and marrying the following year. More continued ascetic practices for the rest of his life such as wearing a hair shirt next to his skin and occasionally engaging in self-flagellation. A tradition of the Third Order of Saint Francis honours More as a member of that Order on their calendar of saints. More married Joanna Jane Colt in 1505. In that year he leased a portion of a house known as the Old Barge on Bucklersbury St Stephen Walbrook parish London. Eight years later he took over the rest of the house and in total he lived there for almost 20 years until his move to Chelsea in 1525.Erasmus reported that More wanted to give his young wife a better education than she had previously received at home and tutored her in music and literature. The couple had four children Margaret Elizabeth Cecily and John. Jane died in 1511. Going against friends advice and common custom within 30 days More had married one of the many eligible women among his wide circle of friends. He chose Alice Middleton a widow to head his household and care for his small children. The speed of the marriage was so unusual that More had to get a dispensation from the banns of marriage which due to his good public reputation he easily obtained. More had no children from his second marriage although he raised Alices daughter from her previous marriage as his own. More also became the guardian of two young girls Anne Cresacre who would eventually marry his son John More; and Margaret Giggs who was the only member of his family to witness his execution . An affectionate father More wrote letters to his children whenever he was away on legal or government business and encouraged them to write to him often. More insisted upon giving his daughters the same classical education as his son an unusual attitude at the time. His eldest daughter Margaret attracted much admiration for her erudition especially her fluency in Greek and Latin. More told his daughter of his pride in her academic accomplishments in September 1522 after he showed the bishop a letter she had written When he saw from the signature that it was the letter of a lady his surprise led him to read it more eagerly he said he would never have believed it to be your work unless I had assured him of the fact and he began to praise it in the highest terms for its pure Latinity its correctness its erudition and its expressions of tender affection. He took out at once from his pocket a portague to send to you as a pledge and token of his good will towards you. Mores decision to educate his daughters set an example for other noble families. Even Erasmus became much more favourable once he witnessed their accomplishments. A large portrait of More and his extended family including his dogs and monkey Sir Thomas More and Family was painted by Holbein; however it was lost in a fire in the 18th century. Mores grandson commissioned a copy of which two versions survive. Concerning Mores personality Erasmus gave a consistent portrait over a period of thirty five years. Soon after meeting the young lawyer More who became his best friend he reported in 1500 Did nature ever invent anything kinder sweeter or more harmonious than the character of Thomas More. In 1519 he wrote that More was born and designed for friendship; no one is more open-hearted in making friends or more tenacious in keeping them. In 1535 after Mores execution Erasmus wrote that More never bore ill-intent towards anyone. In 1504 More was elected to Parliament to represent Great Yarmouth and in 1510 began representing London. From 1510 More served as one of the two undersheriffs of the City of London a position of considerable responsibility in which he earned a reputation as an honest and effective public servant. Interested in public health he became a Commissioner for Sewers in 1514. More became Master of Requests in 1514 the same year in which he was appointed as a Privy Counsellor. After undertaking a diplomatic mission to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V accompanying Thomas Wolsey Cardinal Archbishop of York to Calais and Bruges More was knighted and made under-treasurer of the Exchequer in 1521. As secretary and personal adviser to King Henry VIII More became increasingly influential welcoming foreign diplomats drafting official documents and serving as a liaison between the King and Lord Chancellor Wolsey. More later served as High Steward for the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1523 More was elected as knight of the shire for Middlesex and on Wolseys recommendation the House of Commons elected More its Speaker. In 1525 More became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster with executive and judicial responsibilities over much of northern England. After Wolsey fell More succeeded to the office of Lord Chancellor in 1529. He dispatched cases with unprecedented rapidity. In 1532 he was responsible for an anti-pollution act. More supported the Catholic Church and saw the Protestant Reformation as heresy a threat to the unity of both church and society. More believed in the theology argumentation and ecclesiastical laws of the church and heard Luthers call to destroy the Catholic Church as a call to war. More wrote several books against the first edition of Tyndales English translation of the New Testament. More wrote the Dialogue concerning Heresies Tyndale responded with An Answer to Sir T. Mores Dialogue and More replied with his Confutation of Tyndales Answer . More also wrote or contributed to several other anti-Lutheran books. One of Mores criticisms of the initial Tyndale translation was that despite claiming to be in the vernacular Tyndale had employed numerous neologisms for example Jehovah scapegoat Passover atonement mercy seat shewbread. More also accused Tyndale of deliberately avoiding common translations in favour of biased words such as using the emotion love instead of the practical action charity for Greek using the neologism senior instead of priest for the Greek and the latinate congregation instead of church. Tyndales bibles include text other than the scriptures some of Tyndales prefaces were direct translations of Martin Luther and it included marginal glosses which challenged Catholic doctrine. One notable exchange occurred over Mores attack on Tyndales use of congregation. Tyndale pointed out that he was following your darling Erasmus Latin translation of ecclesia by congregatio. More replied that Erasmus needed to coin congregatio because there was no good Latin word while English had the perfectly fine church but that the intent and theology under the words were all important I have not contended with Erasmus my darling because I found no such malicious intent with Erasmus my darling as I find with Tyndale. For had I found with Erasmus my darling the cunning intent and purpose that I find in Tyndale Erasmus my darling should be no more my darling. But I find in Erasmus my darling that he detests and abhors the errors and heresies that Tyndale plainly teaches and abides by and therefore Erasmus my darling shall be my dear darling still. And surely if Tyndale had either never taught them or yet had the grace to revoke them then should Tyndale be my dear darling too. But while he holds such heresies still I cannot take for my darling him that the devil takes for his darling. There is considerable variation in opinion on the extent and nature of Mores prosecution of heretics witness in recent popular media the difference in portrayals of More in A Man for All Seasons and in Wolf Hall. The English establishment initially regarded Protestants as akin to the Lollards and Hussites whose heresies fed their sedition. Ambassador to Charles V Cuthbert Tunstall called Lutheranism the foster-child of the Wycliffite heresy that had underpinned Lollardy. Burning at the stake had been a standard punishment for heresy 30 burnings had taken place in the century before Mores elevation to Chancellor and burning continued to be used by both Catholics and Protestants during the religious upheaval of the following decades. During Mores chancellorship six people were burned at the stake for heresy; they were Thomas Hitton Thomas Bilney Richard Bayfield John Tewkesbury Thomas Dusgate and James Bainham. Some stories emerged in Mores lifetime regarding persecution of the Protestant heretics during his time as Lord Chancellor and he denied them in detail in his Apologia . Many stories were later published by the popular sixteenth-century English Protestant historian John Foxe in his polemical Book of Martyrs. Foxe was instrumental in publicising accusations of torture claiming that More had often personally used violence or torture while interrogating heretics. Later authors such as Brian Moynahan and Michael Farris cite Foxe when repeating these allegations although Diarmaid MacCulloch while claiming Mores relish for burning heretics finds no evidence that he was directly involved.Richard Marius maintained that in office More did everything in his power to bring about the extermination of Protestant heretics. Peter Ackroyd also lists claims from Foxes Book of Martyrs and other post-Reformation sources that More tied heretics to a tree in his Chelsea garden and whipped them that he watched as newe men were put upon the rack in the Tower and tortured until they confessed and that he was personally responsible for the burning of several of the brethren in Smithfield. Historian John Guy commented that such charges are unsupported by independent proof. Marius records a similar claim which tells about James Bainham and writes that the story Foxe told of Bainhams whipping and racking at Mores hands is universally doubted today. Stories of a similar nature were current even in Mores lifetime and he denied them forcefully. He admitted that he did imprison heretics in his house theyr sure kepynge he called it but he utterly rejected claims of torture and whipping... as help me God. More instead claimed in his Apology that he only applied corporal punishment to two heretics a child servant in his household who was caned for repeating a heresy regarding the Eucharist and a feeble-minded man who was whipped for disrupting the mass by raising womens skirts over their heads at the moment of consecration More taking the action to prevent a lynching. Ackroyd states that More zealously approved of burning. John Tewkesbury was a London leather seller found guilty by the Bishop of London John Stokesley of harbouring English translated New Testaments; he was sentenced to burning for refusing to recant. More declared he burned as there was neuer wretche I wene better worthy. After Richard Bayfield was also executed for distributing Tyndales Bibles More commented that he was well and worthely burned. Moynahan argued that More influenced the eventual execution of William Tyndale in the Duchy of Brabant as English agents had long pursued Tyndale. This was despite the fact that the execution took place on October 6 1536 several years after More had resigned as Chancellor and been executed as well as in a totally different country. Modern commentators are divided over Mores religious actions as Chancellor. Some biographers including Ackroyd have taken a relatively tolerant view of Mores campaign against Protestantism by placing his actions within the turbulent religious climate of the time and the threat of deadly catastrophes such as the German Peasants Revolt which More blamed on Luther as did many others such as Erasmus. Others have been more critical such as Richard Marius an American scholar of the Reformation believing that such persecutions were a betrayal of Mores earlier humanist convictions including Mores zealous and well-documented advocacy of extermination for Protestants. Some Anglicans take a different view. In 1980 More was added to the Church of Englands calendar of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church despite being a fierce opponent of the English Reformation that created the Church of England. He was added jointly with John Fisher to be commemorated every 6 July as Thomas More scholar and John Fisher Bishop of Rochester Reformation Martyrs 1535. Pope John Paul II honoured him by making him patron saint of statesmen and politicians in October 2000 stating It can be said that he demonstrated in a singular way the value of a moral conscience ... even if in his actions against heretics he reflected the limits of the culture of his time. As the conflict over supremacy between the Papacy and the King reached its peak More continued to remain steadfast in supporting the supremacy of the Pope as Successor of Peter over that of the King of England. Parliaments reinstatement of the charge of praemunire in 1529 had made it a crime to support in public or office the claim of any authority outside the realm to have a legal jurisdiction superior to the Kings. In 1530 More refused to sign a letter by the leading English churchmen and aristocrats asking Pope Clement VII to annul Henrys marriage to Catherine of Aragon and also quarrelled with Henry VIII over the heresy laws. In 1531 a royal decree required the clergy to take an oath acknowledging the King as Supreme Head of the Church of England. The bishops at the Convocation of Canterbury in 1532 agreed to sign the Oath but only under threat of praemunire and only after these words were added as far as the law of Christ allows. This was considered to be the final Submission of the Clergy. Cardinal John Fisher and some other clergy refused to sign. Henry purged most clergy who supported the papal stance from senior positions in the church. More continued to refuse to sign the Oath of Supremacy and did not agree to support the annulment of Henrys marriage to Catherine. However he did not openly reject the Kings actions and kept his opinions private. On 16 May 1532 More resigned from his role as Chancellor but remained in Henrys favour despite his refusal. His decision to resign was caused by the decision of the convocation of the English Church which was under intense royal threat on the day before. In 1533 More refused to attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn as the Queen of England. Technically this was not an act of treason as More had written to Henry seemingly acknowledging Annes queenship and expressing his desire for the Kings happiness and the new Queens health. Despite this his refusal to attend was widely interpreted as a snub against Anne and Henry took action against him. Shortly thereafter More was charged with accepting bribes but the charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence. In early 1534 More was accused by Thomas Cromwell of having given advice and counsel to the Holy Maid of Kent Elizabeth Barton a nun who had prophesied that the king had ruined his soul and would come to a quick end for having divorced Queen Catherine. This was a month after Barton had confessed which was possibly done under royal pressure and was said to be concealment of treason. Though it was dangerous for anyone to have anything to do with Barton More had indeed met her and was impressed by her fervour. But More was prudent and told her not to interfere with state matters. More was called before a committee of the Privy Council to answer these charges of treason and after his respectful answers the matter seemed to have been dropped. On 13 April 1534 More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary Act of Succession. More accepted Parliaments right to declare Anne Boleyn the legitimate Queen of England though he refused the spiritual validity of the kings second marriage and holding fast to the teaching of papal supremacy he steadfastly refused to take the oath of supremacy of the Crown in the relationship between the kingdom and the church in England. More furthermore publicly refused to uphold Henrys annulment from Catherine. John Fisher Bishop of Rochester refused the oath along with More. The oath reads In addition to refusing to support the Kings annulment or supremacy More refused to sign the 1534 Oath of Succession confirming Annes role as queen and the rights of their children to succession. Mores fate was sealed. While he had no argument with the basic concept of succession as stated in the Act the preamble of the Oath repudiated the authority of the Pope. His enemies had enough evidence to have the King arrest him on treason. Four days later Henry had More imprisoned in the Tower of London. There More prepared a devotional Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation. While More was imprisoned in the Tower Thomas Cromwell made several visits urging More to take the oath which he continued to refuse. The charges of high treason related to Mores violating the statutes as to the Kings supremacy and conspiring with Bishop John Fisher in this respect and according to some sources included asserting that Parliament did not have the right to proclaim the Kings Supremacy over the English Church. One group of scholars believes that the judges dismissed the first two charges and tried More only on the final one but others strongly disagree. Regardless of the specific charges the indictment related to violation of the Treasons Act 1534 which declared it treason to speak against the Kings Supremacy If any person or persons after the first day of February next coming do maliciously wish will or desire by words or writing or by craft imagine invent practise or attempt any bodily harm to be done or committed to the kings most royal person the queens or their heirs apparent or to deprive them or any of them of their dignity title or name of their royal estates That then every such person and persons so offending shall have and suffer such pains of death and other penalties as is limited and accustomed in cases of high treason. The trial was held on 1 July 1535 before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas Audley as well as Anne Boleyns uncle Thomas Howard 3rd Duke of Norfolk her father Thomas Boleyn and her brother George Boleyn. Norfolk offered More the chance of the kings gracious pardon should he reform his obstinate opinion. More responded that although he had not taken the oath he had never spoken out against it either and that his silence could be accepted as his ratification and confirmation of the new statutes. Thus More was relying upon legal precedent and the maxim qui tacet consentire videtur understanding that he could not be convicted as long as he did not explicitly deny that the King was Supreme Head of the Church and he therefore refused to answer all questions regarding his opinions on the subject. Thomas Cromwell at the time the most powerful of the Kings advisors brought forth Solicitor General Richard Rich to testify that More had in his presence denied that the King was the legitimate head of the Church. This testimony was characterised by More as being extremely dubious. Witnesses Richard Southwell and Mr. Palmer were also present and both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation. As More himself pointed out The jury took only fifteen minutes however to find More guilty. After the jurys verdict was delivered and before his sentencing More spoke freely of his belief that no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality . According to William Ropers account More was pleading that the Statute of Supremacy was contrary to the Magna Carta to Church laws and to the laws of England attempting to void the entire indictment against him.He was sentenced to be hanged drawn and quartered but the King commuted this to execution by decapitation. The execution took place on 6 July 1535 at Tower Hill. When he came to mount the steps to the scaffold its frame seeming so weak that it might collapse More is widely quoted as saying I pray you master Lieutenant see me safe up and my coming down let me shift for my self; while on the scaffold he declared that he died the kings good servant and Gods first. Theologian Scott W. Hahn notes that the widely misquoted but Gods first is a line from Robert Bolts popular stage play A Man For All Seasons which differs from his actual words. After More had finished reciting the Miserere while kneeling the executioner reportedly begged his pardon then More rose up merrily kissed him and gave him forgiveness. Another comment he is believed to have made to the executioner is that his beard was completely innocent of any crime and did not deserve the axe; he then positioned his beard so that it would not be harmed. More asked that his fosteradopted daughter Margaret Clement be given his headless corpse to bury. She was the only member of his family to witness his execution. He was buried at the Tower of London in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in an unmarked grave. His head was fixed upon a pike over London Bridge for a month according to the normal custom for traitors. Mores daughter Margaret later rescued the severed head. It is believed to rest in the Roper Vault of St Dunstans Church Canterbury perhaps with the remains of Margaret and her husbands family. Some have claimed that the head is buried within the tomb erected for More in Chelsea Old Church. Among other surviving relics is his hair shirt presented for safe keeping by Margaret Clement. This was long in the custody of the community of Augustinian canonesses who until 1983 lived at the convent at Abbotskerswell Priory Devon. Some sources including one from 2004 claimed that the shirt made of goat hair was then at the Martyrs church on the Weld familys estate in Chideock Dorset. It is now preserved at Buckfast Abbey near Buckfastleigh in Devon. Between 1512 and 1519 More worked on a History of King Richard III which he never finished but which was published after his death. The History is a Renaissance biography remarkable more for its literary skill and adherence to classical precepts than for its historical accuracy. Some consider it an attack on royal tyranny rather than on Richard III himself or the House of York. More uses a more dramatic writing style than had been typical in medieval chronicles; Richard III is limned as an outstanding archetypal tyranthowever More was only seven years old when Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 so he had no first-hand in-depth knowledge of him. The History of King Richard III was written and published in both English and Latin each written separately and with information deleted from the Latin edition to suit a European readership. It greatly influenced William Shakespeares play Richard III. Modern historians attribute the unflattering portraits of Richard III in both works to both authors allegiance to the reigning Tudor dynasty that wrested the throne from Richard III in the Wars of the Roses. According to Caroline Barron Archbishop John Morton in whose household More had served as a page .mw-parser-output div.crossreferencepadding-left0 had joined the 1483 Buckingham rebellion against Richard III and Morton was probably one of those who influenced Mores hostility towards the defeated king.Clements Markham asserts that the actual author of the chronicle was in large part Archbishop Morton himself and that More was simply copying or perhaps translating Mortons original material. Mores best known and most controversial work Utopia is a frame narrative written in Latin. More completed the book and theologian Erasmus published it in Leuven in 1516. It was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More and the narratortraveller Raphael Hythlodaeus discuss modern ills in Antwerp as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia among themselves as well as to Pieter Gillis and Hieronymus van Busleyden. Utopias original edition included a symmetrical Utopian alphabet omitted by later editions but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of shorthand. Utopia is structured into two parts both with much irony Book I has conversations between friends on various European political issues the treatment of criminals the enclosure movement etc.; Book II is a remembered discourse by Raphael Hythlodaeus on his supposed travels in which the earlier issues are revisited in fantastical but concrete forms that has been called mythical idealism. For example the proposition in the Book I no republic can be prosperous or justly governed where there is private property and money is the measure of everything. Utopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs . In Utopia there are no lawyers because of the laws simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view communal ownership supplants private property men and women are educated alike and there is almost complete religious toleration . More may have used monastic communalism as his model although other concepts he presents such as legalising euthanasia remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. A scholar has suggested that More is most interested in the type of citizen Utopia produces. Some take the novels principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically Hythlodaeus who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics addresses Mores ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the Kings servant pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality. Utopia gave rise to a literary genre Utopian and dystopian fiction which features ideal societies or perfect cities or their opposite. Early works influenced by Utopia included New Atlantis by Francis Bacon Erewhon by Samuel Butler and Candide by Voltaire. Although Utopianism combined classical concepts of perfect societies with Roman rhetorical finesse the Renaissance genre continued into the Age of Enlightenment and survives in modern science fiction. In 1520 the reformer Martin Luther published three works in quick succession An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church and On the Liberty of a Christian Man . In these books Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone rejected certain Catholic practices and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church. In 1521 Henry VIII formally responded to Luthers criticisms with the Assertio written with Mores assistance.Pope Leo X rewarded the English king with the title Fidei defensor for his work combating Luthers heresies. Martin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print calling him a pig dolt and liar. At the kings request More composed a rebuttal the Responsio ad Lutherum was published at the end of 1523. In the Responsio More defended papal supremacy the sacraments and other Church traditions. More though considered a much steadier personality described Luther as an ape a drunkard and a lousy little friar amongst other epithets. Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus More tells Luther that His saying is followed with a kind of apology to his readers while Luther possibly never apologized for his sayings.Stephen Greenblatt argues More speaks for his ruler and in his opponents idiom; Luther speaks for himself and his scatological imagery far exceeds in quantity intensity and inventiveness anything that More could muster. If for More scatology normally expresses a communal disapproval for Luther it expresses a deep personal rage. Confronting Luther confirmed Mores theological conservatism. He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority. In 1528 More published another religious polemic A Dialogue Concerning Heresies that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church established by Christ and the Apostles and affirmed the validity of its authority traditions and practices. In 1529 the circulation of Simon Fishs Supplication for the Beggars prompted More to respond with the Supplycatyon of Soulys. In 1531 a year after Mores father died William Tyndale published An Answer unto Sir Thomas Mores Dialogue in response to Mores Dialogue Concerning Heresies. More responded with a half million words the Confutation of Tyndales Answer. The Confutation is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale with More addressing each of Tyndales criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines. More who valued structure tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole. Most major humanists were prolific letter writers and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam however only a small portion of his correspondence survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence letters to fellow humanist scholars several epistolary tracts verse epistles prefatory letters to several of Mores own works letters to Mores children and their tutors and the so-called prison-letters which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution. More also engaged in controversies most notably with the French poet Germain de Brie which culminated in the publication of de Bries Antimorus . Erasmus intervened however and ended the dispute. More also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include A Treatise on the Passion A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body and De Tristitia Christi . More handwrote the last in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto confessor of Emperor Charles V. Mores friend Luis Vives received it in Valencia where it remains in the collection of Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi museum. Pope Leo XIII beatified Thomas More John Fisher and 52 other English Martyrs on 29 December 1886. Pope Pius XI canonised More and Fisher on 19 May 1935 and Mores feast day was established as 9 July. Since 1970 the General Roman Calendar has celebrated More with St John Fisher on 22 June . On 31 October 2000 Pope John Paul II declared More the heavenly Patron of Statesmen and Politicians. More is the patron of the German Catholic youth organisation Katholische Junge Gemeinde. In 1980 despite their opposition to the English Reformation More and Fisher were added as martyrs of the reformation to the Church of Englands calendar of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church to be commemorated every 6 July as Thomas More scholar and John Fisher Bishop of Rochester Reformation Martyrs 1535. The annual remembrance of 6 July is recognized by all Anglican Churches in communion with Canterbury including Australia Brazil Canada and South Africa. In an essay examining the events around the addition to the Anglican calendar Scholar William Sheils links the reasoning for Mores recognition to a long-standing tradition hinted at in Rose Macaulays ironic debating point of 1935 about Mores status as an unschismed Anglican a tradition also recalled in the annual memorial lecture held at St. Dunstans Church in Canterbury where Mores head is said to be buried. Sheils also noted the influence of the 1960s popular play and film A Man for All Seasons which gave More a reputation as a defender of the right of conscience. Thanks to the plays depiction this brought his life to a broader and more popular audience with the film extending its impact worldwide following the Oscar triumphs. Around this time the atheist Oxford historian and public intellectual Hugh Trevor-Roper held More up as the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know the most saintly of Humanists...the universal man of our cool northern Renaissance. By 1978 the quincentenary of Mores birth Trevor-Roper wrote an essay putting More in the Renaissance Platonist tradition and claim his reputation was quite independent of his Catholicism.  The steadfastness and courage with which More maintained his religious convictions and his dignity during his imprisonment trial and execution contributed much to Mores posthumous reputation particularly among Roman Catholics. His friend Erasmus defended Mores character as more pure than any snow and described his genius as such as England never had and never again will have. Upon learning of Mores execution Emperor Charles V said Had we been master of such a servant we would rather have lost the best city of our dominions than such a worthy councillor. G. K. Chesterton a Roman Catholic convert from the Church of England predicted More may come to be counted the greatest Englishman or at least the greatest historical character in English history.Hugh Trevor-Roper called More the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know the most saintly of humanists the most human of saints the universal man of our cool northern renaissance. Jonathan Swift an Anglican wrote that More was a person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced. Some consider this quote to be of Samuel Johnson although its not found in Johnsons writings. The metaphysical poet John Donne also honoured as a hero by Anglicans was Mores great-great-nephew. US Senator Eugene McCarthy had a portrait of More in his office. Roman Catholic scholars maintain that More used irony in Utopia and that he remained an orthodox Christian. Marxist theoreticians such as Karl Kautsky considered the book a critique of economic and social exploitation in pre-modern Europe and More is claimed to have influenced the development of socialist ideas. In 1963 Moreana an academic journal focusing on analysis of More and his writings was founded. In 2002 More was placed at number 37 in the BBCs poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. More debated Christopher St Germain through various books while agreeing on various issues on equity More disagreed with secret witnesses the admissibility of hearsay and found St Germains criticism of religious courts superficial or ignorant. More and St Germains views on equity owed in part to the 15th Century humanist theologian Jean Gerson who taught that consideration of the individual circumstances should be the norm not the exception. Before More English Lord Chancellors tended to be clerics ; from More on they tended to be lawyers. Australian High Court judge and President of the International Commission of Jurists Justice Michael Kirby has noted  Mores resignation as Lord Chancellor demonstrates also a recognition of the fact that so long as he held office he was obliged to conform to the Kings law. It is often the fact that judges and lawyers must perform acts which they do not particularly like. In Utopia for example More had written that he believed capital punishment to be immoral reprehensible and unjustifiable. Yet as Lord Chancellor and as councillor to the King he certainly participated in sending hundreds of people to their death a troubling thought. Doubtless he saw himself as many judges before and since have done as a mere instrument of the legal power of the State. A 1999 poll of legal British professionals nominated More as the person who most embodies the virtues of the law needed at the close of the millenium. The virtues were Mores views on the primacy of conscience and his role in the practical establishment of the principle of equity in English secular law through the Court of Chancery. William Ropers biography of More was one of the first biographies in Modern English. Sir Thomas More is a play written circa 1592 in collaboration between Henry Chettle Anthony Munday William Shakespeare and others. In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney Master of the Revels in the government of Queen Elizabeth I. The script has since been published and has had several productions. In 1941 the 20th-century British author Elizabeth Goudge wrote a short story The Kings Servant based on the last few years of Thomas Mores life seen through his family and especially his adopted daughter Anne Cresacre More. The 20th-century agnostic playwright Robert Bolt portrayed Thomas More as the tragic hero of his 1960 play A Man for All Seasons. The title is drawn from what Robert Whittington in 1520 wrote of More More is a man of an angels wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness lowliness and affability And as time requireth a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons. In 1966 the play A Man for All Seasons was adapted into a film with the same title. It was directed by Fred Zinnemann and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars Paul Scofield a noted British actor who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was the most difficult part I played. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Scofield won the Best Actor Oscar. In 1988 Charlton Heston starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of the common man that had been cut from the 1966 film. In the 1969 film Anne of the Thousand Days More is portrayed by actor William Squire. Catholic science fiction writer R. A. Lafferty wrote his novel Past Master as a modern equivalent to Mores Utopia which he saw as a satire. In this novel Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535 where he is made king of the world Astrobe only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one. Karl Zuchardts novel Stirb du Narr about Mores struggle with King Henry portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world. In her 2009 novel Wolf Hall its 2012 sequel Bring Up the Bodies and the final book of the trilogy her 2020 The Mirror and the Light the novelist Hilary Mantel portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants and an ally of the Habsburg empire. Literary critic James Wood in his book The Broken Estate a collection of essays is critical of More and refers to him as cruel in punishment evasive in argument lusty for power and repressive in politics. Aaron S. Zelmans non-fiction book The State Versus the People includes a comparison of Utopia with Platos Republic. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a police state. Zelman comments More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the Kremlin. By this Zelman implies that Utopia influenced Vladimir Lenins Bolsheviks despite their brutal repression of religion. Other biographers such as Peter Ackroyd have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the Holy See over Christendom. The protagonist of Walker Percys novels Love in the Ruins and The Thanatos Syndrome is Dr Thomas More a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More. More is the focus of the Al Stewart song A Man For All Seasons from the 1978 album Time Passages and of the Far song Sir featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album Quick. In addition the song So Says I by indie rock outfit The Shins alludes to the socialist interpretation of Mores Utopia. Jeremy Northam depicts More in the television series The Tudors as a peaceful man as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. More is depicted by Andrew Buchan in the television series The Spanish Princess. In the years 19682007 the University of San Franciscos Gleeson Library Associates awarded the annual Sir Thomas More Medal for Book Collecting to private book collectors of note including Elmer BeltOtto Schaefer Albert Sperisen John S. Mayfield and Lord Wardington. Having been praised as a Communist hero by Karl Marx Friedrich Engels and Karl Kautsky because of the Communist attitude to property in his Utopia under Soviet Communism the name of Thomas More was in ninth position from the top of Moscows Stele of Freedom as one of the most influential thinkers who promoted the liberation of humankind from oppression arbitrariness and exploitation. This monument was erected in 1918 in Aleksandrovsky Garden near the Kremlin at Lenins suggestion. The Great Soviet Encyclopedias English translation described More as the founder of Utopian socialism the first person to describe a society in which private property ... had been abolished and a thinker who did not believe that the ideal society would be achieved through revolution but who greatly influenced reformers of subsequent centuries especially Morelly G. Babeuf Saint-Simon C. Fourier E. Cabet and other representatives of Utopian socialism. Utopia also inspired socialists such as William Morris. Many see Mores communism or socialism as purely satirical. In 1888 while praising Mores communism Karl Kautsky pointed out that perplexed historians and economists often saw the name Utopia as a subtle hint by More that he himself regarded his communism as an impracticable dream. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn the Russian Nobel Prize-winning anti-Communist author of The Gulag Archipelago argued that Soviet communism needed enslavement and forced labour to survive and that this had been ...foreseen as far back as Thomas More the great-grandfather of socialism in his Utopia. In 2008 More was portrayed on stage in Hong Kong as an allegorical symbol of the pan-democracy camp resisting the Chinese Communist Party in a translated and modified version of Robert Bolts play A Man for All Seasons. A plaque in the middle of the floor of Londons Westminster Hall commemorates Mores trial for treason and condemnation to execution in that original part of the Palace of Westminster. The building which houses Parliament would have been well known to More who served several terms as a member and became Speaker of the House of Commons before his appointment as Englands Lord Chancellor. As Mores royal duties frequently required his attendance at the kings Thames-side palaces in both Richmond and Greenwich it was convenient to select a riverside property situated between them for his home. In about 1520 he purchased a parcel of land comprising undisturbed wood and pasture stretching from the Thames in Chelsea to the present-day Kings Road. There he caused to be built a dignified red-brick mansion in which he lived until his arrest in 1534. In the bawdy poem The Twelve Mery Jestes of Wyddow Edyth written in 1525 by a member of Mores household using the pseudonym of Walter Smith the widow arrives by boat at Chelsaywhere she had best cheare of allin the house of Syr Thomas More. Upon Mores arrest the estate was confiscated coming into the possession of the Comptroller of the Royal Household William Paulet. In 1682 the property was renamed Beaufort House after 1st Duke of Beaufort a new owner. In June 1523 More bought the very large and beautiful Crosby Place in Bishopsgate London but this was not a simple transaction eight months later he sold the property at a considerable profit to his friend and business partner Antonio Bonvisi who in turn leased it back to Mores son-in-law William Roper and nephew William Rastell; possibly this was an agreed means of dealing with a debt between More and Bonvisi. Because of this the Crown did not confiscate the property after Mores execution. Across a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is Chelsea Old Church an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin including his role as peacemaker between the various Christian European states as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not however buried here nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church facing the River Thames is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969 commemorating More as saint scholar and statesman; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby on Upper Cheyne Row the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer St. Thomas More honours the martyr. A plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill London just outside the Tower of London as well as all those executed there many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. Mores corpse minus his head was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula within the walls of the Tower of London as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors. Thomas More is commemorated by a stone plaque near St Katharine Docks just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane a corruption of Knighten Guild derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour. St Dunstans Church an Anglican parish church in Canterbury possesses Mores head rescued by his daughter Margaret Roper whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel itself to the right of the churchs sanctuary or main altar. St Dunstans Church has carefully investigated preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies possibly from later interference. Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in Mores life. A small plaque marks the former home of William and Margaret Roper; another house nearby and entitled Roper House is now a home for deaf people.

Edmund Spenser,Edmund Spenser was an English poet best known for The Faerie Queene an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse and is often considered one of the greatest poets in the English language. Edmund Spenser was born in East Smithfield London around the year 1552; however there is still some ambiguity as to the exact date of his birth. His parenthood is obscure but he was probably the son of John Spenser a journeyman clothmaker. As a young boy he was educated in London at the Merchant Taylors School and matriculated as a sizar at Pembroke College Cambridge. While at Cambridge he became a friend of Gabriel Harvey and later consulted him despite their differing views on poetry. In 1578 he became for a short time secretary to John Young Bishop of Rochester. In 1579 he published The Shepheardes Calender and around the same time married his first wife Machabyas Childe. They had two children Sylvanus and Katherine. In July 1580 Spenser went to Ireland in service of the newly appointed Lord Deputy Arthur Grey 14th Baron Grey de Wilton. Spenser served under Lord Grey with Walter Raleigh at the Siege of Smerwick massacre. When Lord Grey was recalled to England Spenser stayed on in Ireland having acquired other official posts and lands in the Munster Plantation. Raleigh acquired other nearby Munster estates confiscated in the Second Desmond Rebellion. Sometime between 1587 and 1589 Spenser acquired his main estate at Kilcolman near Doneraile in North Cork. He later bought a second holding to the south at Rennie on a rock overlooking the river Blackwater in North Cork. Its ruins are still visible today. A short distance away grew a tree locally known as Spensers Oak until it was destroyed in a lightning strike in the 1960s. Local legend claims that he penned some of The Faerie Queene under this tree. In 1590 Spenser brought out the first three books of his most famous work The Faerie Queene having travelled to London to publish and promote the work with the likely assistance of Raleigh. He was successful enough to obtain a life pension of 50 a year from the Queen. He probably hoped to secure a place at court through his poetry but his next significant publication boldly antagonised the queens principal secretary Lord Burghley through its inclusion of the satirical Mother Hubberds Tale. He returned to Ireland. He was at the centre of a literary circle whose members included his lifelong friend Lodowick Bryskett and Dr. John Longe Archbishop of Armagh. In 1591 Spenser published a translation in verse of Joachim Du Bellays sonnets Les Antiquités de Rome which had been published in 1558. Spensers version Ruines of Rome by Bellay may also have been influenced by Latin poems on the same subject written by Jean or Janis Vitalis and published in 1576. By 1594 Spensers first wife had died and in that year he married a much younger Elizabeth Boyle a relative of Richard Boyle 1st Earl of Cork. He addressed to her the sonnet sequence Amoretti. The marriage itself was celebrated in Epithalamion. They had a son named Peregrine. In 1596 Spenser wrote a prose pamphlet titled A View of the Present State of Ireland. This piece in the form of a dialogue circulated in manuscript remaining unpublished until the mid-seventeenth century. It is probable that it was kept out of print during the authors lifetime because of its inflammatory content. The pamphlet argued that Ireland would never be totally pacified by the English until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed if necessary by violence. In 1598 during the Nine Years War Spenser was driven from his home by the native Irish forces of Aodh Ó Néill. His castle at Kilcolman was burned and Ben Jonson who may have had private information asserted that one of his infant children died in the blaze. In the year after being driven from his home 1599 Spenser travelled to London where he died at the age of forty-six for want of bread according to Ben Jonson; one of Jonsons more doubtful statements since Spenser had a payment to him authorised by the government and was due his pension. His coffin was carried to his grave in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey by other poets who threw many pens and pieces of poetry into his grave with many tears. His second wife survived him and remarried twice. His sister Sarah who had accompanied him to Ireland married into the Travers family and her descendants were prominent landowners in Cork for centuries. Thomas Fuller in Worthies of England included a story where the Queen told her treasurer William Cecil to pay Spenser one hundred pounds for his poetry. The treasurer however objected that the sum was too much. She said Then give him what is reason. Without receiving his payment in due time Spenser gave the Queen this quatrain on one of her progresses I was promisd on a timeTo have a reason for my rhymeFrom that time unto this seasonI receivd nor rhyme nor reason. She immediately ordered the treasurer to pay Spenser the original 100. This story seems to have attached itself to Spenser from Thomas Churchyard who apparently had difficulty in getting payment of his pension the only other pension Elizabeth awarded to a poet. Spenser seems to have had no difficulty in receiving payment when it was due as the pension was being collected for him by his publisher Ponsonby. The Shepheardes Calender is Edmund Spensers first major work which appeared in 1579. It emulates Virgils Eclogues of the first century BCE and the Eclogues of Mantuan by Baptista Mantuanus a late medieval early renaissance poet. An eclogue is a short pastoral poem that is in the form of a dialogue or soliloquy. Although all the months together form an entire year each month stands alone as a separate poem. Editions of the late 16th and early 17th centuries include woodcuts for each monthpoem and thereby have a slight similarity to an emblem book which combines a number of self-contained pictures and texts usually a short vignette saying or allegory with an accompanying illustration. Spensers masterpiece is the epic poem The Faerie Queene. The first three books of The Faerie Queene were published in 1590 and the second set of three books was published in 1596. Spenser originally indicated that he intended the poem to consist of twelve books so the version of the poem we have today is incomplete. Despite this it remains one of the longest poems in the English language. It is an allegorical work and can be read on several levels of allegory including as praise of Queen Elizabeth I. In a completely allegorical context the poem follows several knights in an examination of several virtues. In Spensers A Letter of the Authors he states that the entire epic poem is cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devises and that the aim behind The Faerie Queene was to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline. Spenser published numerous relatively short poems in the last decade of the sixteenth century almost all of which consider love or sorrow. In 1591 he published Complaints a collection of poems that express complaints in mournful or mocking tones. Four years later in 1595 Spenser published Amoretti and Epithalamion. This volume contains eighty-eight sonnets commemorating his courtship of Elizabeth Boyle. In Amoretti Spenser uses subtle humour and parody while praising his beloved reworking Petrarchism in his treatment of longing for a woman.Epithalamion similar to Amoretti deals in part with the unease in the development of a romantic and sexual relationship. It was written for his wedding to his young bride Elizabeth Boyle. Some have speculated that the attention to disquiet in general reflects Spensers personal anxieties at the time as he was unable to complete his most significant work The Faerie Queene. In the following year Spenser released Prothalamion a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke allegedly in hopes to gain favour in the court. Spenser used a distinctive verse form called the Spenserian stanza in several works including The Faerie Queene. The stanzas main metre is iambic pentameter with a final line in iambic hexameter and the rhyme scheme is ababbcbcc. He also used his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet. In a Spenserian sonnet the last line of every quatrain is linked with the first line of the next one yielding the rhyme scheme ababbcbccdcdee. Men Call you Fayre is a fine Sonnet from Amoretti. The poet presents the concept of true beauty in the poem. He addresses the sonnet to his beloved Elizabeth Boyle and presents his courtship. Like all Renaissance men Edmund Spenser believed that love is an inexhaustible source of beauty and order. In this Sonnet the poet expresses his idea of true beauty. The physical beauty will finish after a few days; it is not a permanent beauty. He emphasises beauty of mind and beauty of intellect. He considers his beloved is not simply flesh but is also a spiritual being. The poet opines that he is beloved born of heavenly seed and she is derived from fair spirit. The poet states that because of her clean mind pure heart and sharp intellect men call her fair and she deserves it. At the end the poet praises her spiritual beauty and he worships her because of her Divine Soul. Though Spenser was well-read in classical literature scholars have noted that his poetry does not rehash tradition but rather is distinctly his. This individuality may have resulted to some extent from a lack of comprehension of the classics. Spenser strove to emulate such ancient Roman poets as Virgil and Ovid whom he studied during his schooling but many of his best-known works are notably divergent from those of his predecessors. The language of his poetry is purposely archaic reminiscent of earlier works such as The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer and Il Canzoniere of Petrarch whom Spenser greatly admired. An Anglican and a devotee of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth Spenser was particularly offended by the anti-Elizabethan propaganda that some Catholics circulated. Like most Protestants near the time of the Reformation Spenser saw a Catholic church full of corruption and he determined that it was not only the wrong religion but the anti-religion. This sentiment is an important backdrop for the battles of The Faerie Queene. Spenser was called the Poets Poet by Charles Lamb and was admired by John Milton William Blake William Wordsworth John Keats Lord Byron Alfred Tennyson and others. Among his contemporaries Walter Raleigh wrote a commendatory poem to The Faerie Queene in 1590 in which he claims to admire and value Spensers work more so than any other in the English language. John Milton in his Areopagitica mentions our sage and serious poet Spenser whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas. In the eighteenth century Alexander Pope compared Spenser to a mistress whose faults we see but love her with them all. In his work A View of the Present State of Irelande Spenser discussed future plans to establish control over Ireland the most recent Irish uprising led by Hugh ONeill having demonstrated the futility of previous efforts. The work is partly a defence of Lord Arthur Grey de Wilton who was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1580 and who greatly influenced Spensers thinking on Ireland. The goal of the piece was to show that Ireland was in great need of reform. Spenser believed that Ireland is a diseased portion of the State it must first be cured and reformed before it could be in a position to appreciate the good sound laws and blessings of the nation. In A View of the Present State of Ireland Spenser categorises the evils of the Irish people into three prominent categories laws customs and religion. According to Spenser these three elements worked together in creating the supposedly disruptive and degraded people who inhabited the country. One example given in the work is the Irish law system termed Brehon law which at the time trumped the established law as dictated by the Crown. The Brehon system had its own court and methods of punishing infractions committed. Spenser viewed this system as a backward custom which contributed to the degradation of the Irish people. A particular legal punishment viewed with distaste by Spenser was the Brehon method of dealing with murder which was to impose an éraic on the murderers family. From Spensers viewpoint the appropriate punishment for murder was capital punishment. Spenser also warned of the dangers that allowing the education of children in the Irish language would bring Soe that the speach being Irish the hart must needes be Irishe; for out of the aboundance of the hart the tonge speaketh. He pressed for a scorched earth policy in Ireland noting its effectiveness in the Second Desmond Rebellion Washington University in St. Louis professor Joseph Lowenstein with the assistance of several undergraduate students has been involved in creating editing and annotating a digital archive of the first publication of poet Edmund Spensers collective works in 100 years. A large grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities has been given to support this ambitious project centralized at Washington University with support from other colleges in the United States.
Walter Raleigh,Sir Walter Raleigh was an English statesman soldier writer and explorer. One of the most notable figures of the Elizabethan era he played a leading part in English colonisation of North America suppressed rebellion in Ireland helped defend England against the Spanish Armada and held political positions under Elizabeth I. Raleigh was born to a landed gentry family of Protestant faith in Devon the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. He was the younger half-brother of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and a cousin of Sir Richard Grenville. Little is known of his early life though in his late teens he spent some time in France taking part in the religious civil wars. In his 20s he took part in the suppression of rebellion in the colonisation of Ireland; he also participated in the siege of Smerwick. Later he became a landlord of property in Ireland and mayor of Youghal in East Munster where his house still stands in Myrtle Grove. He rose rapidly in the favour of Queen Elizabeth I and was knighted in 1585. He was granted a royal patent to explore Virginia paving the way for future English settlements. In 1591 he secretly married Elizabeth Throckmorton one of the Queens ladies-in-waiting without the Queens permission for which he and his wife were sent to the Tower of London. After his release they retired to his estate at Sherborne Dorset. In 1594 Raleigh heard of a City of Gold in South America and sailed to find it publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of El Dorado. After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603 Raleigh was again imprisoned in the Tower this time for being involved in the Main Plot against King James I who was not favourably disposed towards him. In 1616 he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado. During the expedition men led by his top commander ransacked a Spanish outpost in violation of both the terms of his pardon and the 1604 peace treaty with Spain. Raleigh returned to England and to appease the Spanish he was arrested and executed in 1618. Little is known about Sir Walter Raleighs birth but he is believed to have been born on 22 January 1552 . He grew up in the house of Hayes Barton in East Devon. He was the youngest of the five sons of Walter Raleigh of Fardel Manor in South Devon. Raleighs family is generally assumed to have been a junior branch of the Raleigh family 11th-century lords of the manor of Raleigh Pilton in North Devon although the two branches are known to have borne entirely dissimilar coats of arms adopted at the start of the age of heraldry . His mother was Katherine Champernowne the third wife of Walter Raleigh senior. She was the fourth daughter of Sir Philip Champernowne lord of the manor of Modbury Devon by his wife Catherine Carew a daughter of Sir Edmund Carew of Mohuns Ottery Devon. Katherine was the widow of Otes Gilbert of Greenway and of Compton Castle both in Devon.  Katherine Champernownes paternal aunt was Kat Ashley governess of Queen Elizabeth I who introduced Raleigh and his brothers to the court. Raleighs maternal uncle was Sir Arthur Champernowne a Member of Parliament Sheriff of Devon and Admiral of the West.  Walter Raleigh juniors immediate family included his full brother Carew Raleigh and half-brothers John Gilbert Humphrey Gilbert and Adrian Gilbert. As a consequence of their kinship with the Champernowne family all of the Raleigh and Gilbert brothers became prominent during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Raleighs family was highly Protestant in religious orientation and had a number of near escapes during the reign of Roman Catholic Queen Mary I of England. In the most notable of these his father had to hide in a tower to avoid execution. As a result Raleigh developed a hatred of Roman Catholicism during his childhood and proved himself quick to express it after Protestant Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. In matters of religion Elizabeth was more moderate than her half-sister Mary. In 1569 Raleigh went to France to serve with the Huguenots in the French religious civil wars. In 1572 Raleigh was registered as an undergraduate at Oriel College Oxford but he left in 1574 without a degree. Raleigh proceeded to finish his education in the Inns of Court. In 1575 he was admitted to the Middle Temple having previously been a member of Lyons Inn one of the Inns of Chancery. At his trial in 1603 he stated that he had never studied law. Much of his life is uncertain between 1569 and 1575 but in his History of the World he claimed to have been an eyewitness at the Battle of Moncontour in France. In 1575 or 1576 Raleigh returned to England. In 1577 and again in 1579 Raleigh made voyages with his half-brother Sir Humphrey Gilbert in attempts to find a Northwest Passage. They failed to find a passage but succeeded in raiding Spanish ships. From 1579 to late 1580 Raleigh took part in the suppression of the Desmond Rebellions. He was present at the siege of Smerwick where he led the party that beheaded some 600 Spanish and Italian soldiers. In September 1584 Queen Elizabeth I had the land surveyed to be divided amongst her Undertakers to colonize. In 1585 Raleigh received 40000 acres in the Munster Plantation including the coastal walled town of Youghal and further up the Blackwater River the village of Lismore. Raleigh made the town of Youghal in Ireland his occasional home during his 17 years as an Irish landlord frequently being domiciled at Killua Castle Clonmellon County Westmeath. He was mayor there from 1588 to 1589. Raleigh had veterans of the earlier attempts of the Roanoke Colony eventually settle in Ireland to include Thomas Hariot and John White from the 1585 trip. Raleigh is credited with bringing potatoes back to England and Ireland. Potatoes would later play a big role in Irish farming and culture. A potato failure much later in the 1800s would lead to the Great Famine.  Amongst Raleighs acquaintances in Munster was another Englishman who had been granted land in the Irish colonies poet Edmund Spenser. Raleighs management of his Irish estates ran into difficulties which contributed to a decline in his fortunes. In 1602 he sold the lands to Richard Boyle 1st Earl of Cork who subsequently prospered under kings James I and Charles I. On March 25 1584 Queen Elizabeth granted Raleigh a royal charter authorising him to explore colonise and rule any remote heathen and barbarous lands countries and territories not actually possessed of any Christian Prince or inhabited by Christian People in return for one-fifth of all the gold and silver that might be mined there. This charter specified that Raleigh had seven years in which to establish a settlement or else lose his right to do so. Raleigh and Elizabeth intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World and a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain. The charter was originally given to Sir Humphrey Gilbert who pitched the idea to Queen Elizabeth I and died at sea while attempting to accomplish it. On April 27 1584 the Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe expedition set sail from England on an exploratory mission to determine what resources were available in North America. They returned with two of the local inhabitants Manteo and Wanchese in August 1584 and reported of their findings. The region received the name Virginia for the Virgin Queen Elizabeth I which is the origin of the name of the modern day state. In 1585 he sent a militarized group to North America to set up a fort to raid Spanish ships and become the first English colony in North America. The voyage was led by Sir Richard Grenville and the colony on Roanoke Island was governed by Ralph Lane. The colony ran out of food after clashes with the local inhabitants and eventually left with Sir Francis Drake in June 1586 after resupply attempts failed. Sir Richard Grenvile arrived shortly after the Lane colony left with Drake. He left supplies and 15 men on Roanoke Island and returned to England. They were never seen again.  On July 22 1587 Raleigh attempted a second expedition again establishing a settlement on Roanoke Island. This time a more diverse group of settlers was sent including some entire families under the governance of John White. After a short while in America White returned to England to obtain more supplies for the colony planning to return in a year. Unfortunately for the colonists at Roanoke one year became three. The first delay came when Queen Elizabeth I ordered all vessels to remain at port for potential use against the Spanish Armada. After Englands 1588 victory over the Spanish Armada the ships were given permission to sail. The second delay came after Whites small fleet set sail for Roanoke and his crew insisted on sailing first towards Cuba in hopes of capturing treasure-laden Spanish merchant ships. Enormous riches described by their pilot an experienced Portuguese navigator hired by Raleigh outweighed Whites objections to the delay. When the supply ship arrived in Roanoke three years later than planned the colonists had disappeared. The only clue to their fate was the word CROATOAN and the letters CRO carved into tree trunks. White had arranged with the settlers that if they should move the name of their destination be carved into a tree or corner post. This suggested the possibility that they had moved to Croatoan Island but a hurricane prevented John White from investigating the island for survivors. Other speculation includes their having starved or been swept away or lost at sea during the stormy weather of 1588. No further attempts at contact were recorded for some years. Whatever the fate of the settlers the settlement is now remembered as the Roanoke Colony later known as the Lost Colony. Raleigh himself never visited North America although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to the Orinoco river basin in South America in search of the golden city of El Dorado. These expeditions were funded primarily by Raleigh and his friends but never provided the steady stream of revenue necessary to maintain a colony in America. In 1580 Raleigh went to fight in Ireland against the 2nd Desmond Rebellion. In December 1581 he returned to England. He took part in court life and became a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I because of his efforts at increasing the Protestant Church in Ireland. In 1585 Raleigh was knighted and was appointed warden of the stannaries that is of the tin mines of Cornwall and Devon Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall and vice-admiral of the two counties. He was a member of parliament for Devonshire in 1585 and 1586. He was also granted the right to colonise America. Raleigh commissioned shipbuilder R. Chapman of Deptford to build a ship for him. She was originally called Ark but became Ark Raleigh following the convention at the time by which the ship bore the name of her owner. The Crown purchased the ship from Raleigh in January 1587 for 5000 . This took the form of a reduction in the sum that Sir Walter owed the queen; he received Exchequer tallies but no money. As a result the ship was renamed Ark Royal. In 1586 one of Raleighs expeditions caught Spanish explorer Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa. Raleigh held Gamboa prisoner in his house and had long conversations with him. Gamboa passed messages to the Spanish ambassador who forwarded them to King Philip II. Raleigh wanted to defect to Spain and sell his ship the Ark. Philip refused to buy the ship but encouraged the passing of information from Raleigh.  In 1588 Raleigh had some involvement with defence against the Spanish Armada at Devon. The ship that he had built offered to sell to Spain and later sold to the crown the Ark Royal was Lord High Admiral Howards flagship. In 1592 Raleigh was given many rewards by the Queen including Durham House in the Strand and the estate of Sherborne Dorset. He was appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. However he had not been given any of the great offices of state. In 1591 Raleigh secretly married Elizabeth Bess Throckmorton . She was one of the Queens ladies-in-waiting 11 years his junior and was pregnant at the time. She gave birth to a son believed to be named Damerei who was given to a wet nurse at Durham House and died of plague in October 1592. Bess resumed her duties to the queen. The following year the unauthorised marriage was discovered and the Queen ordered Raleigh to be imprisoned and Bess dismissed from court. Both were imprisoned in the Tower of London in June 1592. He was released from prison in August 1592 to manage a recently returned expedition and attack on the Spanish coast. The fleet was recalled by the Queen but not before it captured an incredibly rich prizea merchant ship named Madre de Deus off Flores. Raleigh was sent to organise and divide the spoils of the ship. He was sent back to the Tower but by early 1593 had been released and become a member of Parliament. It was several years before Raleigh returned to favour and he travelled extensively in this time. Raleigh and his wife remained devoted to each other. They had two more sons Walter in 1593 and Carew in 1605. Raleigh was elected a burgess of Mitchell Cornwall in the parliament of 1593. He retired to his estate at Sherborne where he built a new house completed in 1594 known then as Sherborne Lodge. Since extended it is now known as Sherborne New Castle. He made friends with the local gentry such as Sir Ralph Horsey of Clifton Maybank and Charles Thynne of Longleat. During this period at a dinner party at Horseys Raleigh had a heated discussion about religion with Reverend Ralph Ironsides. The argument later gave rise to charges of atheism against Raleigh though the charges were dismissed. He was elected to Parliament speaking on religious and naval matters. In 1594 he came into possession of a Spanish account of a great golden city at the headwaters of the Caroní River. A year later he explored what is now Guyana and eastern Venezuela in search of Lake Parime and Manoa the legendary city. Once back in England he published The Discovery of Guiana an account of his voyage which made exaggerated claims as to what had been discovered. The book can be seen as a contribution to the El Dorado legend. Venezuela has gold deposits but no evidence indicates that Raleigh found any mines. He is sometimes said to have discovered Angel Falls but these claims are considered far-fetched. In 1596 Raleigh took part in the capture of Cádiz where he was wounded. He also served as the rear admiral of the Islands Voyage to the Azores in 1597. On his return from the Azores Raleigh helped England defend itself against the major threat of the 3rd Spanish Armada during the autumn of 1597. The Armada was dispersed in the Channel and later was devastated by a storm off Ireland. Lord Howard of Effingham and Raleigh were able to organise a fleet that resulted in the capture of a Spanish ship in retreat carrying vital information regarding the Spanish plans. In 1597 Raleigh was chosen as member of parliament for Dorset and in 1601 for Cornwall. He was unique in the Elizabethan period in sitting for three counties. From 1600 to 1603 as governor of the Channel Island of Jersey Raleigh modernised its defences. This included the construction of a new fort protecting the approaches to Saint Helier Fort Isabella Bellissima or Elizabeth Castle. Royal favour with Queen Elizabeth had been restored by this time but his good fortune did not last; the Queen died on 24 March 1603. Raleigh was arrested on 19 July 1603 at what is now the Old Exeter Inn in Ashburton charged with treason for his involvement in the Main Plot against Elizabeths successor James I and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Raleighs trial began on 17 November in the converted Great Hall of Winchester Castle. Raleigh conducted his own defence. The chief evidence against him was the signed and sworn confession of his friend Henry Brooke 11th Baron Cobham. Raleigh repeatedly requested that Cobham be called to testify. my acuser come face to face and be deposed. Were the case but for a small copyhold you would have witnesses or good proof to lead the jury to a verdict; and I am here for my life Raleigh argued that the evidence against him was hearsay but the tribunal refused to allow Cobham to testify and be cross-examined. Raleighs trial has been regularly cited as influential in establishing a common law right to confront accusers in court. Raleigh was convicted but King James spared his life. While imprisoned in the Tower Raleigh wrote his incomplete The Historie of the World. Using a wide array of sources in six languages Raleigh was fully abreast of the latest continental scholarship. He wrote not about England but of the ancient world with a heavy emphasis on geography. Despite his intention of providing current advice to the King of England King James I complained that it was too sawcie in censuring Princes. Raleigh remained imprisoned in the Tower until 1616. His son Carew was conceived and born while Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower. In 1617 Raleigh was pardoned by the King and granted permission to conduct a second expedition to Venezuela in search of El Dorado. During the expedition a detachment of Raleighs men under the command of his long-time friend Lawrence Kemys attacked the Spanish outpost of Santo Tomé de Guayana on the Orinoco river in violation of peace treaties with Spain and against Raleighs orders. A condition of Raleighs pardon was avoidance of any hostility against Spanish colonies or shipping. In the initial attack on the settlement Raleighs son Walter was fatally shot. Kemys informed Raleigh of his sons death and begged for forgiveness but did not receive it and at once committed suicide. On Raleighs return to England an outraged Count Gondomar the Spanish ambassador demanded that Raleighs death sentence be reinstated by King James who had little choice but to do so. Raleigh was brought to London from Plymouth by Sir Lewis Stukley where he passed up numerous opportunities to make an effective escape. Raleigh was beheaded in the Old Palace Yard at the Palace of Westminster on 29 October 1618. Let us dispatch he said to his executioner. At this hour my ague comes upon me. I would not have my enemies think I quaked from fear. After he was allowed to see the axe that would be used to behead him he mused This is a sharp Medicine but it is a Physician for all diseases and miseries. According to biographers Raleighs last words spoken to the hesitating executioner were What dost thou fear Strike man strike Thomas Hariot may have introduced him to tobacco. Having been one of the people to popularise tobacco smoking in England he left a small tobacco pouch found in his cell shortly after his execution. Engraved upon the pouch was a Latin inscription Comes meus fuit in illo miserrimo tempore . Raleighs head was embalmed and presented to his wife. His body was to be buried in the local church in Beddington Surrey the home of Lady Raleigh but was finally laid to rest in St. Margarets Westminster where his tomb is presently located. The Lords she wrote have given me his dead body though they have denied me his life. God hold me in my wits. It has been said that Lady Raleigh kept her husbands head in a velvet bag until her death. After Raleighs wifes death 29 years later his head was removed to his tomb and interred at St. Margarets Church. Although Raleighs popularity had waned considerably since his Elizabethan heyday his execution was seen by many both at the time and since as unnecessary and unjust as for many years his involvement in the Main Plot seemed to have been limited to a meeting with Lord Cobham. One of the judges at his trial later said The justice of England has never been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of the honourable Sir Walter Raleigh. Raleighs poetry is written in the relatively straightforward unornamented mode known as the plain style. C. S. Lewis considered Raleigh one of the eras silver poets a group of writers who resisted the Italian Renaissance influence of dense classical reference and elaborate poetic devices. His writing contains strong personal treatments of themes such as love loss beauty and time. Most of his poems are short lyrics that were inspired by actual events. In poems such as What is Our Life and The Lie Raleigh expresses a contemptus mundi attitude more characteristic of the Middle Ages than of the dawning era of humanistic optimism. But his lesser-known long poem The Oceans Love to Cynthia combines this vein with the more elaborate conceits associated with his contemporaries Edmund Spenser and John Donne expressing a melancholy sense of history. The poem was written during his imprisonment in the Tower of London. Raleigh wrote a poetic response to Christopher Marlowes The Passionate Shepherd to His Love of 1592 entitled The Nymphs Reply to the Shepherd. Both were written in the style of traditional pastoral poetry and follow the structure of six four-line stanzas employing a rhyme scheme of AABB with Raleighs an almost line-for-line refutation of Marlowes sentiments. Years later the 20th-century poet William Carlos Williams would join the poetic argument with his Raleigh Was Right. All finished and some unfinished poems written by Raleigh or plausibly attributed to him In 1845 Shakespeare scholar Delia Bacon first proposed that a group of authors had actually written the plays later attributed to William Shakespeare the main writer being Walter Raleigh. Later George S. Caldwell asserted that Raleigh was actually the sole author. These claims have been supported by other scholars throughout subsequent years including Albert J. Beveridge and Henry Pemberton but are rejected by the majority of Shakespearean scholars today. In 2002 Raleigh was featured in the BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. A galliard was composed in honour of Raleigh by either Francis Cutting or Richard Allison. The state capital of North Carolina its second-largest city was named Raleigh in 1792 after Sir Walter sponsor of the Roanoke Colony. In the city a bronze statue which has been moved around different locations within the city was cast in honour of the citys namesake. The Lost Colony is commemorated at the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site on Roanoke Island North Carolina. Mount Raleigh in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains in British Columbia Canada was named for him with related features the Raleigh Glacier and Raleigh Creek named in association with the mountain. Mount Gilbert just to Mount Raleighs south was named for his half-brother Sir Humphrey. Raleigh has been widely speculated to be responsible for introducing the potato to Europe and was a key figure in bringing it to Ireland. However modern historians dispute this claim suggesting it would have been impossible for Raleigh to have discovered the potato in the places he visited. Due to Raleighs role in the popularisation of smoking John Lennon humorously referred to him as such a stupid git in the song Im So Tired on the White Album The Beatles . Various colourful stories are told about him such as laying his cloak over a puddle for the Queen but they are probably apocryphal. The story of Raleighs trial is included in John George Phillimores 1850 book The History and Principles of Evidence and his commentary on the story is included in many law school textbooks on evidence in common law countries. The author George Garretts historical fiction novel Death of the Fox explores Raleighs relationships with Elizabeth I and her successor James I. Many people claim descent from Sir Walter Raleigh but nearly all have no basis in fact. The only authentic lines of descent are as follows Raleighs only surviving child Carew Raleigh had three surviving childrenWalter Anne and Philip . The elder son Walter Raleigh was knighted in June 1660 but died two months later. He was buried at West Horsley. He left three surviving childrenElizabeth Philippa and Anne. Philippa and Anne left descendants. It was Philippa Weekes daughter Elizabeth Elwes who seems to have owned the main store of Raleigh memorabilia and was consulted by William Oldys in 1735 when he was writing his Life of Raleigh  Anne Raleigh married Sir Peter Tyrrell of Castlethorpe Bucks. She left two daughters - Christobella who married as her third husband Richard Fiennes 6th Viscount Saye Sele but died without surviving issue in 1789. The younger daughter Harriet married Francis Mann of Kidlington Oxfordshire and died in 1785 having had a daughter Harriet who married Capt. Joseph Mead and died in 1784 leaving issue.  Philip Raleigh championed his grandfathers cause publishing several of his hitherto unpublished papers. He had a family of four sons and three daughters. The youngest son Carew Raleigh page of honour to William III was serving as a captains servant on HMSBredah when he died of fever in the West Indies in 1697 aged seventeen. The second son Lieut. Brudenell Raleigh was also serving in the navy in the West Indies when he died of fever in June 1698 aged 22. The eldest son Captain Walter Raleigh Grenadier Guards was page of honour to Queen Mary and was killed at the siege of Schellenberg in 1704 aged 31. He was unmarried. After Walters death his father was granted a pension by the crown in consideration of his 3 sons being slain in the late and present war. The third son Captain-Lieutenant Grenville Raleigh served in the Duke of Marlboroughs army throughout the War of the Spanish Succession and died of fever in 1717 while guarding the prisoners at Chester after the 1715 Jacobite rising. He had married and had two sons and a daughter Mary. On the death of his daughter in Bath in 1783 it was noted that she was the only surviving descendant in the direct line of Sir Walter Raleigh.  Of Philip Raleighs daughters Anne and Elizabeth both died unmarried. The eldest daughter Frances married William Honywood eldest son of Sir William Honywood of Evington Place Elmsted Kent and died in 1730. Her many descendants include the present Lord Mountbatten and the actor Hugh Grant.
Philip Sidney,Sir Philip Sidney was an English poet courtier scholar and soldier who is remembered as one of the most prominent figures of the Elizabethan age. His works include a sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella a treatise The Defence of Poesy and a pastoral romance The Countess of Pembrokes Arcadia. Born at Penshurst Place Kent of an aristocratic family he was educated at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church Oxford. He was the eldest son of Sir Henry Sidney and Lady Mary Dudley. His mother was the eldest daughter of John Dudley 1st Duke of Northumberland and the sister of Robert Dudley 1st Earl of Leicester.His sister Mary was a writer translator and literary patron and married Henry Herbert 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Sidney dedicated his longest work the Arcadia to her. After her brothers death Mary reworked the Arcadia which became known as The Countess of Pembrokes Arcadia.His brother Robert Sidney was a statesman and patron of the arts and was created Earl of Leicester in 1618. In 1572 at the age of 18 he travelled to France as part of the embassy to negotiate a marriage between Elizabeth I and the Duc DAlençon. He spent the next several years in mainland Europe moving through Germany Italy Poland the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria. On these travels he met a number of prominent European intellectuals and politicians. Returning to England in 1575 Sidney met Penelope Devereux . Although much younger she inspired his famous sonnet sequence of the 1580s Astrophel and Stella. Her father Walter Devereux 1st Earl of Essex was said to have planned to marry his daughter to Sidney but Walter died in 1576 and this did not occur. In England Sidney occupied himself with politics and art. He defended his fathers administration of Ireland in a lengthy document. More seriously he quarrelled with Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford probably because of Sidneys opposition to the French marriage of Elizabeth to the much younger Alençon which de Vere championed. In the aftermath of this episode Sidney challenged de Vere to a duel which Elizabeth forbade. He then wrote a lengthy letter to the Queen detailing the foolishness of the French marriage. Characteristically Elizabeth bristled at his presumption and Sidney prudently retired from court. During a 1577 diplomatic visit to Prague Sidney secretly visited the exiled Jesuit priest Edmund Campion. Sidney had returned to court by the middle of 1581. In the latter year he was elected to fill vacant seats in the Parliament of England for both Ludlow and Shrewsbury choosing to sit for the latter and in 1584 was MP for Kent. That same year Penelope Devereux was married apparently against her will to Lord Rich. Sidney was knighted in 1583. An early arrangement to marry Anne Cecil daughter of Sir William Cecil and eventual wife of de Vere had fallen through in 1571. In 1583 he married Frances the 16-year-old daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham. In the same year he made a visit to Oxford University with Giordano Bruno the polymath known for his cosmological theories who subsequently dedicated two books to Sidney. In 1585 the couple had one daughter Elizabeth who later married Roger Manners 5th Earl of Rutland in March 1599 and died without issue in 1612.  Like the best of the Elizabethans Sidney was successful in more than one branch of literature but none of his work was published during his lifetime. His finest achievement was a sequence of 108 love sonnets. These owe much to Petrarch and Pierre de Ronsard in tone and style and place Sidney as the greatest Elizabethan sonneteer after Shakespeare. Written to his mistress Lady Penelope Rich though dedicated to his wife they reveal true lyric emotion couched in a language delicately archaic. In form Sidney usually adopts the Petrarchan octave with variations in the sestet that include the English final couplet. His artistic contacts were more peaceful and significant for his lasting fame. During his absence from court he wrote Astrophel and Stella and the first draft of The Arcadia and The Defence of Poesy. His pastoral romance The Arcadia is an intricate love story embodying the ideals of the medieval chivalry so congenial to Sidneys own spirit. The story is diffused and involved and the many secondary love stories interwoven with the main one distract attention. The characters are vague and idealized. The style in its strength and its weaknesses is that of a poet writing prose; melodious picturesque rather artificial and ornamental. The story contains a number of fine lyrics. Somewhat earlier he had met Edmund Spenser who dedicated The Shepheardes Calender to him. Other literary contacts included membership along with his friends and fellow poets Fulke Greville Edward Dyer Edmund Spenser and Gabriel Harvey of the Areopagus a humanist endeavour to classicise English verse. Sidney played a brilliant part in the militaryliterarycourtly life common to the young nobles of the time. Both his family heritage and his personal experience confirmed him as a keenly militant Protestant. In the 1570s he persuaded John Casimir to consider proposals for a united Protestant effort against the Catholic Church and Spain. In the winter of 1575-76 he fought in Ireland while his father was Lord Deputy there. In the early 1580s he argued fruitlessly for an assault on Spain itself. Promoted General of Horse in 1583 his enthusiasm for the Protestant struggle was given free rein when he was appointed governor of Flushing in the Netherlands in 1585. Whilst in the Netherlands he consistently urged boldness on his superior his uncle the Earl of Leicester. He carried out a successful raid on Spanish forces near Axel in July 1586. Later that year he joined Sir John Norris in the Battle of Zutphen fighting for the Protestant cause against the Spanish. During the battle he was shot in the thigh and died of gangrene 26 days later at the age of 31. One account says this death was avoidable and heroic. Sidney noticed that one of his men was not fully armoured. He took off his thigh armour on the grounds that it would be wrong to be better armored than his men. As he lay dying Sidney composed a song to be sung by his deathbed. According to the story while lying wounded he gave his water to another wounded soldier saying Thy necessity is yet greater than mine. This became possibly the most famous story about Sir Philip intended to illustrate his noble and gallant character. It also inspired evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith to formulate a problem in signalling theory which is known as the Sir Philip Sidney game. Sidneys body was returned to London and interred in Old St Pauls Cathedral on 16 February 1587. The grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. A modern monument in the crypt lists his among the important graves lost. Already during his own lifetime but even more after his death he had become for many English people the very epitome of a Castiglione courtier learned and politic but at the same time generous brave and impulsive. The funeral procession was one of the most elaborate ever staged so much so that his father-in-law Francis Walsingham almost went bankrupt. As Sidney was a brother of the Worshipful Company of Grocers the procession included 120 of his company brethren. Never more than a marginal figure in the politics of his time he was memorialised as the flower of English manhood in Edmund Spensers Astrophel one of the greatest English Renaissance elegies. An early biography of Sidney was written by his friend and schoolfellow Fulke Greville. While Sidney was traditionally depicted as a staunch and unwavering Protestant recent biographers such as Katherine Duncan-Jones have suggested that his religious loyalties were more ambiguous. He was known to be friendly and sympathetic towards individual Catholics. A memorial erected in 1986 at the location in Zutphen where he was mortally wounded by the Spanish can be found at the entrance of a footpath located in front of the petrol station at the Warnsveldseweg 170. In Arnhem in front of the house in the Bakkerstraat 68 an inscription on the ground reads IN THIS HOUSE DIED ON THE 17 OCTOBER 1586 SIR PHILIP SIDNEY ENGLISH POET DIPLOMAT AND SOLDIER FROM HIS WOUNDS SUFFERED AT THE BATTLE OF ZUTPHEN. HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR OUR FREEDOM. The inscription was unveiled on 17 October 2011 exactly 425 years after his death in the presence of Philip Sidney 2nd Viscount De LIsle a descendant of the brother of Philip Sidney. The city of Sidney Ohio in the United States and a street in Zutphen Netherlands have been named after Sir Philip. A statue of him can be found in the park at the Coehoornsingel where in the harsh winter of 1795 English and Hanoverian soldiers were buried who had died while retreating from advancing French troops. Another statue of Sidney by Arthur George Walker forms the centrepiece of the Old Salopians Memorial at Shrewsbury School to alumni who died serving in World War I . In the Monty Pythons Flying Circus sketches Tudor Jobs Agency Pornographic Bookshop and Elizabethan Pornography Smugglers Superintendent Gaskell a vice squad policeman is transported back to the Elizabethan age and assumes Sir Philip Sidneys identity. An epitaph of Sir Philip Sidney England has his body for she it fed;Netherlands his blood in her defence shed;The Heavens have his soulThe Arts have his fameThe soldier his griefThe world his good name.
Christopher Marlowe,Christopher Marlowe also known as Kit Marlowe was an English playwright poet and translator of the Elizabethan era. Marlowe is among the most famous of the Elizabethan playwrights. Based upon the many imitations of his play Tamburlaine modern scholars consider him to have been the foremost dramatist in London in the years just before his mysterious early death. Some scholars also believe that he greatly influenced William Shakespeare who was baptised in the same year as Marlowe and later succeeded him as the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright. Marlowe was the first to achieve critical reputation for his use of blank verse which became the standard for the era. His plays are distinguished by their overreaching protagonists. Themes found within Marlowes literary works have been noted as humanistic with realistic emotions which some scholars find difficult to reconcile with Marlowes anti-intellectualism and his catering to the prurient tastes of his Elizabethan audiences for generous displays of extreme physical violence cruelty and bloodshed. Events in Marlowes life were sometimes as extreme as those found in his plays. Differing sensational reports of Marlowes death in 1593 abounded after the event and are contested by scholars today owing to a lack of good documentation. There have been many conjectures as to the nature and reason for his death including a vicious bar-room fight blasphemous libel against the church homosexual intrigue betrayal by another playwright and espionage from the highest level the Privy Council of Elizabeth I. An official coroners account of Marlowes death was discovered only in 1925 and it did little to persuade all scholars that it told the whole story nor did it eliminate the uncertainties present in his biography. Christopher Marlowe the second of nine children and oldest child after the death of his sister Mary in 1568 was born to Canterbury shoemaker John Marlowe and his wife Katherine daughter of William Arthur of Dover. He was baptised at St Georges Church Canterbury on 26 February 1564 . Marlowes birth was likely to have been a few days before making him about two months older than William Shakespeare who was baptised on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. By age 14 Marlowe was a pupil at The Kings School Canterbury on a scholarship and two years later a student at Corpus Christi College Cambridge where he also studied through a scholarship with expectation that he would become an Anglican clergyman. Instead he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1584. Marlowe mastered Latin during his schooling reading and translating the works of Ovid. In 1587 the university hesitated to award his Master of Arts degree because of a rumour that he intended to go to the English seminary at Rheims in northern France presumably to prepare for ordination as a Roman Catholic priest. If true such an action on his part would have been a direct violation of royal edict issued by Queen Elizabeth I in 1585 criminalising any attempt by an English citizen to be ordained in the Roman Catholic Church. Large-scale violence between Protestants and Catholics on the European continent has been cited by scholars as the impetus for the Protestant English Queens defensive anti-Catholic laws issued from 1581 until her death in 1603. Despite the dire implications for Marlowe his degree was awarded on schedule when the Privy Council intervened on his behalf commending him for his faithful dealing and good service to the Queen. The nature of Marlowes service was not specified by the council but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation by modern scholars notably the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent for Privy Council member Sir Francis Walsingham. The only surviving evidence of the Privy Councils correspondence is found in their minutes the letter being lost. There is no mention of espionage in the minutes but its summation of the lost Privy Council letter is vague in meaning stating that it was not Her Majesties pleasure that persons employed as Marlowe had been in matters touching the benefit of his country should be defamed by those who are ignorant in thaffaires he went about. Scholars agree the vague wording was typically used to protect government agents but they continue to debate what the matters touching the benefit of his country actually were in Marlowes case and how they affected the 23-year-old writer as he launched his literary career in 1587. Little is known about Marlowes adult life. All available evidence other than what can be deduced from his literary works is found in legal records and other official documents. Writers of fiction and non-fiction have speculated about his professional activities private life and character. Marlowe has been described as a spy a brawler and a heretic as well as a magician duellist tobacco-user counterfeiter and rakehell. While J. A. Downie and Constance Kuriyama have argued against the more lurid speculations it is the usually circumspect J. B. Steane who remarked it seems absurd to dismiss all of these Elizabethan rumours and accusations as the Marlowe myth. Much has been written on his brief adult life including speculation of his involvement in royally-sanctioned espionage; his vocal declaration as an atheist; his sexual interests; and the puzzling circumstances surrounding his death. Marlowe is alleged to have been a government spy.Park Honan and Charles Nicholl speculate that this was the case and suggest that Marlowes recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge. In 1587 when the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree as Master of Arts it denied rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified affaires on matters touching the benefit of his country. Surviving college records from the period also indicate that in the academic year 15841585 Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university which violated university regulations. Surviving college buttery accounts which record student purchases for personal provisions show that Marlowe began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance; the amount was more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income. It has been speculated that Marlowe was the Morley who was tutor to Arbella Stuart in 1589. This possibility was first raised in a Times Literary Supplement letter by E. St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to Notes and Queries John Baker has added that only Marlowe could have been Arbellas tutor owing to the absence of any other known Morley from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied. If Marlowe was Arbellas tutor it might indicate that he was there as a spy since Arbella niece of Mary Queen of Scots and cousin of James VI of Scotland later James I of England was at the time a strong candidate for the succession to Elizabeths throne.Frederick S. Boas dismisses the possibility of this identification based on surviving legal records which document Marlowes residence in London between September and December 1589. Marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and the poet Thomas Watson in Norton Folgate and was held in Newgate Prison for a fortnight. In fact the quarrel and his arrest occurred on 18 September he was released on bail on 1 October and he had to attend court where he was acquitted on 3 December but there is no record of where he was for the intervening two months. In 1592 Marlowe was arrested in the English garrison town of Flushing in the Netherlands for alleged involvement in the counterfeiting of coins presumably related to the activities of seditious Catholics. He was sent to the Lord Treasurer but no charge or imprisonment resulted. This arrest may have disrupted another of Marlowes spying missions perhaps by giving the resulting coinage to the Catholic cause. He was to infiltrate the followers of the active Catholic plotter William Stanley and report back to Burghley. Marlowe was reputed to be an atheist which held the dangerous implication of being an enemy of God and the state by association. With the rise of public fears concerning The School of Night or School of Atheism in the late 16th century accusations of atheism were closely associated with disloyalty to the Protestant monarchy of England. Some modern historians consider that Marlowes professed atheism as with his supposed Catholicism may have been no more than a sham to further his work as a government spy. Contemporary evidence comes from Marlowes accuser in Flushing an informer called Richard Baines. The governor of Flushing had reported that each of the men had of malice accused the other of instigating the counterfeiting and of intending to go over to the Catholic enemy; such an action was considered atheistic by the Church of England. Following Marlowes arrest in 1593 Baines submitted to the authorities a note containing the opinion of one Christopher Marly concerning his damnable judgment of religion and scorn of Gods word. Baines attributes to Marlowe a total of eighteen items which scoff at the pretensions of the Old and New Testament such as Christ was a bastard and his mother dishonest the woman of Samaria and her sister were whores and that Christ knew them dishonestly St John the Evangelist was bedfellow to Christ and leaned always in his bosom and that he used him as the sinners of Sodom. He also implied that Marlowe had Catholic sympathies. Other passages are merely sceptical in tone he persuades men to atheism willing them not to be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins. The final paragraph of Bainess document reads These thinges with many other shall by good honest witnes be approved to be his opinions and Comon Speeches and that this Marlowe doth not only hould them himself but almost into every Company he Cometh he persuades men to Atheism willing them not to be afeard of bugbeares and hobgoblins and vtterly scorning both god and his ministers as I Richard Baines will Justify approue both by mine oth and the testimony of many honest men and almost al men with whome he hath Conversed any time will testify the same and as I think all men in Cristianity ought to indevor that the mouth of so dangerous a member may be stopped he saith likewise that he hath quoted a number of Contrarieties oute of the Scripture which he hath giuen to some great men who in Convenient time shalbe named. When these thinges shalbe Called in question the witnes shalbe produced. Similar examples of Marlowes statements were given by Thomas Kyd after his imprisonment and possible torture ; Kyd and Baines connect Marlowe with mathematician Thomas Harriots and Sir Walter Raleighs circle. Another document claimed about that time that one Marlowe is able to show more sound reasons for Atheism than any divine in England is able to give to prove divinity and that ... he hath read the Atheist lecture to Sir Walter Raleigh and others. Some critics believe that Marlowe sought to disseminate these views in his work and that he identified with his rebellious and iconoclastic protagonists. Plays had to be approved by the Master of the Revels before they could be performed and the censorship of publications was under the control of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Presumably these authorities did not consider any of Marlowes works to be unacceptable other than the Amores. It has been claimed that Marlowe was homosexual. Some scholars argue that the identification of an Elizabethan as gay or homosexual in the modern sense is anachronistic claiming that for the Elizabethans the terms were more likely to have been applied to homoerotic affections or sexual acts rather than to what we currently understand as a settled sexual orientation or personal role identity. Other scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowes homosexuality may be rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying all they that love not Tobacco Boies were fools. David Bevington and Eric C. Rasmussen describe Bainess evidence as unreliable testimony and hese and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would now regard as a witch-hunt. J. B. Steane considered there to be no evidence for Marlowes homosexuality at all. Other scholars point to the frequency with which Marlowe explores homosexual themes in his writing in Hero and Leander Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander in his looks were all that men desire...Edward the Second contains the following passage enumerating homosexual relationships The mightiest kings have had their minions;Great Alexander loved HephaestionThe conquering Hercules for Hylas wept;And for Patroclus stern Achilles drooped.And not kings only but the wisest menThe Roman Tully loved OctaviusGrave Socrates wild Alcibiades. Marlowe wrote the only play about the life of Edward II up to his time taking the humanist literary discussion of male sexuality much further than his contemporaries. The play was extremely bold dealing with a star-crossed love story between Edward II and Piers Gaveston. Though it was a common practice at the time to reveal characters as homosexual to give audiences reason to suspect them as culprits in a crime Christopher Marlowes Edward II is portrayed as a sympathetic character. The decision to start the play Dido Queen of Carthage with a homoerotic scene between Jupiter and Ganymede that bears no connection to the subsequent plot has long puzzled scholars. In early May 1593 several bills were posted about London threatening the Protestant refugees from France and the Netherlands who had settled in the city. One of these the Dutch church libel written in rhymed iambic pentameter contained allusions to several of Marlowes plays and was signed Tamburlaine. On 11 May the Privy Council ordered the arrest of those responsible for the libels. The next day Marlowes colleague Thomas Kyd was arrested his lodgings were searched and a three-page fragment of a heretical tract was found. In a letter to Sir John Puckering Kyd asserted that it had belonged to Marlowe with whom he had been writing in one chamber some two years earlier. In a second letter Kyd described Marlowe as blasphemous disorderly holding treasonous opinions being an irreligious reprobate and intemperate of a cruel hart. They had both been working for an aristocratic patron probably Ferdinando Stanley Lord Strange. A warrant for Marlowes arrest was issued on 18 May when the Privy Council apparently knew that he might be found staying with Thomas Walsingham whose father was a first cousin of the late Sir Francis Walsingham Elizabeths principal secretary in the 1580s and a man more deeply involved in state espionage than any other member of the Privy Council. Marlowe duly presented himself on 20 May but there apparently being no Privy Council meeting on that day was instructed to give his daily attendance on their Lordships until he shall be licensed to the contrary. On Wednesday 30 May Marlowe was killed. Various accounts of Marlowes death were current over the next few years. In his Palladis Tamia published in 1598 Francis Meres says Marlowe was stabbed to death by a bawdy serving-man a rival of his in his lewd love as punishment for his epicurism and atheism. In 1917 in the Dictionary of National Biography Sir Sidney Lee wrote on slender evidence that Marlowe was killed in a drunken fight. His claim was not much at variance with the official account which came to light only in 1925 when the scholar Leslie Hotson discovered the coroners report of the inquest on Marlowes death held two days later on Friday 1 June 1593 by the Coroner of the Queens Household William Danby. Marlowe had spent all day in a house in Deptford owned by the widow Eleanor Bull with three men Ingram Frizer Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley. All three had been employed by one or other of the Walsinghams. Skeres and Poley had helped snare the conspirators in the Babington plot and Frizer was a servant to Thomas Walsingham probably in the role of a financial or business agent as he was for Walsinghams wife Audrey a few years later. These witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had argued over payment of the bill exchanging divers malicious words while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch. Marlowe snatched Frizers dagger and wounded him on the head. In the ensuing struggle according to the coroners report Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St. Nicholas Deptford immediately after the inquest on 1 June 1593. The complete text of the inquest report was published by Leslie Hotson in his book The Death of Christopher Marlowe in the introduction to which Prof. George Kittredge said The mystery of Marlowes death heretofore involved in a cloud of contradictory gossip and irresponsible guess-work is now cleared up for good and all on the authority of public records of complete authenticity and gratifying fullness but this confidence proved fairly short-lived. Hotson had considered the possibility that the witnesses had concocted a lying account of Marlowes behaviour to which they swore at the inquest and with which they deceived the jury but came down against that scenario. Others began to suspect that this scenario was indeed the case. Writing to the Times Literary Supplement shortly after the books publication Eugénie de Kalb disputed that the struggle and outcome as described were even possible and Samuel A. Tannenbaum insisted the following year that such a wound could not have possibly resulted in instant death as had been claimed. Even Marlowes biographer John Bakeless acknowledged that some scholars have been inclined to question the truthfulness of the coroners report. There is something queer about the whole episode and said that Hotsons discovery raises almost as many questions as it answers. It has also been discovered more recently that the apparent absence of a local county coroner to accompany the Coroner of the Queens Household would if noticed have made the inquest null and void. One of the main reasons for doubting the truth of the inquest concerns the reliability of Marlowes companions as witnesses. As an agent provocateur for the late Sir Francis Walsingham Robert Poley was a consummate liar the very genius of the Elizabethan underworld and is on record as saying I will swear and forswear myself rather than I will accuse myself to do me any harm. The other witness Nicholas Skeres had for many years acted as a confidence trickster drawing young men into the clutches of people in the money-lending racket including Marlowes apparent killer Ingram Frizer with whom he was engaged in such a swindle. Despite their being referred to as generosi in the inquest report the witnesses were professional liars. Some biographers such as Kuriyama and Downie take the inquest to be a true account of what occurred but in trying to explain what really happened if the account was not true others have come up with a variety of murder theories Since there are only written documents on which to base any conclusions and since it is probable that the most crucial information about his death was never committed to paper it is unlikely that the full circumstances of Marlowes death will ever be known. For his contemporaries in the literary world Marlowe was above all an admired and influential artist. Within weeks of his death George Peele remembered him as Marley the Muses darling; Michael Drayton noted that he Had in him those brave translunary things That the first poets had and Ben Jonson wrote of Marlowes mighty line. Thomas Nashe wrote warmly of his friend poor deceased Kit Marlowe as did the publisher Edward Blount in his dedication of Hero and Leander to Sir Thomas Walsingham. Among the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about Marlowe was the anonymous author of the Cambridge University play The Return from Parnassus who wrote Pity it is that wit so ill should dwell Wit lent from heaven but vices sent from hell. The most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by Shakespeare in As You Like It where he not only quotes a line from Hero and Leander but also gives to the clown Touchstone the words When a mans verses cannot be understood nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. This appears to be a reference to Marlowes murder which involved a fight over the reckoning the bill as well as to a line in Marlowes Jew of Malta Infinite riches in a little room. Shakespeare was much influenced by Marlowe in his work as can be seen in the use of Marlovian themes in Antony and Cleopatra The Merchant of Venice Richard II and Macbeth . In Hamlet after meeting with the travelling actors Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War which at 2.2.429432 has an echo of Marlowes Dido Queen of Carthage. In Loves Labours Lost Shakespeare brings on a character Marcade in conscious acknowledgement of Marlowes character Mercury also attending the King of Navarre in Massacre at Paris. The significance to those of Shakespeares audience who were familiar with Hero and Leander was Marlowes identification of himself with the god Mercury. An argument has arisen about the notion that Marlowe faked his death and then continued to write under the assumed name of William Shakespeare. Academic consensus rejects alternative candidates for authorship of Shakespeares plays and sonnets including Marlowe. Six dramas have been attributed to the authorship of Christopher Marlowe either alone or in collaboration with other writers with varying degrees of evidence. The writing sequence or chronology of these plays is mostly unknown and is offered here with any dates and evidence known. Among the little available information we have Dido is believed to be the first Marlowe play performed while it was Tamburlaine that was first to be performed on a regular commercial stage in London in 1587. Believed by many scholars to be Marlowes greatest success Tamburlaine was the first English play written in blank verse and with Thomas Kyds The Spanish Tragedy is generally considered the beginning of the mature phase of the Elizabethan theatre. The play Lusts Dominion was attributed to Marlowe upon its initial publication in 1657 though scholars and critics have almost unanimously rejected the attribution. He may also have written or co-written Arden of Faversham. Publication and responses to the poetry and translations credited to Marlowe primarily occurred posthumously including Modern scholars still look for evidence of collaborations between Marlowe and other writers. In 2016 one publisher was the first to endorse the scholarly claim of a collaboration between Marlowe and the playwright William Shakespeare Marlowes plays were enormously successful possibly because of the imposing stage presence of his lead actor Edward Alleyn. Alleyn was unusually tall for the time and the haughty roles of Tamburlaine Faustus and Barabas were probably written for him. Marlowes plays were the foundation of the repertoire of Alleyns company the Admirals Men throughout the 1590s. One of Marlowes poetry translations did not fare as well. In 1599 Marlowes translation of Ovid was banned and copies were publicly burned as part of Archbishop Whitgifts crackdown on offensive material. First recorded performance between 1587 and 1593 by the Children of the Chapel a company of boy actors in London. Significance This play is believed by many scholars to be the first play by Christopher Marlowe to be performed. Attribution The title page attributes the play to Marlowe and Thomas Nashe yet some scholars question how much of a contribution Nashe made to the play. Evidence No manuscripts by Marlowe exist for this play. First published 1590 Parts I and II in one octavo London. No author named. First recorded performance 1587 Part I by the Admirals Men London. Significance Tamburlaine is the first example of blank verse used in the dramatic literature of the Early Modern English theatre. Attribution Author name is missing from first printing in 1590. Attribution of this work by scholars to Marlowe is based upon comparison to his other verified works. Passages and character development in Tamburlane are similar to many other Marlowe works. Evidence No manuscripts by Marlowe exist for this play. Parts I and II were entered into the Stationers Register on 14 August 1590. The two parts were published together by the London printer Richard Jones in 1590; a second edition in 1592 and a third in 1597. The 1597 edition of the two parts were published separately in quarto by Edward White; part I in 1605 and part II in 1606. First published 1592; earliest extant edition 1633 First recorded performance 26 February 1592 by Lord Stranges acting company. Significance The performances of the play were a success and it remained popular for the next fifty years. This play helps to establish the strong theme of anti-authoritarianism that is found throughout Marlowes works. Evidence No manuscripts by Marlowe exist for this play. The play was entered in the Stationers Register on 17 May 1594 but the earliest surviving printed edition is from 1633. First published 1601 no extant copy; first extant copy 1604 quarto; 1616 quarto. First recorded performance 15941597; 24 revival performances occurred between these years by the Lord Admirals Company Rose Theatre London; earlier performances probably occurred around 1589 by the same company. Significance This is the first dramatised version of the Faust legend of a scholars dealing with the devil. Marlowe deviates from earlier versions of The Devils Pact significantly Marlowes protagonist is unable to burn his books or repent to a merciful God to have his contract annulled at the end of the play; he is carried off by demons; and in the 1616 quarto his mangled corpse is found by the scholar characters. Attribution The B text was highly edited and censored owing in part to the shifting theatre laws regarding religious words onstage during the seventeenth-century. Because it contains several additional scenes believed to be the additions of other playwrights particularly Samuel Rowley and William Bird a recent edition attributes the authorship of both versions to Christopher Marlowe and his collaborator and revisers. This recent edition has tried to establish that the A text was assembled from Marlowes work and another writer with the B text as a later revision. Evidence No manuscripts by Marlowe exist for this play. The two earliest-printed extant versions of the play A and B form a textual problem for scholars. Both were published after Marlowes death and scholars disagree which text is more representative of Marlowes original. Some editions are based on a combination of the two texts. Late-twentieth-century scholarly consensus identifies A text as more representative because it contains irregular character names and idiosyncratic spelling which are believed to reflect the authors handwritten manuscript or foul papers. In comparison B text is highly edited with several additional scenes possibly written by other playwrights. First published 1590; earliest extant edition 1594 octavo First recorded performance 1592 performed by the Earl of Pembrokes Men. Significance Considered by recent scholars as Marlowes most modern play because of its probing treatment of the private life of a king and unflattering depiction of the power politics of the time. The 1594 editions of Edward II and of Dido are the first published plays with Marlowes name appearing as the author. Evidence The play was entered into the Stationers Register on 6 July 1593 five weeks after Marlowes death. First official record c. alleged foul sheet by Marlowe of Scene 19; although authorship by Marlowe is contested by recent scholars the manuscript is believed written while the play was first performed and with an unknown purpose. First published undated c. or later octavo London; while this is the most complete surviving text it is near half the length of Marlowes other works and possibly a reconstruction. The printer and publisher credit E.A. for Edward White also appears on the 160506 printing of Marlowes Tamburlaine. First recorded performance 26 Jan 1593 by Lord Stranges Men at Henslowes Rose Theatre London under the title The Tragedy of the Guise; 1594 in the repertory of the Admirals Men. Significance The Massacre at Paris is considered Marlowes most dangerous play as agitators in London seized on its theme to advocate the murders of refugees from the low countries of the Spanish Netherlands and it warns Elizabeth I of this possibility in its last scene. It features the silent English Agent whom tradition has identified with Marlowe and his connexions to the secret service. Highest grossing play for Lord Stranges Men in 1593. Attribution A 1593 loose manuscript sheet of the play called a foul sheet is alleged to be by Marlowe and has been claimed by some scholars as the only extant play manuscript by the author. It could also provide an approximate date of composition for the play. When compared with the extant printed text and his other work other scholars reject the attribution to Marlowe. The only surviving printed text of this play is possibly a reconstruction from memory of Marlowes original performance text. Current scholarship notes that there are only 1147 lines in the play half the amount of a typical play of the 1590s. Other evidence that the extant published text may not be Marlowes original is the uneven style throughout with two-dimensional characterisations deteriorating verbal quality and repetitions of content. Evidence Never appeared in the Stationers Register. The Muse of Poetry a bronze sculpture by Edward Onslow Ford references Marlowe and his work. It was erected on Buttermarket Canterbury in 1891 and now stands outside the Marlowe Theatre in the city. In July 2002 a memorial window to Marlowe was unveiled by the Marlowe Society at Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey. Controversially a question mark was added to his generally accepted date of death. On 25 October 2011 a letter from Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells was published by The Times newspaper in which they called on the Dean and Chapter to remove the question mark on the grounds that it flew in the face of a mass of unimpugnable evidence. In 2012 they renewed this call in their e-book Shakespeare Bites Back adding that it denies history and again the following year in their book Shakespeare Beyond Doubt. The Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury Kent UK was named for Marlowe in 1949. Marlowe has been used as a character in books theatre film television games and radio. Modern scholarly collected works of Marlowe include
William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare ;clip-pathpolygon;height1px;margin-1px;overflowhidden;padding0;positionabsolute;width1px;white-spacenowrapTooltip baptised 26 April 1564 23 April 1616 was an English playwright poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the worlds pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called Englands national poet and the Bard of Avon . His extant works including collaborations consist of some 39 plays 154 sonnets three long narrative poems and a few other verses some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon Warwickshire. At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway with whom he had three children Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor writer and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlains Men later known as the Kings Men. At age 49 he appears to have retired to Stratford where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeares private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance his sexuality his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608 among them Hamlet Romeo and Juliet Othello King Lear and Macbeth all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of Shakespeares plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeares published a more definitive text known as the First Folio a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeares dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson a former rival of Shakespeare that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet not of an age but for all time. Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire and Mary Arden the daughter of an affluent landowning family. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown but is traditionally observed on 23 April Saint Georges Day. This date which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children and the eldest surviving son. Although no attendance records for the period survive most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the Kings New School in Stratford a free school chartered in 1553 about a quarter-mile from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era but grammar school curricula were largely similar the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors. At the age of 18 Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day two of Hathaways neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter Susanna baptised 26 May 1583. Twins son Hamnet and daughter Judith followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596. After the birth of the twins Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the complaints bill of a law case before the Queens Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589. Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeares lost years. Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe Shakespeares first biographer recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire a Catholic landowner who named a certain William Shakeshafte in his will. Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area. It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. By then he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greenes words but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe Thomas Nashe and Greene himself . The italicised phrase parodying the line Oh tigers heart wrapped in a womans hide from Shakespeares Henry VI Part 3 along with the pun Shake-scene clearly identify Shakespeare as Greenes target. As used here Johannes Factotum refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others rather than the more common universal genius. Greenes attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeares work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greenes remarks. After 1594 Shakespeares plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlains Men a company owned by a group of players including Shakespeare that soon became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603 the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I and changed its name to the Kings Men. All the worlds a stageand all the men and women merely playersthey have their exits and their entrances;and one man in his time plays many parts... In 1599 a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames which they named the Globe. In 1608 the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeares property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man and in 1597 he bought the second-largest house in Stratford New Place and in 1605 invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford. Some of Shakespeares plays were published in quarto editions beginning in 1594 and by 1598 his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonsons Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour and Sejanus His Fall . The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonsons Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623 however lists Shakespeare as one of the Principal Actors in all these Plays some of which were first staged after Volpone although one cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610 John Davies of Hereford wrote that good Will played kingly roles. In 1709 Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlets father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It and the Chorus in Henry V though scholars doubt the sources of that information. Throughout his career Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596 the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helens Bishopsgate north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599 the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there. By 1604 he had moved north of the river again to an area north of St Pauls Cathedral with many fine houses. There he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy a maker of womens wigs and other headgear. Nicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition repeated by Samuel Johnson that Shakespeare retired to Stratford some years before his death. He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers petition in 1635 Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans the Kings Men placed men players there which were Heminges Condell Shakespeare etc.. However it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 16111614. In 1612 he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoys daughter Mary. In March 1613 he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; and from November 1614 he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law John Hall. After 1610 Shakespeare wrote fewer plays and none are attributed to him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations probably with John Fletcher who succeeded him as the house playwright of the Kings Men. He retired in 1613 before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of Henry VIII on 29 June. Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52. He died within a month of signing his will a document which he begins by describing himself as being in perfect health. No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later John Ward the vicar of Stratford wrote in his notebook Shakespeare Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and it seems drank too hard for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors one refers to his relatively sudden death We wondered Shakespeare that thou wentst so soon From the worlds stage to the graves tiring room. He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician John Hall in 1607 and Judith had married Thomas Quiney a vintner two months before Shakespeares death. Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day his new son-in-law Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family. Shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to the first son of her body. The Quineys had three children all of whom died without marrying. The Halls had one child Elizabeth who married twice but died without children in 1670 ending Shakespeares direct line. Shakespeares will scarcely mentions his wife Anne who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically. He did make a point however of leaving her my second best bed a bequest that has led to much speculation. Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance. Shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church two days after his death. The epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008 Good frend for Iesvs sake forbeareTo digg the dvst encloased heare.Bleste be yͤ man yͭ spares thes stonesAnd cvrst be he yͭ moves my bones. Good friend for Jesus sake forbearTo dig the dust enclosed here.Blessed be the man that spares these stonesAnd cursed be he that moves my bones. Some time before 1623 a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing. Its plaque compares him to Nestor Socrates and Virgil. In 1623 in conjunction with the publication of the First Folio the Droeshout engraving was published. Shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world including funeral monuments in Southwark Cathedral and Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey. Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point as critics agree Shakespeare did mostly early and late in his career. The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeares plays are difficult to date precisely however and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus The Comedy of Errors The Taming of the Shrew and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeares earliest period. His first histories which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinsheds Chronicles of England Scotland and Ireland dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe by the traditions of medieval drama and by the plays of Seneca.The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona in which two friends appear to approve of rape the Shrews story of the taming of a womans independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics directors and audiences. Shakespeares early classical and Italianate comedies containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.A Midsummer Nights Dream is a witty mixture of romance fairy magic and comic lowlife scenes. Shakespeares next comedy the equally romantic Merchant of Venice contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing the charming rural setting of As You Like It and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeares sequence of great comedies. After the lyrical Richard II written almost entirely in verse Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s Henry IV parts 1 and 2 and Henry V. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes prose and poetry and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. This period begins and ends with two tragedies Romeo and Juliet the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence love and death; and Julius Caesarbased on Sir Thomas Norths 1579 translation of Plutarchs Parallel Liveswhich introduced a new kind of drama. According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro in Julius Caesar the various strands of politics character inwardness contemporary events even Shakespeares own reflections on the act of writing began to infuse each other. In the early 17th century Shakespeare wrote the so-called problem plays Measure for Measure Troilus and Cressida and Alls Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies. Many critics believe that Shakespeares greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular hero of one of Shakespeares greatest tragedies Hamlet has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character especially for his famous soliloquy which begins To be or not to be; that is the question. Unlike the introverted Hamlet whose fatal flaw is hesitation the heroes of the tragedies that followed Othello and King Lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement. The plots of Shakespeares tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. In Othello the villain Iago stokes Othellos sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. In King Lear the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lears youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty. In Macbeth the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeares tragedies uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn. In this play Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus contain some of Shakespeares finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot. In his final period Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays Cymbeline The Winters Tale and The Tempest as well as the collaboration Pericles Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeares part but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen probably with John Fletcher. Shakespeares works include the 36 plays printed in the First Folio of 1623 listed according to their folio classification as comedies histories and tragedies. Two plays not included in the First FolioThe Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles Prince of Tyre are now accepted as part of the canon with todays scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio. In the late 19th century Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies Dowdens term is often used. In 1896 Frederick S. Boas coined the term problem plays to describe four plays Alls Well That Ends Well Measure for Measure Troilus and Cressida and Hamlet. Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies he wrote. We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeares problem plays. The term much debated and sometimes applied to other plays remains in use though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy. It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. After the plagues of 159293 Shakespeares plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV Leonard Digges recording Let but Falstaff come Hal Poins the rest... and you scarce shall have a room. When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre the first playhouse built by actors for actors on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark. The Globe opened in autumn 1599 with Julius Caesar one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeares greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe including Hamlet Othello and King Lear. After the Lord Chamberlains Men were renamed the Kings Men in 1603 they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy the Kings Men performed seven of Shakespeares plays at court between 1 November 1604 and 31 October 1605 including two performances of The Merchant of Venice. After 1608 they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In Cymbeline for example Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting upon an eagle he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees. The actors in Shakespeares company included the famous Richard Burbage William Kempe Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeares plays including Richard III Hamlet Othello and King Lear. The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in Romeo and Juliet and Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing among other characters. He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin who played roles such as Touchstone in As You Like It and the fool in King Lear. In 1613 Sir Henry Wotton recorded that Henry VIII was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony. On 29 June however a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision. In 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell two of Shakespeares friends from the Kings Men published the First Folio a collected edition of Shakespeares plays. It contained 36 texts including 18 printed for the first time. The others had already appeared in quarto versionsflimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. No evidence suggests that Shakespeare approved these editions which the First Folio describes as stoln and surreptitious copies. Alfred Pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as bad quartos because of their adapted paraphrased or garbled texts which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. Where several versions of a play survive each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors from notes by actors or audience members or from Shakespeares own papers. In some cases for example Hamlet Troilus and Cressida and Othello Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear however while most modern editions do conflate them the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion. In 1593 and 1594 when the theatres were closed because of plague Shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovids Metamorphoses the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeares lifetime. A third narrative poem A Lovers Complaint in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lovers Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.The Phoenix and the Turtle printed in Robert Chesters 1601 Loves Martyr mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover the faithful turtle dove. In 1599 two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim published under Shakespeares name but without his permission. Published in 1609 the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeares non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership. Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599 Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeares sugred Sonnets among his private friends. Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeares intended sequence. He seems to have planned two contrasting series one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion and one about conflicted love for a fair young man . It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals or if the authorial I who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself though Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets Shakespeare unlocked his heart. Shall I compare thee to a summers dayThou art more lovely and more temperate... The 1609 edition was dedicated to a Mr. W.H. credited as the only begetter of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher Thomas Thorpe whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was despite numerous theories or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication. Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love sexual passion procreation death and time. Shakespeares first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits and the language is often rhetoricalwritten for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus in the view of some critics often hold up the action for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted. However Shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time Richards vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeares mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet Richard II and A Midsummer Nights Dream in the mid-1590s Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself. Shakespeares standard poetic form was blank verse composed in iambic pentameter. In practice this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful but its sentences tend to start pause and finish at the end of lines with the risk of monotony. Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet. Shakespeare uses it for example to convey the turmoil in Hamlets mind Sir in my heart there was a kind of fightingThat would not let me sleep. Methought I layWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. RashlyAnd praisd be rashness for itlet us knowOur indiscretion sometimes serves us well... After Hamlet Shakespeare varied his poetic style further particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley described this style as more concentrated rapid varied and in construction less regular not seldom twisted or elliptical. In the last phase of his career Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included run-on lines irregular pauses and stops and extreme variations in sentence structure and length. In Macbeth for example the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself ; ...pity like a naked new-born babe Striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsd Upon the sightless couriers of the air... . The listener is challenged to complete the sense. The late romances with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another clauses are piled up subject and object are reversed and words are omitted creating an effect of spontaneity. Shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre. Like all playwrights of the time he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeares mastery grew he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays however. In Shakespeares late romances he deliberately returned to a more artificial style which emphasised the illusion of theatre. Shakespeares work has made a significant and lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation plot language and genre. Until Romeo and Juliet for example romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.Soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events but Shakespeare used them to explore characters minds. His work heavily influenced later poetry. The Romantic poets attempted to revive Shakespearean verse drama though with little success. Critic George Steiner described all English verse dramas from Coleridge to Tennyson as feeble variations on Shakespearean themes.John Milton considered by many to be the most important English poet after Shakespeare wrote in tribute Thou in our wonder and astonishment Has built thyself a live-long monument. Shakespeare influenced novelists such as Thomas Hardy William Faulkner and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melvilles soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is a classic tragic hero inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeares works. These include three operas by Giuseppe Verdi Macbeth Otello and Falstaff whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites while William Hogarths 1745 painting of actor David Garrick playing Richard III was decisive in establishing the genre of theatrical portraiture in Britain. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli a friend of William Blake even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology in particular that of Hamlet for his theories of human nature. Shakespeare has been a rich source for filmmakers; Akira Kurosawa adapted Macbeth and King Lear as Throne of Blood and Ran respectively. Other examples of Shakespeare on film include Max Reinhardts A Midsummer Nights Dream Laurence Oliviers Hamlet and Al Pacinos documentary Looking For Richard.Orson Welles a lifelong lover of Shakespeare directed and starred in films of Macbeth and Othello and Chimes at Midnight in which he plays John Falstaff which Welles himself called his best work. In Shakespeares day English grammar spelling and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now and his use of language helped shape modern English.Samuel Johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his A Dictionary of the English Language the first serious work of its type. Expressions such as with bated breath and a foregone conclusion have found their way into everyday English speech. Shakespeares influence extends far beyond his native England and the English language. His reception in Germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century Shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in Germany and gradually became a classic of the German Weimar era; Christoph Martin Wieland was the first to produce complete translations of Shakespeares plays in any language. Actor and theatre director Simon Callow writes this master this titan this genius so profoundly British and so effortlessly universal each different culture German Italian Russian was obliged to respond to the Shakespearean example; for the most part they embraced it and him with joyous abandon as the possibilities of language and character in action that he celebrated liberated writers across the continent. Some of the most deeply affecting productions of Shakespeare have been non-English and non-European. He is that unique writer he has something for everyone. According to Guinness World Records Shakespeare remains the worlds best-selling playwright with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. He is also the third most translated author in history. Shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime but he received a large amount of praise. In 1598 the cleric and author Francis Meres singled him out from a group of English playwrights as the most excellent in both comedy and tragedy. The authors of the Parnassus plays at St Johns College Cambridge numbered him with Chaucer Gower and Spenser. In the First Folio Ben Jonson called Shakespeare the Soul of the age the applause delight the wonder of our stage although he had remarked elsewhere that Shakespeare wanted art . Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century classical ideas were in vogue. As a result critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson.Thomas Rymer for example condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly saying of Jonson I admire him but I love Shakespeare. He also famously remarked that Shakespeare was naturally learned; he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards and found her there. For several decades Rymers view held sway. But during the 18th century critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and like Dryden to acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790 added to his growing reputation. By 1800 he was firmly enshrined as the national poet and described as the Bard of Avon . In the 18th and 19th centuries his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire Goethe Stendhal and Victor Hugo. During the Romantic era Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the critic August Wilhelm Schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of German Romanticism. In the 19th century critical admiration for Shakespeares genius often bordered on adulation. This King Shakespeare the essayist Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1840 does not he shine in crowned sovereignty over us all as the noblest gentlest yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible. The Victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale. The playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw mocked the cult of Shakespeare worship as bardolatry claiming that the new naturalism of Ibsens plays had made Shakespeare obsolete. The modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century far from discarding Shakespeare eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T. S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeares primitiveness in fact made him truly modern. Eliot along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeares imagery. In the 1950s a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for post-modern studies of Shakespeare. By the 1980s Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism feminism New Historicism African-American studies and queer studies. Comparing Shakespeares accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology Harold Bloom wrote Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He encloses us because we see with his fundamental perceptions. Around 230 years after Shakespeares death doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him. Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford. Several group theories have also been proposed. All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution but interest in the subject particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship continues into the 21st century. Shakespeare conformed to the official state religion but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate. Shakespeares will uses a Protestant formula and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England where he was married his children were baptised and where he is buried. Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeares family were Catholics at a time when practising Catholicism in England was against the law. Shakespeares mother Mary Arden certainly came from a pious Catholic family. The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father John Shakespeare found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street. However the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity. In 1591 the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church for fear of process for debt a common Catholic excuse. In 1606 the name of Williams daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford. Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeares religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeares Catholicism Protestantism or lack of belief in his plays but the truth may be impossible to prove. Few details of Shakespeares sexuality are known. At 18 he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway who was pregnant. Susanna the first of their three children was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeares sonnets are autobiographical and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love. The 26 so-called Dark Lady sonnets addressed to a married woman are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons. No written contemporary description of Shakespeares physical appearance survives and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait so the Droeshout engraving which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led to the production of several fake portraits as well as misattributions repaintings and relabelling of portraits of other people.
John Donne,John Donne was an English poet scholar soldier and secretary born into a recusant family who later became a cleric in the Church of England. Under royal patronage he was made Dean of St Pauls Cathedral in London . He is considered the preeminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His poetical works are noted for their metaphorical and sensual style and include sonnets love poems religious poems Latin translations epigrams elegies songs and satires. He is also known for his sermons. Donnes style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes ironies and dislocations. These features along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms his tense syntax and his tough eloquence were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques. His early career was marked by poetry that bore immense knowledge of English society. Another important theme in Donnes poetry is the idea of true religion something that he spent much time considering and about which he often theorised. He wrote secular poems as well as erotic and love poems. He is particularly famous for his mastery of metaphysical conceits. Despite his great education and poetic talents Donne lived in poverty for several years relying heavily on wealthy friends. He spent much of the money he inherited during and after his education on womanising literature pastimes and travel. In 1601 Donne secretly married Anne More with whom he had twelve children. In 1615 he was ordained Anglican deacon and then priest although he did not want to take holy orders and only did so because the king ordered it. He served as a member of Parliament in 1601 and in 1614. Donne was born in London in 1571 or 1572 into a recusant Roman Catholic family when practice of that religion was illegal in England. Donne was the third of six children. His father also named John Donne was married to Elizabeth Heywood. He was of Welsh descent and a warden of the Ironmongers Company in the City of London. He avoided unwelcome government attention out of fear of religious persecution. His father died in 1576 when Donne was four years old leaving his mother Elizabeth with the responsibility of raising the children alone. Heywood was also from a recusant Roman Catholic family the daughter of John Heywood the playwright and sister of the Reverend Jasper Heywood a Jesuit priest and translator. She was a great-niece of Thomas More. A few months after her husband died Donnes mother married Dr. John Syminges a wealthy widower with three children of his own. Donne was educated privately. There is no evidence to support the popular claim that he was taught by Jesuits. In 1583 at the age of 11 he began studies at Hart Hall now Hertford College Oxford. After three years of studies there Donne was admitted to the University of Cambridge where he studied for another three years. Donne could not obtain a degree from either institution because of his Catholicism since he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy required to graduate. In 1591 he was accepted as a student at the Thavies Inn legal school one of the Inns of Chancery in London. On 6 May 1592 he was admitted to Lincolns Inn one of the Inns of Court. In 1593 five years after the defeat of the Spanish Armada and during the intermittent Anglo-Spanish War Queen Elizabeth issued the first English statute against sectarian dissent from the Church of England titled An Act for restraining Popish recusants. It defined Popish recusants as those convicted for not repairing to some Church Chapel or usual place of Common Prayer to hear Divine Service there but forbearing the same contrary to the tenor of the laws and statutes heretofore made and provided in that behalf. Donnes brother Henry was also a university student prior to his arrest in 1593 for harbouring a Catholic priest William Harrington and died in Newgate Prison of bubonic plague leading Donne to begin questioning his Catholic faith. During and after his education Donne spent much of his considerable inheritance on women literature pastimes and travel. Although no record details precisely where Donne travelled he crossed Europe. He later fought alongside the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh against the Spanish at Cadiz and the Azores and witnessed the loss of the Spanish flagship the San Felipe. According to his earliest biographer  By the age of 25 he was well prepared for the diplomatic career he appeared to be seeking. He was appointed chief secretary to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal Sir Thomas Egerton and was established at Egertons London home York House Strand close to the Palace of Whitehall then the most influential social centre in England. During the next four years Donne fell in love with Egertons niece Anne More. They were secretly married just before Christmas in 1601 against the wishes of both Egerton and Annes father George More who was Lieutenant of the Tower. Upon discovery this wedding ruined Donnes career getting him dismissed and put in Fleet Prison along with the Church of England priest Samuel Brooke who married them and his brother Christopher who stood in in the absence of George More to give Anne away. Donne was released shortly thereafter when the marriage was proved to be valid and he soon secured the release of the other two. Walton tells us that when Donne wrote to his wife to tell her about losing his post he wrote after his name John Donne Anne Donne Un-done. It was not until 1609 that Donne was reconciled with his father-in-law and received his wifes dowry. After his release Donne had to accept a retired country life in a small house in Pyrford Surrey owned by Annes cousin Sir Francis Wooley where they lived until the end of 1604. In spring 1605 they moved to another small house in Mitcham Surrey where he scraped a meagre living as a lawyer while Anne Donne bore a new baby almost every year. Though he also worked as an assistant pamphleteer to Thomas Morton writing anti-Catholic pamphlets Donne was in a constant state of financial insecurity. Anne gave birth to twelve children in sixteen years of marriage including two stillbirthstheir eighth and then in 1617 their last child. The ten surviving children were Constance John George Francis Lucy Bridget Mary Nicholas Margaret and Elizabeth. Three Francis Nicholas and Mary died before they were ten. In a state of despair that almost drove him to kill himself Donne noted that the death of a child would mean one mouth fewer to feed but he could not afford the burial expenses. During this time Donne wrote but did not publish Biathanatos his defence of suicide. His wife died on 15 August 1617 five days after giving birth to their twelfth child a still-born baby. Donne mourned her deeply and wrote of his love and loss in his 17th Holy Sonnet. In 1602 Donne was elected as a member of parliament for the constituency of Brackley but the post was not a paid position. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 being succeeded by King James VI of Scotland as King James I of England. The fashion for coterie poetry of the period gave Donne a means to seek patronage. Many of his poems were written for wealthy friends or patrons especially for MP Sir Robert Drury of Hawsted whom he met in 1610 and who became his chief patron furnishing him and his family an apartment in his large house in Drury Lane. In 1610 and 1611 Donne wrote two anti-Catholic polemics Pseudo-Martyr and Ignatius His Conclave for Morton. He then wrote two Anniversaries An Anatomy of the World and Of the Progress of the Soul for Drury. Donne sat as an MP again this time for Taunton in the Addled Parliament of 1614. Though he attracted five appointments within its business he made no recorded speech. Although King James was pleased with Donnes work he refused to reinstate him at court and instead urged him to take holy orders. At length Donne acceded to the kings wishes and in 1615 was an ordained priest in the Church of England. In 1615 Donne was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity from Cambridge University. He became a Royal Chaplain in the same year. He became a reader of divinity at Lincolns Inn in 1616 where he served in the chapel as minister until 1622. In 1618 he became chaplain to Viscount Doncaster who was an ambassador to the princes of Germany. Donne did not return to England until 1620. In 1621 Donne was made Dean of St Pauls a leading and well-paid position in the Church of England which he held until his death in 1631. In 1616 he was granted the living as rector of two parishes Keyston in Huntingdonshire and Sevenoaks in Kent and in 1621 of Blunham in Bedfordshire all held until his death. Blunham Parish Church has an imposing stained glass window commemorating Donne designed by Derek Hunt. During Donnes period as dean his daughter Lucy died aged eighteen. In late November and early December 1623 he suffered a nearly fatal illness thought to be either typhus or a combination of a cold followed by a period of fever. During his convalescence he wrote a series of meditations and prayers on health pain and sickness that were published as a book in 1624 under the title of Devotions upon Emergent Occasions. One of these meditations Meditation XVII contains the well-known phrases No man is an Iland and ...for whom the bell tolls. In 1624 he became vicar of St Dunstan-in-the-West and in 1625 a prolocutor to Charles I. He earned a reputation as an eloquent preacher. A total of 160 of his sermons have survived including Deaths Duel his famous sermon delivered at the Palace of Whitehall before King Charles I in February 1631. Donne died on 31 March 1631. He was buried in old St Pauls Cathedral where a memorial statue of him by Nicholas Stone was erected with a Latin epigraph probably composed by himself. The memorial was one of the few to survive the Great Fire of London in 1666 and is now in St Pauls Cathedral. The statue was said by Izaac Walton in his biography to have been modelled from the life by Donne to suggest his appearance at the resurrection. It started a vogue of such monuments during the 17th century. In 2012 a bust of the poet by Nigel Boonham was unveiled outside in the cathedral churchyard. Donnes earliest poems showed a developed knowledge of English society coupled with sharp criticism of its problems. His satires dealt with common Elizabethan topics such as corruption in the legal system mediocre poets and pompous courtiers. His images of sickness vomit manure and plague reflected his strongly satiric view of a society populated by fools and knaves. His third satire however deals with the problem of true religion a matter of great importance to Donne. He argued that it was better to examine carefully ones religious convictions than blindly to follow any established tradition for none would be saved at the Final Judgment by claiming A Harry or a Martin taught this. Donnes early career was also notable for his erotic poetry especially his elegies in which he employed unconventional metaphors such as a flea biting two lovers being compared to sex. Donne did not publish these poems although they circulated widely in manuscript form. One such a previously unknown manuscript that is believed to be one of the largest contemporary collections of Donnes work was found at Melford Hall in November 2018. Some have speculated that Donnes numerous illnesses financial strain and the deaths of his friends all contributed to the development of a more sombre and pious tone in his later poems. The change can be clearly seen in An Anatomy of the World a poem that Donne wrote in memory of Elizabeth Drury daughter of his patron Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead Suffolk. This poem treats Elizabeths demise with extreme gloominess using it as a symbol for the fall of man and the destruction of the universe. The increasing gloominess of Donnes tone may also be observed in the religious works that he began writing during the same period. Having converted to the Anglican Church Donne quickly became noted for his sermons and religious poems. Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death and the fear that it inspired in many on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X Death Be Not Proud. Even as he lay dying during Lent in 1631 he rose from his sickbed and delivered the Deaths Duel sermon which was later described as his own funeral sermon. Deaths Duel portrays life as a steady descent to suffering and death; death becomes merely another process of life in which the winding sheet of the womb is the same as that of the grave. Hope is seen in salvation and immortality through an embrace of God Christ and the Resurrection. His work has received much criticism over the years especially concerning his metaphysical form. Donne is generally considered the most prominent member of the metaphysical poets a phrase coined in 1781 by Samuel Johnson following a comment on Donne by John Dryden. Dryden had written of Donne in 1693 He affects the metaphysics not only in his satires but in his amorous verses where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy when he should engage their hearts and entertain them with the softnesses of love. In Life of Cowley Johnson refers to the beginning of the 17th century in which there appeared a race of writers that may be termed the metaphysical poets. Donnes immediate successors in poetry therefore tended to regard his works with ambivalence with the Neoclassical poets regarding his conceits as abuse of the metaphor. However he was revived by Romantic poets such as Coleridge and Browning though his more recent revival in the early 20th century by poets such as T. S. Eliot and critics like F. R. Leavis tended to portray him with approval as an anti-Romantic. Donne is considered a master of the metaphysical conceit an extended metaphor that combines two vastly different ideas into a single idea often using imagery. An example of this is his equation of lovers with saints in The Canonization. Unlike the conceits found in other Elizabethan poetry most notably Petrarchan conceits which formed clichéd comparisons between more closely related objects metaphysical conceits go to a greater depth in comparing two completely unlike objects. One of the most famous of Donnes conceits is found in A Valediction Forbidding Mourning where he compares the apartness of two separated lovers to the working of the legs of a compass. Donnes works are also witty employing paradoxes puns and subtle yet remarkable analogies. His pieces are often ironic and cynical especially regarding love and human motives. Common subjects of Donnes poems are love death and religion. John Donnes poetry represented a shift from classical forms to more personal poetry. Donne is noted for his poetic metre which was structured with changing and jagged rhythms that closely resemble casual speech . Some scholars believe that Donnes literary works reflect the changing trends of his life with love poetry and satires from his youth and religious sermons during his later years. Other scholars such as Helen Gardner question the validity of this datingmost of his poems were published posthumously . The exception to these is his Anniversaries which were published in 1612 and Devotions upon Emergent Occasions published in 1624. His sermons are also dated sometimes specifically by date and year. Donne is remembered in the Calendar of Saints of the Church of England the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar and the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America for his life as both poet and priest. His commemoration is on 31 March. During his lifetime several likenesses were made of the poet. The earliest was the anonymous portrait of 1594 now in the National Portrait Gallery London which was restored in 2012. One of the earliest Elizabethan portraits of an author the fashionably dressed poet is shown darkly brooding on his love. The portrait was described in Donnes will as that picture of myne wych is taken in the shaddowes and bequeathed by him to Robert Kerr 1st Earl of Ancram. Other paintings include a 1616 head and shoulders after Isaac Oliver also in the National Portrait Gallery and a 1622 head and shoulders in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1911 the young Stanley Spencer devoted a visionary painting to John Donne arriving in heaven which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum. Donnes reception until the 20th century was influenced by the publication of his writings in the 17th century. Because Donne avoided publication during his life the majority of his works were brought to the press by others in the decades after his death. These publications present what Erin McCarthy calls a teleological narrative of Donnes growth from young rake Jack Donne to reverend divine Dr. Donne. For example while the first edition of Poems by J. D. mingled amorous and pious verse indiscriminately all editions after 1635 separated poems into Songs and Sonnets and Divine Poems. This organization promulgated the tale of Jack Donnes transformation into Doctor Donne and made it the dominant way of understanding Donnes life and work. A similar effort to justify Donnes early writings appeared in the publication of his prose. This pattern can be seen in a 1652 volume that combines texts from throughout Donnes career including flippant works like Ignatius His Conclave and more pious writings like Essays in Divinity. In the preface Donnes son unifies the otherwise disparate texts around an impression of Donnes divinity by comparing his fathers varied writing to Jesus miracles. Christ began his first Miracle here by turning Water into Wine and made it his last to ascend from Earth to Heaven. Donne first wrote things conducing to cheerfulness entertainment of Mankind and later change salvation to his brethren. The idea that Donnes writings reflect two distinct stages of his life remains common; however many scholars have challenged this understanding. In 1948 Evelyn Simpson wrote a close study of his works... makes it clear that his was no case of dual personality. He was not a Jekyll-Hyde in Jacobean dress... There is an essential unity underlying the flagrant and manifold contradictions of his temperament. After Donnes death a number of poetical tributes were paid to him of which one of the principal was his friend Lord Herbert of Cherburys Elegy for Doctor Donne. Posthumous editions of Donnes poems were accompanied by several Elegies upon the Author over the course of the next two centuries. Six of these were written by fellow churchmen others by such courtly writers as Thomas Carew Sidney Godolphin and Endymion Porter. In 1963 came Joseph Brodskys The Great Elegy for John Donne. Beginning in the 20th century several historical novels appeared taking as their subject various episodes in Donnes life. His courtship of Anne More is the subject of Elizabeth Gray Vinings Take Heed of Loving Me A novel about John Donne and Maeve Harans The Lady and the Poet . Both characters also make interspersed appearances in Mary Noviks Conceit where the main focus is on their rebellious daughter Pegge. English treatments include Garry OConnors Deaths Duel a novel of John Donne which deals with the poet as a young man. He also plays a significant role in Christie Dickasons The Noble Assassin a novel based on the life of Donnes patron and his lover Lucy Russell Countess of Bedford. Finally there is Bryan Crocketts Loves Alchemy a John Donne Mystery in which the poet blackmailed into service in Robert Cecils network of spies attempts to avert political disaster and at the same time outwit Cecil. There were musical settings of Donnes lyrics even during his lifetime and in the century following his death. These included Alfonso Ferrabosco the youngers ; John Coopers ; Henry Lawes ; John Dowlands ; and settings of A Hymn to God the Father by John Hilton the younger and Pelham Humfrey . After the 17th century there were no more until the start of the 20th century with Havergal Brian Eleanor Everest Freer and Walford Davies among the earliest. In 191618 the composer Hubert Parry set Donnes Holy Sonnet 7 to music in his choral work Songs of Farewell.Regina Hansen Willman set Donnes First Holy Sonnet for voice and string trio. In 1945 Benjamin Britten set nine of Donnes Holy Sonnets in his song cycle for voice and piano The Holy Sonnets of John Donne. in 1968 Williametta Spencer used Donnes text for her choral work At the Round Earths Imagined Corners. Among them is also the choral setting of Negative Love that opens Harmonium as well as the aria setting of Holy Sonnet XIV at the end of the 1st act of Doctor Atomic both by John Adams. There have been settings in popular music as well. One is the version of the song Go and Catch a Falling Star on John Renbourns debut album John Renbourn in which the last line is altered to False ere I count one two three. On their 1992 album Duality the English Neoclassical dark wave band In the Nursery used a recitation of the entirety of Donnes A Valediction Forbidding Mourning for the track Mecciano and an augmented version of A Fever for the track Corruption.Prose texts by Donne have also been set to music. In 1954 Priaulx Rainier set some in her Cycle for Declamation for solo voice. In 2009 the American Jennifer Higdon composed the choral piece On the Death of the Righteous based on Donnes sermons. Still more recent is the Russian minimalist Anton Batagovs I Fear No More selected songs and meditations of John Donne . Singer-songwriter Van Morrison refers to the poet in his song Rave On John Donne from his 1983 album Inarticulate Speech of the Heart.
Emilia Lanier,Emilia Lanier née Aemilia Bassano was an English poet and the first woman in England to assert herself as a professional poet through her volume Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum . Attempts have been made to equate her with Shakespeares Dark Lady.  Emilia Laniers life appears in her letters poetry and medical and legal records and in sources for the social contexts in which she lived. Researchers have found interactions with Lanier in astrologer Dr Simon Formans professional diary the earliest known casebook kept by an English medical practitioner. She visited Forman many times in 1597 for consultations that incorporated astrological readings as was usual in the medical practice of the period. The evidence from Forman is incomplete and sometimes hard to read . However his notes show she was an ambitious woman keen to rise into the gentry class. Church records show Lanier was baptised Aemilia Bassano at the parish church of St Botolph Bishopsgate on 27 January 1569. Her father Baptiste Bassano was a Venetian-born musician at the court of Elizabeth I. Her mother was Margret Johnson who was possibly an aunt of the court composer Robert Johnson. Laniers sister Angela Bassano married Joseph Hollande in 1576 but neither of her brothers Lewes and Phillip reached adulthood. It has been suggested and disputed that Laniers family was Jewish or of partly Jewish descent. Susanne Woods calls the evidence for it circumstantial but cumulatively possible. Leeds Barroll says Lanier was probably a Jew her baptism being part of the vexed context of Jewish assimilation in Tudor England. Baptiste Bassano died on 11 April 1576 when Emilia was seven years old. His will instructed his wife that he had left young Emilia a dowry of 100 to be given to her when she turned 21 or on the day of her wedding whichever came first. Formans records indicate that Bassanos fortune might have waned before he died which caused considerable unhappiness. Formans records also indicate that after the death of her father Lanier went to live with Susan Bertie Countess of Kent. Some scholars question whether Lanier went to serve Bertie or be fostered by her but there is no conclusive evidence for either possibility. It was in Berties house that Lanier was given a humanist education and learnt Latin. Bertie greatly valued and emphasized the importance of girls receiving the same level of education as young men. This probably influenced Lanier and her decision to publish her writings. After living with Bertie Lanier went to live with Margaret Clifford Countess of Cumberland and Margarets daughter Lady Anne Clifford. Dedications in Laniers own poetry seem to confirm this information. Laniers mother died when Lanier was 18. Church records show that Johnson was buried in Bishopsgate on 7 July 1587. Not long after her mothers death Lanier became the mistress of The 1st Baron Hunsdon a Tudor courtier and cousin of Queen Elizabeth I. At the time Lord Hunsdon was Elizabeths Lord Chamberlain and a patron of the arts and theatre but he was 45 years older than Lanier and records show he gave her a pension of 40 a year. Records indicate that Lanier enjoyed her time as his mistress. An entry from Formans diary reads hath bin married 4 years The old Lord Chamberlain kept her longue She was maintained in great pomp ... she hath 40 a yere was welthy to him that married her in monie Jewells. In 1592 when she was 23 Lanier became pregnant with Hunsdons child but he paid her off with a sum of money. Lanier was then married to her first cousin once removed Alfonso Lanier. He was a Queens musician; church records show the marriage taking place at St Botolphs Aldgate on 18 October 1592. Formans diary entries imply that Laniers marriage was unhappy. The diary also relates that Lanier was happier as Lord Hunsdons mistress than as Alfonsos bride for a nobleman that is ded hath Loved her well kept her and did maintain her longe but her husband hath delte hardly with her and spent and consumed her goods and she is nowe... in debt. Another of Formans entries states that Lanier told him about having several miscarriages. Lanier gave birth to a son Henry in 1593 and a daughter Odillya in 1598. Odillya died when she was ten months old and was buried at St Botolphs. In 1611 Lanier published her volume of poetry Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum. Lanier 42 years old at the time was the first woman in England to declare herself a poet. People who read her poetry considered it radical and many scholars today refer to its style and arguments as protofeminist. After Alfonsos death in 1613 Lanier supported herself by running a school. She rented a house from Edward Smith to house her students but disputes over the rental led to her being arrested twice between 1617 and 1619. Parents then proved unwilling to send their children to a woman with a history of arrest and Laniers aspirations of running a prosperous school came to an end. Laniers son eventually married Joyce Mansfield in 1623; they had two children Mary and Henry . Henry senior died in October 1633. Later court documents imply that Lanier may have been providing for her two grandchildren after their fathers death. Little else is known of Laniers life between 1619 and 1635. Court documents state that she sued her husbands brother Clement for money owed to her from the profits of one of her late husbands financial patents. The court ruled in Laniers favour requiring Clement to pay her 20. Clement could not pay immediately and so Lanier brought the suit back to court in 1636 and in 1638. There are no records to say whether Lanier was ever paid in full but at the time of her death she was described as a pensioner i. e. someone who has a steady income or pension. Emilia Lanier died at the age of 76 and was buried at Clerkenwell on 3 April 1645. In 1611 at the age of 42 Lanier published a collection of poetry called Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum . At the time it was still highly unusual for an Englishwoman to publish especially in an attempt to make a living. Emilia was only the fourth woman in the British Isles to publish poetry. Hitherto Isabella Whitney had published a 38-page pamphlet of poetry partly written by her correspondents Anne Dowriche who was Cornish and Elizabeth Melville who was Scottish. So Laniers book is the first book of substantial original poetry written by an Englishwoman. She wrote it in the hope of attracting a patron. It was also the first potentially feminist work published in England as all the dedications are to women and the title poem Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum about the crucifixion of Christ is written from a womans point of view. Her poems advocate and praise female virtue and Christian piety but reflect a desire for an idealized classless world. Source analysis shows that Lanier draws on work that she mentions reading including Edmund Spenser Ovid Petrarch Chaucer Boccaccio Agrippa as well as protofeminists like Veronica Franco and Christine de Pizan. Lanier makes use of two unpublished manuscripts and a published play translation by Mary Sidney Countess of Pembroke. She also shows a knowledge of stage plays by John Lyly and Samuel Daniel. The work of Samuel Daniel informs her Masque a theatrical form identified in her letter to Mary Sidney and resembling the Masque in The Tempest. The title poem Salve Deus Rex Judæorum is prefaced by ten shorter dedicated poems all for aristocratic women beginning with the Queen. There is also a prose preface addressed to the reader containing a vindication of virtuous women against their detractors. The title poem a narrative work of over 200 stanzas tells the story of Christs passion satirically and almost entirely from the point of view of the women who surround him. The title comes from the words of mockery supposedly addressed to Jesus on the Cross. The satirical nature of the poem was first emphasized by Boyd Berry. Although the topics of virtue and religion were seen as suitable themes for women writers Laniers title poem has been viewed by some modern scholars as a parody of the Crucifixion since Lanier approaches it with imagery of the Elizabethan grotesque found for instance in some Shakespeare plays. Her views have been interpreted as independent of church tradition and heretical. Other scholars including A. L. Rowse view Laniers conversion as genuine and her passionate devotion to Christ and to his mother as sincere. Still comparisons have been made between Laniers poem and religious satires that scholars have studied in Shakespearean works including the poem The Phoenix and the Turtle and many of the plays. In the central section of Salve Deus Lanier takes up the Querelle des Femmes by redefining Christian doctrine of The Fall and attacking Original Sin which is the foundation of Christian theology and Pauline doctrine about women causing it. Lanier defends Eve and women in general by arguing that Eve is wrongly blamed for Original Sin while no blame attached to Adam. She argues that Adam shares the guilt as he is shown in the Bible as being stronger than Eve and so capable of resisting the temptation. She also defends women by noting the dedication of Christs female followers in staying with him through the Crucifixion and first seeking him after the burial and Resurrection. In Salve Deus Lanier also draws attention to Pilates wife a minor character in the Bible who attempts to prevent the unjust trial and crucifixion of Christ. She also notes the male apostles that forsook and even denied Christ during His Crucifixion. Lanier repeats the anti-Semitic aspects of the Gospel accounts hostile attitudes towards the Jews for not preventing the Crucifixion such views were the norm for her period. There is no scholarly consensus on the religious motivation of the title poem. Some call it a genuinely religious poem from a strong female angle. Others see it as a piece of clever satire. Although there is no agreement on intent and motive most scholars note the strong feminist sentiments throughout Salve Deus Rex Judæorum. Laniers book ends with the Description of Cookham commemorating Margaret Clifford Countess of Cumberland and her daughter Lady Anne Clifford. This is the first published country-house poem in English Laniers inspiration came from a stay at Cookham Dean where Margaret Clifford Countess of Cumberland lived with her daughter Lady Anne Clifford for whom Lanier was engaged as tutor and companion. The Clifford household possessed a significant library some of which can be identified in the painting The Great Picture attributed to Jan van Belcamp. As Helen Wilcox asserts the poem is an allegory of the expulsion from Eden. Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum has been viewed by many as one of the earliest feminist works in English literature. Barbara Kiefer Lewalski in an article Writing Women and Reading the Renaissance actually calls Lanier the defender of womankind. Lewalski believes Lanier initiates her ideas of the genealogy of women with the first few poems in the collection as dedications to prominent women. This follows the idea that virtue and learning descend from mothers to daughters. Marie H. Loughlin continues Lewalskis argument in Fast tid unto Them in a Golden Chaine Typology Apocalypse and Womans Genealogy in Aemilia Laniers Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum by noting that the genealogy of women began with Eve. Loughlin argues that Lanier advocates the importance of knowledge of the spiritual and the material worlds in womens connection. Lanier seems to argue that women must focus on the material world and their importance in it to complement their life in the spiritual world. The argument derives from Laniers seeming desire to raise women to the level of men. Some have speculated that Lanier was Shakespeares Dark Lady. The identification first proposed by A. L. Rowse has been repeated by several authors since. It appears in David Lasocki and Roger Priors book The Bassanos Venetian Musicians and Instrument makers in England 15311665 and in Stephanie Hopkins Hughes. Although the colour of Laniers hair is not known records exist of her Bassano cousins being referred to as black a common term at the time for brunettes or people with Mediterranean colouring. Since she came from a family of Court musicians she fits Shakespeares picture of a woman playing the virginal in Sonnet 128. Shakespeare claims that the woman was forsworn to another in Sonnet 152 which has been speculated to refer to Laniers relations with Shakespeares patron Lord Hunsdon. The theory that Lanier was the Dark Lady is doubted by other Lanier scholars such as Susanne Woods . Barbara Lewalski notes that Rowses theory has deflected attention from Lanier as a poet. However Martin Green argued that although Rowses argument was unfounded he was correct in saying that Lanier is referred to in the Sonnets. Playwrights musicians and poets have also expressed views. The theatre historian and playwright Andrew B. Harris wrote a play The Lady Revealed which chronicles Rowses identification of Lanier as the Dark Lady. After readings in London and at the Players Club it received a staged reading at New Dramatists in New York City on 16 March 2015. In 2005 the English conductor Peter Bassano a descendant of Emilias brother suggested she provided some of the texts for William Byrds 1589 Songs of Sundrie Natures dedicated to Lord Hunsdon and that one of the songs a setting of the translation of an Italian sonnet Of Gold all Burnisht may have been used by Shakespeare as the model for his parodic Sonnet 130 My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun. The Irish poet Niall McDevitt also believes Lanier was the Dark Lady She spurned his advances somewhere along the line and he never won her back.... Its a genuine story of unrequited love. Tony Haygarth has argued that a certain 1593 miniature portrait by Nicholas Hilliard depicts Lanier. John Hudson points out that the names Emilia in Othello and Bassanio in The Merchant of Venice coincide with mentions of a swan dying to music which he sees as a standard Ovidian image of a great poet. He asserts that the swan song may be a literary device used in some classical writings to conceal the name of an author. However the notion that a dying swan sings a melodious swan song was proverbial and its application to a character need not prove the character is being presented as a poet. So the evidence remains inconclusive and perhaps coincidental. Furthermore Prior argues that the play Othello refers to a location in the town of Bassano and that the title of the play may refer to the Jesuit Girolamo Otello from the town of Bassano. The character Emilia speaks some of the first feminist lines on an English stage and so could be seen as a contemporary allegory for Emilia Lanier herself while the musicians in both plays Prior argues are allegories for members of her family. Hudson further believes that another signature exists in Titus Andronicus where an Aemilius and a Bassianus each hold a crown. Each mirrors the others position at the beginning and end of the play as rhetorical markers indicating that the two names are a pair and book-end the bulk of the play. In November 2020 Peter Bassano a descendant of Laniers uncle published a book Shakespeare and Emilia claiming to have found proof that Lanier is the Dark Lady. Bassano points to the similarity of Hilliards alternative miniature to a description of Lord Birons desired wife in Loves Labours Lost A whitely wanton with a velvet brow. With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes. Lanier was a member of the minor gentry through her Italian fathers appointment as a royal musician. She was further educated in the household of Susan Bertie Countess of Kent. After her parents death Lanier was the mistress of Henry Carey 1st Baron Hunsdon first cousin of Elizabeth I of England. In 1592 she became pregnant by Carey and was subsequently married to court musician Alfonso Lanier her cousin. She had two children but only one survived into adulthood. Lanier was largely forgotten for centuries but study of her has abounded in recent decades. She is remembered for contributing to English literature her volume of verses Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum for which she is seen as the first professional female poet in the English language. Indeed she is known as one of Englands first feminist writers in any form and potentially as the dark lady of Shakespearean myth. The play Emilia by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm produced in London in 2018 is a mock history piece with a feminist message in which Lanier rebukes Shakespeare for lift her words. Montserrat Lombard portrays Emilia Lanier in a recurring role on the BBC Two series Upstart Crow from 2016 to 2018. A musical The Dark Lady by Sophie Boyce and Veronica Mansour is currently in development depicting the what if scenario whereby Emilia uses William Shakespeares name in order to have her plays seen. The musical was recently developed at the Eugene ONeill Theater Center with a cast of Broadway and Off-Broadway favourites. Lanier appears as a character in the 2019 video game Astrologaster. Lanier is the central character of the novel The Heavens by Sandra Newman. She is also referred to throughout the Practical Magic series by Alice Hoffman. Lisa Mordente was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance as Lainer in Marlowe on Broadway in 1981. 
Ben Jonson,Benjamin Jonson was an English playwright and poet. Jonsons artistry exerted a lasting influence upon English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the comedy of humours; he is best known for the satirical plays Every Man in His Humour Volpone or The Fox The Alchemist and Bartholomew Fair and for his lyric and epigrammatic poetry. He is generally regarded as the second most important English dramatist after William Shakespeare during the reign of James I. Jonson was a classically educated well-read and cultured man of the English Renaissance with an appetite for controversy whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the Jacobean era and of the Caroline era . In midlife Jonson said his paternal grandfather who served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman was a member of the extended Johnston family of Annandale in the Dumfries and Galloway a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles in the Jonson family coat of arms one spindle is a diamond-shaped heraldic device used by the Johnston family. His ancestors spelled the family name with a letter t . While the spelling had eventually changed to the more common Johnson the playwrights own particular preference became Jonson. Jonsons father lost his property was imprisoned and as a Protestant suffered forfeiture under Queen Mary. Becoming a clergyman upon his release he died a month before his sons birth. His widow married a master bricklayer two years later. Jonson attended school in St Martins Lane in London. Later a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School where the antiquarian historian topographer and officer of arms William Camden was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends and the intellectual influence of Camdens broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonsons art and literary style remained notable until Camdens death in 1623. At Westminster School he met the Welsh poet Hugh Holland with whom he established an enduring relationship. Both of them would write preliminary poems for William Shakespeares First Folio . On leaving Westminster School in 1589 Jonson was to have attended the University of Cambridge to continue his book learning but did not because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather. According to the churchman and historian Thomas Fuller Jonson at this time built a garden wall in Lincolns Inn. After having been an apprentice bricklayer Jonson went to the Netherlands and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Sir Francis Vere in Flanders. England was allied with the Dutch in their fight for independence as well as the ongoing war with Spain. The Hawthornden Manuscripts of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden report that when in Flanders Jonson engaged fought and killed an enemy soldier in single combat and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier. After his military activity on the Continent Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor he was the protagonist Hieronimo in the play The Spanish Tragedy by Thomas Kyd the first revenge tragedy in English literature. By 1597 he was a working playwright employed by Philip Henslowe the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year the production of Every Man in His Humour had established Jonsons reputation as a dramatist. Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as a shrew yet honest. The identity of Jonsons wife is obscure though she sometimes is identified as Ann Lewis the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594 at the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr near London Bridge. The registers of St Martin-in-the-Fields record that Mary Jonson their eldest daughter died in November 1593 at six months of age. A decade later in 1603 Benjamin Jonson their eldest son died of bubonic plague when he was seven years old upon which Jonson wrote the elegiac On My First Sonne . A second son also named Benjamin Jonson died in 1635. During that period Jonson and his wife lived separate lives for five years; Jonson enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons Esme Stuart 3rd Duke of Lennox and 7th Seigneur dAubigny and Sir Robert Townshend. By summer 1597 Jonson had a fixed engagement in the Admirals Men then performing under Philip Henslowes management at The Rose.John Aubrey reports on uncertain authority that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor he was evidently more valuable to the company as a writer. By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admirals Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by Francis Meres in his Palladis Tamia as one of the best for tragedy. None of his early tragedies survive however. An undated comedy The Case is Altered may be his earliest surviving play. In 1597 a play which he co-wrote with Thomas Nashe The Isle of Dogs was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen Elizabeth Is so-called interrogator Richard Topcliffe. Jonson was jailed in Marshalsea Prison and charged with Leude and mutynous behaviour while Nashe managed to escape to Great Yarmouth. Two of the actors Gabriel Spenser and Robert Shaw were also imprisoned. A year later Jonson was again briefly imprisoned this time in Newgate Prison for killing Gabriel Spenser in a duel on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields . Tried on a charge of manslaughter Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by benefit of clergy a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse forfeiting his goods and chattels and being branded with the so called Tyburn T on his left thumb. While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father Thomas Wright a Jesuit priest. In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success Every Man in His Humour capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which George Chapman had begun with An Humorous Days Mirth. William Shakespeare was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with Every Man out of His Humour a pedantic attempt to imitate Aristophanes. It is not known whether this was a success on stage but when published it proved popular and went through several editions. Jonsons other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth Is reign was marked by fighting and controversy. Cynthias Revels was produced by the Children of the Chapel Royal at Blackfriars Theatre in 1600. It satirised both John Marston who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in Histriomastix and Thomas Dekker. Jonson attacked the two poets again in Poetaster . Dekker responded with Satiromastix subtitled the untrussing of the humorous poet. The final scene of this play whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummonds report boasting about himself and condemning other poets criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way. This War of the Theatres appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming James I to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated The Malcontent to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on Eastward Ho a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail. At the beginning of the English reign of James VI and I in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for masques and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consortAnne of Denmark. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as Elizabeth Sidney and Lady Mary Wroth. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonsons most famous lyrics the country house poem To Penshurst. In February 1603 John Manningham reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend son of Sir Roger Townshend and scorns the world. Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the Privy Council about Sejanus a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play now lost in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities displeasure at the work in the second week of October 1605 he was present at a supper party attended by most of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. After the plots discovery he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator Robert Cecil and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright who heard Fawkess confession was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council as a witness. At the same time Jonson pursued a more prestigious career writing masques for Jamess court. The Satyr and The Masque of Blackness are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne some of them performed at Apethorpe Palace when the King was in residence. The Masque of Blackness was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre which mingled speech dancing and spectacle. On many of these projects he collaborated not always peacefully with designer Inigo Jones. For example Jones designed the scenery for Jonsons masque Oberon the Faery Prince performed at Whitehall on 1 January 1611 in which Prince Henry eldest son of James I appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together. In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 marks leading some to identify him as Englands first Poet Laureate. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year. Other volumes followed in 164041 and 1692.  On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh arriving in Scotlands capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the great north road and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses. On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart a cousin of King James in Leith and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September. He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619 and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet William Drummond of Hawthornden sited on the River Esk. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonsons conversation as he could in his diary and thus recorded aspects of Jonsons personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions in Drummonds terse reporting in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was a great lover and praiser of himself a contemner and scorner of others. On returning to England he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University. The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonsons heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based including the tragedy Catiline which achieved limited success and the comedies Volpone Epicoene or the Silent Woman The Alchemist Bartholomew Fair and The Devil Is an Ass .The Alchemist and Volpone were immediately successful. Of Epicoene Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the plays subtitle was appropriate since its audience had refused to applaud the play . Yet Epicoene along with Bartholomew Fair and The Devil is an Ass have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s his financial security was still not assured. Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous Protestant landowner until the reign of Bloody Mary and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarchs attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On Elizabeths accession he had been freed and had been able to travel to London to become a clergyman. Jonsons elementary education was in a small church school attached to St Martin-in-the-Fields parish and at the age of about seven he secured a place at Westminster School then part of Westminster Abbey. Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying he converted to the faith. This took place in October 1598 while Jonson was on remand in Newgate Gaol charged with manslaughter. Jonsons biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright a Jesuit priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeths right to rule in England. Wright although placed under house arrest on the orders of Lord Burghley was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons. It may have been that Jonson fearing that his trial would go against him was seeking the unequivocal absolution that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death. Alternatively he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wrights protector the Earl of Essex was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch. Jonsons conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession from the childless Elizabeth had not been settled and Essexs Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne. Conviction and certainly not expedience alone sustained Jonsons faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play Sejanus His Fall was banned for popery and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut. In January 1606 he appeared before the Consistory Court in London to answer a charge of recusancy with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to seduce citizens to the cause. This was a serious matter but he explained that his failure to take communion was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament a common routine at the timeindeed it was one followed by the royal consort Queen Anne of Denmark herselfto show political loyalty while not offending the conscience. Leading church figures including John Overall Dean of St Pauls were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism but these overtures were resisted. In May 1610 Henry IV of France was assassinated purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonsons decision to rejoin the Church of England. He did this in flamboyant style pointedly drinking a full chalice of communion wine at the eucharist to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite in which the priest alone drinks the wine. The exact date of the ceremony is unknown. However his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death. Jonsons productivity began to decline in the 1620s but he remained well known. In that time the Sons of Ben or the Tribe of Ben those younger poets such as Robert Herrick Richard Lovelace and Sir John Suckling who took their bearing in verse from Jonson rose to prominence. However a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest however for their portrayal of Charles Is England. The Staple of News for example offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was however nothing compared to the dismal failure of The New Inn; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience which in turn prompted Thomas Carew one of the Tribe of Ben to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline. The principal factor in Jonsons partial eclipse was however the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his fathers day he increased Jonsons annual pension to 100 and included a tierce of wine and beer. Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play The Sad Shepherd. Though only two acts are extant this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson a move into pastoral drama. During the early 1630s he also conducted a correspondence with James Howell who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones. Jonson died on or around 16 August 1637 and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town. He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey with the inscription O Rare Ben Johnson set in the slab over his grave.John Aubrey in a more meticulous record than usual notes that a passer-by John Young of Great Milton Oxfordshire saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from William Davenant Jonsons successor as Poet Laureate as the same phrase appears on Davenants nearby gravestone but essayist Leigh Hunt contends that Davenants wording represented no more than Youngs coinage cheaply re-used. The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space. It has been pointed out that the inscription could be read Orare Ben Jonson possibly in an allusion to Jonsons acceptance of Catholic doctrine during his lifetime ; the carving shows a distinct space between O and rare. A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbeys Poets Corner. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the English Civil War intervened. Apart from two tragedies Sejanus and Catiline that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences Jonsons work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays particularly those written for boy players present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poets War he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts however plot mostly takes second place to variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are also notably ill-tempered. Thomas Davies called Poetaster a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic where the names of Augustus Caesar Maecenas Virgil Horace Ovid and Tibullus are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment. Another early comedy in a different vein The Case is Altered is markedly similar to Shakespeares romantic comedies in its foreign setting emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowes diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated. The comedies of his middle career from Eastward Hoe to The Devil Is an Ass are for the most part city comedy with a London setting themes of trickery and money and a distinct moral ambiguity despite Jonsons professed aim in the Prologue to Volpone to mix profit with your pleasure. His late plays or dotages particularly The Magnetic Lady and The Sad Shepherd exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of Elizabethan comedy. Within this general progression however Jonsons comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the folio version of Every Man in His Humour he promises to represent deeds and language such as men do use. He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theoryor rather since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from Plautus and Terence he intended to apply those premises with rigour. This commitment entailed negations after The Case is Altered Jonson eschewed distant locations noble characters romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of new comedy. He set his plays in contemporary settings peopled them with recognisable types and set them to actions that if not strictly realistic involved everyday motives such as greed and jealousy. In accordance with the temper of his age he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the farcical . He was more diligent in adhering to the classical unities than many of his peersalthough as Margaret Cavendish noted the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonsons abundance of incident. To this classical model Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge for instance claimed that The Alchemist had one of the three most perfect plots in literature. Jonsons poetry like his drama is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the humanist manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as Thomas Campion and Gabriel Harvey. Accepting both rhyme and stress Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity restraint and precision. Underwood published in the expanded folio of 1640 is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains A Celebration of Charis Jonsons most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; encomiastic poems including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on Mary Wroth; the Execration against Vulcan and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne . There are many legends about Jonsons rivalry with Shakespeare. William Drummond reports that during their conversation Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeares plays a nonsensical line in Julius Caesar and the setting of The Winters Tale on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare wanted art . In De Shakespeare Nostrat in Timber which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was Would he had blotted a thousand However Jonson explains Hee was honest and of an open and free nature had an excellent Phantsie; brave notions and gentle expressions wherein hee flowd with that facility that sometime it was necessary he should be stoppd. Jonson concludes that there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned. When Shakespeare died he said He was not of an age but for all time. Thomas Fuller relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the Mermaid Tavern; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt not only because of the tone of Jonsons references to him but because Shakespeares company produced a number of Jonsons plays at least two of which Shakespeare certainly acted in. However it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated. Jonsons most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeares First Folio. This poem To the Memory of My Beloved the Author Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who despite small Latine and lesse Greeke had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself the disciplined and erudite classicist scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses and Shakespeare represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the Sweet Swan of Avon the Soul of the Age It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwrights works a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions in a relatively complete form. Jonson was a towering literary figure and his influence was enormous for he has been described as One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature. Before the English Civil War the Tribe of Ben touted his importance and during the Restoration Jonsons satirical comedies and his theory and practice of humour characters was extremely influential providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. John Aubrey wrote of Jonson in Brief Lives. By 1700 Jonsons status began to decline. In the Romantic era Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare as the taste for Jonsons type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein. In 2012 after more than two decades of research Cambridge University Press published the first new edition of Jonsons complete works for 60 years. As G. E. Bentley notes in Shakespeare and Jonson Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared Jonsons reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeares in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the Restoration of Charles II Jonsons work along with Shakespeares and Fletchers formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeares plays were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among English Renaissance dramatists. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces in Timber and in his scattered prefaces and dedications the realism and propriety of his language the bite of his satire and the care with which he plotted his comedies. For some critics the temptation to contrast Jonson with Shakespeare has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio and Samuel Butler drew the same comparison in his commonplace book later in the century. At the Restoration this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. Charles de Saint-Évremond placed Jonsons comedies above all else in English drama and Charles Gildon called Jonson the father of English comedy. John Dryden offered a more common assessment in the Essay of Dramatic Poesie in which his Avatar Neander compares Shakespeare to Homer and Jonson to Virgil the former represented profound creativity the latter polished artifice. But artifice was in the 17th century almost synonymous with art; Jonson for instance used artificer as a synonym for artist . For Lewis Theobald too Jonson ow all his Excellence to his Art in contrast to Shakespeare the natural genius. Nicholas Rowe to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of Every Man in his Humour to Shakespeares intercession likewise attributed Jonsons excellence to learning which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonsons learned art; for instance in the 1750s Edward Young casually remarked on the way in which Jonsons learning worked like Samsons strength to his own detriment. Earlier Aphra Behn writing in defence of female playwrights had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies with their lengthy speeches abstracted from Sallust and Cicero Augustan critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his aesthetic judgment. In this period Alexander Pope is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable as that because Ben Jonson had much the most learning it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy it was retorted on the other that Jonson wanted both. For the most part the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s Sarah Fielding could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a man of sense encountered by David Simple. Though his stature declined during the 18th century Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg translated parts of Peter Whalleys edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution Edward Capell offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet who has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius. The disastrous failures of productions of Volpone and Epicoene in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as Earl Camden and William Gifford he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century. The romantic revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonsons laborious caution. Coleridge while more respectful describes Jonson as psychologically superficial He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to and likely to impress the senses. Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson whose reputation had survived appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as Thomas Middleton or John Heywood who were in some senses discoveries of the 19th century. Moreover the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art lowered Jonsons status if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal however; William Gifford Jonsons first editor of the 19th century did a great deal to defend Jonsons reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era Swinburne who was more interested in Jonson than most Victorians wrote The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers they have colour form variety fertility vigour the one thing they want is fragrance by fragrance Swinburne means spontaneity. In the 20th century Jonsons body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in The Sacred Wood T. S. Eliot attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonsons overall conception and his surface a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century a number of critics and scholars followed Eliots lead producing detailed studies of Jonsons verbal style. At the same time study of Elizabethan themes and conventions such as those by E. E. Stoll and M. C. Bradbrook provided a more vivid sense of how Jonsons work was shaped by the expectations of his time. The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonsons artistry. On the other hand Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonsons career eventually made him a focal point for the revived sociopolitical criticism. Jonsons works particularly his masques and pageants offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover his career at the centre of Londons emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of patronage and in the rising culture of mass media. Jonson has been called the first poet laureate. If Jonsons reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare his reputation as a poet has since the early 20th century been linked to that of John Donne. In this comparison Jonson represents the cavalier strain of poetry emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne by contrast epitomised the metaphysical school of poetry with its reliance on strained baroque metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison were to varying extents rediscovering Donne this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonsons reputation. In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623 historian Edmund Bolton named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the father of cavalier poets are clear many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his sons or his tribe. For some of this tribe the connection was as much social as poetic; Herrick described meetings at the Sun the Dog the Triple Tunne. All of them including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonsons took inspiration from Jonsons revival of classical forms and themes his subtle melodies and his disciplined use of wit. In these respects Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English neoclassicism. The best of Jonsons lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically they experience a brief vogue as after the publication of Peter Whalleys edition of 1756. Jonsons poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history such as politics systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader Jonsons reputation rests on a few lyrics that though brief are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonsons plays. It is in Jonsons Timber or Discoveries... that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer Language most shows a man Speak that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us and is the image of the parent of it the mind. No glass renders a mans form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man so words in language; in the greatness aptness sound structure and harmony of it. As with other English Renaissance dramatists a portion of Ben Jonsons literary output has not survived. In addition to The Isle of Dogs the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonsons work Richard Crookback ; Hot Anger Soon Cold with Porter and Henry Chettle; Page of Plymouth with Dekker; and Robert II King of Scots with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonsons masques and entertainments also are not extant The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors ; The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I ; and The May Lord . Finally there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in Rollo Duke of Normandy or The Bloody Brother a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy The Widow was printed in 1652 as the work of Thomas Middleton Fletcher and Jonson though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonsons presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays such as The London Prodigal have been ventured by individual researchers but have met with cool responses.
Thomas Hobbes,Thomas Hobbes was an English philosopher. Hobbes is best known for his 1651 book Leviathan in which he expounds an influential formulation of social contract theory. In addition to political philosophy Hobbes contributed to a diverse array of other fields including history jurisprudence geometry theology and ethics as well as philosophy in general. He is considered to be one of the founders of modern political philosophy. Hobbes was born and raised in Malmesbury and attended Oxford University before graduating from Cambridge University in 1608. He then became a tutor to the Cavendish family. After returning to England from France in 1641 Hobbes witnessed the destruction and brutality of the English Civil War from 1642 to 1651 between Parliamentarians and Royalists which heavily influenced his advocacy for governance by an absolute sovereign in Leviathan. Aside from social contract theory Leviathan also popularized ideas such as the state of nature and laws of nature. His other major works include the trilogy De Cive De Corpore and De Homine as well as the posthumous work Behemoth . Thomas Hobbes was born on 5 April 1588 in Westport now part of Malmesbury in Wiltshire England. Having been born prematurely when his mother heard of the coming invasion of the Spanish Armada Hobbes later reported that my mother gave birth to twins myself and fear. Hobbes had a brother Edmund about two years older as well as a sister Anne. Although Thomas Hobbess childhood is unknown to a large extent as is his mothers name it is known that Hobbess father Thomas Sr. was the vicar of both Charlton and Westport. Hobbess father was uneducated according to John Aubrey Hobbess biographer and he disesteemed learning. Thomas Sr. was involved in a fight with the local clergy outside his church forcing him to leave London. As a result the family was left in the care of Thomas Sr.s older brother Francis a wealthy glove manufacturer with no family of his own. Hobbes Jr. was educated at Westport church from age four passed to the Malmesbury school and then to a private school kept by a young man named Robert Latimer a graduate of the University of Oxford. Hobbes was a good pupil and between 1601 and 1602 he went up to Magdalen Hall the predecessor to Hertford College Oxford where he was taught scholastic logic and mathematics. The principal John Wilkinson was a Puritan and had some influence on Hobbes. Before going up to Oxford Hobbes translated Euripides Medea from Greek into Latin verse. At university Thomas Hobbes appears to have followed his own curriculum as he was little attracted by the scholastic learning. Leaving Oxford Hobbes completed his B.A. degree by incorporation at St Johns College Cambridge in 1608. He was recommended by Sir James Hussey his master at Magdalen as tutor to William the son of William CavendishBaron of Hardwick and began a lifelong connection with that family. William Cavendish was elevated to the peerage on his fathers death in 1626 holding it for two years before his death in 1628. His son also William likewise became the 3rd Earl of Devonshire. Hobbes served as a tutor and secretary to both men. The 1st Earls younger brother Charles Cavendish had two sons who were patrons of Hobbes. The elder son William Cavendish later 1st Duke of Newcastle was a leading supporter of Charles I during the civil war personally financing an army for the king having been governor to the Prince of Wales Charles James Duke of Cornwall. It was to this William Cavendish that Hobbes dedicated his Elements of Law. Hobbes became a companion to the younger William Cavendish and they both took part in a grand tour of Europe between 1610 and 1615. Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour in contrast to the scholastic philosophy that he had learned in Oxford. In Venice Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio an associate of Paolo Sarpi a Venetian scholar and statesman. His scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classic Greek and Latin authors the outcome of which was in 1628 his great translation of Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War the first translation of that work into English from a Greek manuscript. It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as Horae Subsecivae Observations and Discourses also represent the work of Hobbes from this period. Although he did associate with literary figures like Ben Jonson and briefly worked as Francis Bacons amanuensis translating several of his Essays into Latin he did not extend his efforts into philosophy until after 1629. In June 1628 his employer Cavendish then the Earl of Devonshire died of the plague and his widow the countess Christian dismissed Hobbes. Hobbes soon found work as a tutor to Gervase Clifton the son of Sir Gervase Clifton 1st Baronet mostly spent in Paris until November 1630. Thereafter he again found work with the Cavendish family tutoring William Cavendish 3rd Earl of Devonshire the eldest son of his previous pupil. Over the next seven years as well as tutoring he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates. He visited Galileo Galilei in Florence while he was under house arrest upon condemnation in 1636 and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris held together by Marin Mersenne. Hobbess first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum. Despite his interest in this phenomenon he disdained experimental work as in physics. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out in a separate treatise a systematic doctrine of body showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants. Then in another treatise he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation knowledge affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally he considered in his crowning treatise how Men were moved to enter into society and argued how this must be regulated if people were not to fall back into brutishness and misery. Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body Man and the State. Hobbes came back home from Paris in 1637 to a country riven with discontent which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan. However by the end of the Short Parliament in 1640 he had written a short treatise called The Elements of Law Natural and Politic. It was not published and only circulated as a manuscript among his acquaintances. A pirated version however was published about ten years later. Although it seems that much of The Elements of Law was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis. Nevertheless many elements of Hobbess political thought were unchanged between The Elements of Law and Leviathan which demonstrates that the events of the English Civil War had little effect on his contractarian methodology. However the arguments in Leviathan were modified from The Elements of Law when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation Hobbes wrote in The Elements of Law that Patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the consent of the governed while in Leviathan he argued that they were. This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbess thoughts about the engagement controversy or of his reaction to treatises published by Patriarchalists such as Sir Robert Filmer between 1640 and 1651. When in November 1640 the Long Parliament succeeded the Short Hobbes felt that he was in disfavour due to the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris. He did not return for 11 years. In Paris he rejoined the coterie around Mersenne and wrote a critique of the Meditations on First Philosophy of Descartes which was printed as third among the sets of Objections appended with Replies from Descartes in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two. Hobbes also extended his own works in a way working on the third section De Cive which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately it was well received and included lines of argumentation that were repeated a decade later in Leviathan. He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except a short treatise on optics included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as Cogitata physico-mathematica in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes Gilles de Roberval and others to referee the controversy between John Pell and Longomontanus over the problem of squaring the circle. The English Civil War began in 1642 and when the royalist cause began to decline in mid-1644 many royalists came to Paris and were known to Hobbes. This revitalised Hobbess political interests and the De Cive was republished and more widely distributed. The printing began in 1646 by Samuel de Sorbiere through the Elsevier press in Amsterdam with a new preface and some new notes in reply to objections. In 1647 Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young Charles Prince of Wales who had come to Paris from Jersey around July. This engagement lasted until 1648 when Charles went to Holland. The company of the exiled royalists led Hobbes to produce Leviathan which set forth his theory of civil government in relation to the political crisis resulting from the war. Hobbes compared the State to a monster composed of men created under pressure of human needs and dissolved by civil strife due to human passions. The work closed with a general Review and Conclusion in response to the war which answered the question Does a subject have the right to change allegiance when a former sovereigns power to protect is irrevocably lost During the years of composing Leviathan Hobbes remained in or near Paris. In 1647 he suffered a near-fatal illness that disabled him for six months. On recovering he resumed his literary task and completed it by 1650. Meanwhile a translation of De Cive was being produced; scholars disagree about whether it was Hobbes who translated it. In 1650 a pirated edition of The Elements of Law Natural and Politic was published. It was divided into two small volumes Human Nature or the Fundamental Elements of Policie; and De corpore politico or the Elements of Law Moral and Politick. In 1651 the translation of De Cive was published under the title Philosophical Rudiments concerning Government and Society. Also the printing of the greater work proceeded and finally appeared in mid-1651 titled Leviathan or the Matter Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiastical and Civil. It had a famous title-page engraving depicting a crowned giant above the waist towering above hills overlooking a landscape holding a sword and a crozier and made up of tiny human figures. The work had immediate impact. Soon Hobbes was more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time. The first effect of its publication was to sever his link with the exiled royalists who might well have killed him. The secularist spirit of his book greatly angered both Anglicans and French Catholics. Hobbes appealed to the revolutionary English government for protection and fled back to London in winter 1651. After his submission to the Council of State he was allowed to subside into private life in Fetter Lane. In 1658 Hobbes published the final section of his philosophical system completing the scheme he had planned more than 20 years before. De Homine consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision. The remainder of the treatise dealt cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the Human Nature and the Leviathan. In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics including disciplines like geometry Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works. From the time of the Restoration he acquired a new prominence; Hobbism became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce. The young king Hobbess former pupil now Charles II remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of 100. The king was important in protecting Hobbes when in 1666 the House of Commons introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness. That same year on 17 October 1666 it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism blasphemy and profaneness... in particular... the book of Mr. Hobbes called the Leviathan. Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers. At the same time he examined the actual state of the law of heresy. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an Appendix to his Latin translation of Leviathan published in Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix Hobbes aimed to show that since the High Court of Commission had been put down there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the Nicene Creed which he maintained Leviathan did not do. The only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct. The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censors licence for its publication in England. Other writings were not made public until after his death including Behemoth the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662. For some time Hobbes was not even allowed to respond whatever his enemies tried. Despite this his reputation abroad was formidable. Hobbes spent the last four or five years of his life with his patron William Cavendish 1st Duke of Devonshire at the familys Chatsworth House estate. He had been a friend of the family since 1608 when he first tutored an earlier William Cavendish. After Hobbess death many of his manuscripts would be found at Chatsworth House. His final works were an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672 and a translation of four books of the Odyssey into rugged English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both Iliad and Odyssey in 1675. In October 1679 Hobbes suffered a bladder disorder and then a paralytic stroke from which he died on 4 December 1679 aged 91at Hardwick Hall owned by the Cavendish family. His last words were said to have been A great leap in the dark uttered in his final conscious moments. His body was interred in St John the Baptists Church Ault Hucknall in Derbyshire. Hobbes influenced by contemporary scientific ideas had intended for his political theory to be a quasi-geometrical system in which the conclusions followed inevitably from the premises. The main practical conclusion of Hobbess political theory is that state or society cannot be secure unless at the disposal of an absolute sovereign. From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent. This particular view owes its significance to it being first developed in the 1630s when Charles I had sought to raise revenues without the consent of Parliament and therefore of his subjects. Hobbes rejected one of the most famous theses of Aristotles politics namely that human beings are naturally suited to life in a polis and do not fully realize their natures until they exercise the role of citizen. In Leviathan Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality. Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war. Beginning from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government a condition which he calls the state of nature. In that state each person would have a right or license to everything in the world. This Hobbes argues would lead to a war of all against all . The description contains what has been called one of the best-known passages in English philosophy which describes the natural state humankind would be in were it not for political community In such condition there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man solitary poor nasty brutish and short. In such states people fear death and lack both the things necessary to commodious living and the hope of being able to obtain them. So in order to avoid it people accede to a social contract and establish a civil society. According to Hobbes society is a population and a sovereign authority to whom all individuals in that society cede some right for the sake of protection. Power exercised by this authority cannot be resisted because the protectors sovereign power derives from individuals surrendering their own sovereign power for protection. The individuals are thereby the authors of all decisions made by the sovereign he that complaineth of injury from his sovereign complaineth that whereof he himself is the author and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himself no nor himself of injury because to do injury to ones self is impossible. There is no doctrine of separation of powers in Hobbess discussion. According to Hobbes the sovereign must control civil military judicial and ecclesiastical powers even the words. In 1654 a small treatise Of Liberty and Necessity directed at Hobbes was published by Bishop John Bramhall. Bramhall a strong Arminian had met and debated with Hobbes and afterwards wrote down his views and sent them privately to be answered in this form by Hobbes. Hobbes duly replied but not for publication. However a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with an extravagantly laudatory epistle. Bramhall countered in 1655 when he printed everything that had passed between them . In 1656 Hobbes was ready with The Questions concerning Liberty Necessity and Chance in which he replied with astonishing force to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism Hobbess own two pieces were important in the history of the free-will controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with Castigations of Mr Hobbess Animadversions and also included a bulky appendix entitled The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale. Hobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements and assailed the system of the original universities in Leviathan. He went on to publish De Corpore which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics but also an erroneous proof of the squaring of the circle. This all led mathematicians to target him for polemics and sparked John Wallis to become one of his most persistent opponents. From 1655 the publishing date of De Corpore Hobbes and Wallis continued name-calling and bickering for nearly a quarter of a century with Hobbes failing to admit his error to the end of his life. After years of debate the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that it has become one of the most infamous feuds in mathematical history. The religious opinions of Hobbes remain controversial as many positions have been attributed to him and range from atheism to Orthodox Christianity. In the Elements of Law Hobbes provided a cosmological argument for the existence of God saying that God is the first cause of all causes. Hobbes was accused of atheism by several contemporaries; Bramhall accused him of teachings that could lead to atheism. This was an important accusation and Hobbes himself wrote in his answer to Bramhalls The Catching of Leviathan that atheism impiety and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible. Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations. In more recent times also much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and J. G. A. Pocock but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbess unusual views on religion. As Martinich has pointed out in Hobbess time the term atheist was often applied to people who believed in God but not in divine providence or to people who believed in God but also maintained other beliefs that were considered to be inconsistent with such belief or judged incompatible with orthodox Christianity. He says that this sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the early modern period. In this extended early modern sense of atheism Hobbes did take positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example he argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances and that all things including human thoughts and even God heaven and hell are corporeal matter in motion. He argued that though Scripture acknowledge spirits yet doth it nowhere say that they are incorporeal meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity. Like John Locke he also stated that true revelation can never disagree with human reason and experience although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign in order to avoid war. While in Venice on tour Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio a close associate of Paolo Sarpi who had written against the pretensions of the papacy to temporal power in response to the Interdict of Pope Paul V against Venice which refused to recognise papal prerogatives. James I had invited both men to England in 1612. Micanzio and Sarpi had argued that God willed human nature and that human nature indicated the autonomy of the state in temporal affairs. When he returned to England in 1615 William Cavendish maintained correspondence with Micanzio and Sarpi and Hobbes translated the latters letters from Italian which were circulated among the Dukes circle.

George Herbert,George Herbert was an English poet orator and priest of the Church of England. His poetry is associated with the writings of the metaphysical poets and he is recognised as one of the foremost British devotional lyricists. He was born in Wales into an artistic and wealthy family and largely raised in England. He received a good education that led to his admission to Trinity College Cambridge in 1609. He went there with the intention of becoming a priest but he became the Universitys Public Orator and attracted the attention of King James I. He sat in the Parliament of England in 1624 and briefly in 1625. After the death of King James Herbert renewed his interest in ordination. He gave up his secular ambitions in his mid-thirties and took holy orders in the Church of England spending the rest of his life as the rector of the rural parish of Fugglestone St Peter just outside Salisbury. He was noted for unfailing care for his parishioners bringing the sacraments to them when they were ill and providing food and clothing for those in need. Henry Vaughan called him a most glorious saint and seer. He was never a healthy man and died of consumption at age 39. George Herbert was born 3 April 1593 in Montgomery Montgomeryshire Wales the son of Richard Herbert and his wife Magdalen née Newport the daughter of Sir Richard Newport . He was one of 10 children. The Herbert family was wealthy and powerful in both national and local government and George was descended from the same stock as the Earls of Pembroke. His father was a member of parliament a justice of the peace and later served for several years as custos rotulorum of Montgomeryshire. His mother was a patron and friend of clergyman and poet John Donne and other poets writers and artists. As Georges godfather Donne stood in after Richard Herbert died when George was three years old. Herbert and his siblings were then raised by his mother who pressed for a good education for her children. Herberts eldest brother Edward became a soldier diplomat historian poet and philosopher whose religious writings led to his reputation as the father of English deism. Herberts younger brother was Sir Henry Herbert Master of the Revels to Kings Charles I and II. Herbert entered Westminster School at or around the age of 12 as a day pupil although later he became a residential scholar. He was admitted on a scholarship to Trinity College Cambridge in 1609 and graduated first with a Bachelors and then with a Masters degree in 1616 at the age of 23. Subsequently Herbert was elected a major fellow of his college and then appointed Reader in Rhetoric. In 1620 he stressed his fluency in Greek and Latin and attained election to the post of the Universitys Public Orator a position he held until 1627. In 1624 supported by his kinsman the 3rd Earl of Pembroke Herbert became a member of parliament representing Montgomery. While these positions normally presaged a career at court and King James I had shown him favour circumstances worked against Herbert the King died in 1625 and two influential patrons also died at about the same time. However his parliamentary career may have ended already because although a Mr Herbert is mentioned as a committee member the Commons Journal for 1625 never mentions Mr. George Herbert despite the preceding parliaments careful distinction. In short Herbert made a shift in his path away from the political future he had been pursuing and turned more fully toward a future in the church. Herbert was presented with the prebend of Leighton Bromswold in the Diocese of Lincoln in 1626 whilst he was still a don at Trinity College Cambridge but not yet ordained. He was not present at his institution as prebend and it is recorded that Peter Walker his clerk stood in as his proxy. In the same year his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and went to Little Gidding two miles down the road from Leighton Bromswold to found a small community. Herbert raised money to restore the neglected church building at Leighton. In 1628 or 1629 Herbert lodged at Dauntsey House in the north of Wiltshire the home of his stepfathers brother Henry Danvers and Henrys elderly widowed mother Elizabeth. A days ride to the south at Baynton in Edington lived the family of Henrys cousin Charles Danvers who is said to have had a desire for Herbert to marry his daughter Jane. It was arranged for Herbert and Jane to meet and they found mutual affection; Jane was ten years younger than George. They were married at Edington church on 5 March 1629. In 1629 Herbert decided to enter the priesthood and the next year was appointed rector of the rural parish of Fugglestone St Peter with Bemerton near Salisbury in Wiltshire about 75 miles south-west of London. He was responsible for two small churches the 13th-century parish church of St Peter at Fugglestone near Wilton and the 14th-century chapel of St Andrew at Bemerton closer to Salisbury at the other end of the parish. Here he lived preached and wrote poetry; he also helped to rebuild the Bemerton church and adjacent rectory out of his own funds. His appointment may have again been assisted by the Earl of Pembroke whose family seat at Wilton House lay close to Fugglestone church. While at Bemerton Herbert revised and added to his collection of poems entitled The Temple. He also wrote a guide to rural ministry entitled A Priest to the Temple or The County Parson His Character and Rule of Holy Life which he himself described as a Mark to aim at and which has remained influential to this day. Having married shortly before taking up his post he and his wife gave a home to three orphaned nieces. Together with their servants they crossed the lane for services in the small St Andrews church twice every day. Twice a week Herbert made the short journey into Salisbury to attend services at the cathedral and afterwards would make music with the cathedral musicians. Herberts time at Bemerton was short. Having suffered for most of his life from poor health in 1633 he died of consumption only three years after taking holy orders. Jane died in 1661. Herbert wrote poetry in English Latin and Greek. Shortly before his death he sent a literary manuscript to his friend Nicholas Ferrar reportedly telling him to publish the poems if he thought they might turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul otherwise to burn them. In 1633 all of his English poems were published in The Temple Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations with a preface by Ferrar. The book went through eight editions by 1690. According to Izaak Walton when Herbert sent the manuscript to Ferrar he said that he shall find in it a picture of the many spiritual conflicts that have passed between God and my soul before I could subject mine to the will of Jesus my Master. In this Herbert used the format of the poems to reinforce the theme he was trying to portray. Beginning with The Church Porch they proceed via The Altar to The Sacrifice and so onwards through the collection. All of Herberts surviving English poems are on religious themes and are characterised by directness of expression enlivened by original but apt conceits in which in the Metaphysical manner the likeness is of function rather than visual. In The Windows for example he compares a righteous preacher to glass through which Gods light shines more effectively than in his words. Commenting on his religious poetry later in the 17th century Richard Baxter said Herbert speaks to God like one that really believeth in God and whose business in the world is most with God. Heart-work and heaven-work make up his books.Helen Gardner later added head-work to this characterisation in acknowledgement of his intellectual vivacity. It has also been pointed out how Herbert uses puns and wordplay to convey the relationships between the world of daily reality and the world of transcendent reality that gives it meaning. The kind of word that functions on two or more planes is his device for making his poem an expression of that relationship. Visually too the poems are varied in such a way as to enhance their meaning with intricate rhyme schemes stanzas combining different line lengths and other ingenious formal devices. The most obvious examples are pattern poems like The Altar in which the shorter and longer lines are arranged on the page in the shape of an altar. The visual appeal is reinforced by the conceit of its construction from a broken stony heart representing the personal offering of himself as a sacrifice upon it. Built into this is an allusion to Psalm 5117 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart. In the case of Easter Wings the words were printed sideways on two facing pages so that the lines there suggest outspread wings. The words of the poem are paralleled between stanzas and mimic the opening and closing of the wings. In Herberts poems formal ingenuity is not an end in itself but is employed only as an auxiliary to its meaning. The formal devices employed to convey that meaning are wide in range. In his meditation on the passage Our life is hid with Christ in God the capitalised words My life is hid in him that is my treasure move across successive lines and demonstrate what is spoken of in the text. Opposites are brought together in Bitter-Sweet for the same purpose. Echo and variation are also common. The exclamations at the head and foot of each stanza in Sighs and Grones are one example. The diminishing truncated rhymes in Paradise are another. There is also an echo-dialogue after each line in Heaven other examples of which are found in the poetry of his brother Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Alternative rhymes are offered at the end of the stanzas in The Water-Course while the MaryArmy Anagram is represented in its title. In The Collar Joseph Summers argues Herbert goes so far as to use apparent formlessness as a formal and thematic device the poem contains all the elements of order in violent disorder until the end when the final four lines regularity restores the readers sense of the necessity of order. Once the taste for this display of Baroque wit had passed the satirist John Dryden was to dismiss it as so many means to torture one poor word ten thousand ways. Though Herbert remained esteemed for his piety the poetic skill with which he expressed his thought had to wait centuries to be admired again. Herberts only prose work A Priest to the Temple offers practical advice to rural clergy. In it he advises that things of ordinary use such as ploughs leaven or dances could be made to serve for lights even of Heavenly Truths. It was first published in 1652 as part of Herberts Remains or Sundry Pieces of That Sweet Singer Mr. George Herbert edited by Barnabas Oley. The first edition was prefixed with unsigned preface by Oley which was used as one of the sources for Izaak Waltons biography of Herbert first published in 1670. The second edition appeared in 1671 as A Priest to the Temple or the Country Parson with a new preface this time signed by Oley. Like many of his literary contemporaries Herbert was a collector of proverbs. His Outlandish Proverbs was published in 1640 listing over 1000 aphorisms in English but gathered from many countries . The collection included many sayings repeated to this day for example His bark is worse than his bite and Who is so deaf as he that will not hear These and an additional 150 proverbs were included in a later collection entitled Jacula Prudentum dated 1651 and published in 1652 as part of Oleys Herberts Remains. Herbert came from a musical family. His mother Magdalen Herbert was a friend of the composers William Byrd and John Bull and encouraged her childrens musical education; his brother Edward Herbert of Cherbury was a skilled lutenist and composer. George Herbert played the lute and viol and sett his own lyricks or sacred poems. Musical pursuits interested him all through his life and his biographer Izaak Walton records that he rose to play the lute during his final illness. Walton also gave it as his opinion that he composed such hymns and anthems as he and the angels now sing in heaven while Waltons friend Charles Cotton described him as a soul composed of harmonies. More than ninety of Herberts poems have been set for singing over the centuries some of them multiple times. In his own century there were settings of Longing by Henry Purcell and And art thou grieved by John Blow. Some forty were adapted for the Methodist hymnal by the Wesley brothers among them Teach me my God and King which found its place in one version or another in 223 hymnals. Another poem Let all the world in every corner sing was published in 103 hymnals of which one is a French version. Other languages into which his work has been translated for musical settings include Spanish Catalan and German. In the 20th century Vertue alone achieved ten settings one of them in French. Among leading modern composers who set his work were Edmund Rubbra who set Easter as the first of his Two songs for voice and string trio ; Ralph Vaughan Williams who used four by Herbert in Five Mystical Songs of which Easter was the first and Antiphon II the last; Robin Milford who used the original Fitzwilliam manuscripts setting of the second part of Easter for his cantata Easter Morning set in two parts for soprano soloist and choir of childrens or womens voices; Benjamin Britten and William Walton both of whom set Antiphon too; Ned Rorem who included one in his 10 poems for voice oboe and strings ; and Judith Weir whose 2005 choral work Vertue includes three poems by Herbert. The earliest portrait of George Herbert was engraved long after his death by Robert White for Waltons biography of the poet in 1674. Now in Londons National Portrait Gallery it served as basis for later engravings such as those by Whites apprentice John Sturt and by Henry Hoppner Meyer in 1829. Among later artistic commemorations is William Dyces oil painting of George Herbert at Bemerton in the Guildhall Art Gallery London. The poet is pictured in his riverside garden prayerbook in hand. Over the meadows is Salisbury Cathedral where he used to join in the musical evensong; his lute leans against a stone bench and against a tree a fishing rod is propped a reminder of his first biographer Isaac Walton. There is also a musical reference in Charles West Copes George Herbert and his mother which is in Gallery Oldham the mother points a poem out to him in a room that has a virginal in the background. Most representations of Herbert however are in stained glass windows of which there are several in churches and cathedrals. They include Westminster AbbeySalisbury Cathedral and All Saints Church Cambridge. His own St Andrews Church in Bemerton installed in 1934 a memorial window which he shares with Nicholas Ferrar. In addition there is a statue of Herbert in his canonical robes based in part on the Robert White portrait in a niche on the West Front of Salisbury Cathedral. In the liturgy Herbert is remembered in the Church of England and the Episcopal Church on 27 February; also on 1 March in for example the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America being the day of his death. There are various collects for the day of which one is based on his poem The Elixir Our God and King who called your servant George Herbert from the pursuit of worldly honors to be a pastor of souls a poet and a priest in your temple Give us grace we pray joyfully to perform the tasks you give us to do knowing that nothing is menial or common that is done for your sake ... Amen. The quote All may have if they dare try a glorious life or a grave from Herberts The Church Porch is inscribed on the outer wall of St. Johns Church Waterloo.
Henry Vaughan,Henry Vaughan was a Welsh metaphysical poet author and translator writing in English and a medical physician. His religious poetry appeared in Silex Scintillans in 1650 with a second part in 1655. In 1646 his Poems with the Tenth Satire of Juvenal Englished was published. Meanwhile he had been persuaded by reading the religious poet George Herbert to renounce idle verse. The prose Mount of Olives and Solitary Devotions show his authenticity and depth of convictions. Two more volumes of secular verse followed ostensibly without his sanction but it is his religious verse that has been acclaimed. He also translated short moral and religious works and two medical works in prose. In the 1650s he began a lifelong medical practice. Henry Vaughan was born at Newton by Usk in the Llansantffraed parish of Brecknockshire the eldest known child of Thomas Vaughan of Tretower and Denise Jenkin the only daughter and heir of David and Gwenllian Morgan of Llansantffraed. Vaughan had a twin brother Thomas Vaughan who became a philosopher and alchemist. Vaughan was kin to two powerful Welsh families one Catholic one Protestant. His paternal grandfather William owned Tretower Court. His paternal grandmother Frances was the natural daughter of Thomas Somerset who spent some 24 years in the Tower of London for adhering to Catholicism. As she survived into Vaughans boyhood there may have been some direct Catholic influence on his early nurturing. Vaughan shared ancestry with the Herbert family through the daughter of a famous Welsh knight Dafydd Gam slain at Agincourt the Davy Gam esquire of William Shakespeares Henry V. He is not known to have claimed kinship with George Herbert but may have been aware of the tie. Thomas Vaughan later remarked that English is a Language the Author was not born to. Both boys were sent to school under Matthew Herbert Rector of Llangattock to whom both wrote tributes. Matthew Herbert may have reinforced a devotion to church and monarchy the boys had learnt at home. Like several of Vaughans clerical acquaintances he later proved uncompromising during the interregnum. He was imprisoned his property was seized and he narrowly avoided banishment. The buttery books of Jesus College Oxford show Thomas Vaughan being admitted in May 1638. It is thought that Henry went up at the same time; Anthony Wood states He made his first entry into Jesus College in Michaelmas term 1638 aged 17 years. There is no clear record to establish Henrys residence or matriculation but the assumption of his association with Oxford supported by his inclusion in Athenae Oxoniensis is reasonable enough. Recent research in the Jesus College archives however suggests that Henry did not enter Jesus College before 1641 unless he did so in 1639 without matriculating or paying an admission fee and left before the record in the surviving buttery books resumes in December of that year. It has been suggested that Henry went to Oxford later after Thomas based on poems each wrote for a 1651 edition of the Comedies Tragi-Comedies with Other Poems of William Cartwright who had died in 1643. Thomas had clearly attended Cartwrights lectures which were a draw at the time When He did read how did we flock to hear Henry apparently had not as his poem Upon the poems and plays of the ever-memorable Mr William Cartwright begins with the words I did but see thee. This and the 1647 poem Upon Mr Fletchers plays are celebrations of Royalist volumes that implied a reaffirmation of Cavalier ideals and a gesture of defiance against the society which had repudiated them. As the Civil War developed Vaughan was recalled home from London initially to serve as a secretary to Sir Marmaduke Lloyd a chief justice on the Brecknockshire circuit and staunch royalist. Vaughan is thought to have served briefly in the Royalist army. On his return he began to practise medicine. By 1646 Vaughan had married Catherine Wise with whom he reared a son Thomas and three daughters Lucy Frances and Catherine. His courtship with his first wife is reflected in Upon the Priory Grove in his first volume of poetry Poems with the Tenth Satire of Juvenal Englished . After his first wifes death he married her sister Elizabeth probably in 1655. Vaughan took his literary inspiration from his native environment and chose the descriptive name Silurist derived from his homage to the Silures a Celtic tribe of pre-Roman south Wales that strongly resisted the Romans. The name reflects the love Vaughan felt for the Welsh mountains of his home in what is now part of the Brecon Beacons National Park and the River Usk valley where he spent most of his early and professional life. By 1647 Vaughan with his wife and children had chosen life in the countryside. This was the setting in which Vaughan wrote Olor Iscanus . However it was not published until 1651 over three years after it was written which presumably reflects some crisis in Vaughans life. During those years his grandfather William Vaughan died and he was evicted from his living in Llansantffraed. Vaughan later decried the publication having long ago condemned these poems to obscurity. Olor Iscanus is filled with odd words and similes that beg attention despite its dark and morbid cognitive appeal. It is founded on crises felt in Vaughans homeland Brecknockshire. No major battle was fought there in the Civil War but the effects of the war were deeply felt by him and his community. The Puritan Parliament visited misfortune ejecting Anglicans and Royalists. Vaughan also lost his home at that time. There is a marked difference in the atmosphere Vaughan attempts to convey in this work and in his most famous work Silex Scintillans. Olor Iscanus represents a specific period in Vaughans life which emphasises other secular writers and provides allusions to debt and happy living. A fervent topic of Vaughan throughout the poems is the Civil War and it reveals Vaughans somewhat paradoxical thinking which ultimately fails to show whether he took part or not. Vaughan states complete satisfaction at being clean of innocent blood but also provides seemingly eyewitness accounts of battles and his own soldiery. Although Vaughan is thought to have been a Royalist these poems express contempt for all current authority and show a lack of zeal for the Royalist cause. His poems generally reflect a sense of severe decline which may mean he lamented the effects of the war on the monarchy and society. His short poem The Timber ostensibly about a dead tree concludes thy strange resentment after death Means only those who broke in life thy peace. Olor Iscanus includes translations from the Latin of Ovid Boethius and the Polish poet Casimir Sarbiewski. It was not until the writing of Silex Scintillans that Vaughan received significant acclaim. The period shortly preceding the publication of the first volume of the work marked an important period of his life. Certain indications in the first volume and explicit statements in the preface to the second volume suggest that Vaughan suffered a prolonged sickness that inflicted much pain. Vaughan interprets this experience as an encounter with death that alerted him to a misspent youth. Vaughan believed he had been spared to make amends and start a new course not only in his life but in the literature he would produce. He described his previous work as foul and a contribution to corrupt literature. Perhaps the most notable mark of Vaughans conversion is how much it is credited to George Herbert. Vaughan claims he is the least of Herberts many pious converts. The influence of Herberts poetry has been widely noted with many of Vaughans works based on works by Herbert. It was during this period of Vaughans life around 1650 that he adopted the saying Moriendo revixi by dying I gain new life. The first volume of Silex Scintillans was followed by The Mount of Olives or Solitary Devotions a prose book of devotions providing prayers for various stages in the day for prayer in church and for other purposes. It appears as a companion volume to the Book of Common Prayer to which it alludes frequently although it had been outlawed under the Commonwealth. The work was also influenced by Lancelot Andrewess Preces Privatae and John Cosins Collection of Private Devotions .Flores Solitudinis contains translations from the Latin of two works by the Spanish Jesuit Juan Eusebio Nieremberg one by a 5th-century Bishop of Lyon Eucherius and by Paulinus of Nola of whom Vaughan wrote a prose life. Vaughan practised medicine perhaps as early as the 1640s. He attached to the second volume of Silex Scintillans a translation of Henry Nolliuss Hermetical Physick. He went on to produce a translation of Nolliuss The Chymists Key in 1657. Vaughan was much indebted to George Herbert who provided a model for his new-found spiritual life and literary career showing a spiritual quickening and the gift of gracious feeling derived from Herbert. Archbishop Trench took the view As a divine Vaughan may be inferior but as a poet he is certainly superior. Critics praise Vaughans use of literary elements. His monosyllables long-drawn alliterations and ability to compel the reader to rate him as more than the equal of George Herbert. Yet others say the two are not even comparable as Herbert is in fact the Master. While these commentators admit that Henry Vaughans use of words can be superior to Herberts they believe his poetry is in fact worse. Herberts superiority is said to rest on his profundity and consistency. Certainly Vaughan would have never written the way he did without Herberts posthumous direction. The explicit spiritual influence here is all but proclaimed in the preface to Silex Scintillans. The prose of Vaughan exemplifies this as well. For instance Herberts The Temple is often seen as the inspiration and model on which Vaughan created his work. Silex Scintillans is most often classed with this collection of Herberts as it borrows the same themes experience and beliefs. Herberts influence is evident in the shape and the spirituality of Vaughans poetry. For example the opening to Vaughans poem Unprofitableness How rich O Lord How fresh thy visits are recalls Herberts The Flower Another work of Vaughans that parallels Herbert is Mount of Olives for example in the passage Let sensual natures judge as they please but for my part I shall hold it no paradoxe to affirme there are no pleasures in the world. Some coloured griefes of blushing woes there are which look as clear as if they were true complexions; but it is very sad and tyred truth that they are but painted. This echoes Herberts Rose Critics have argued that Vaughan is enslaved to Herberts works using similar little tricks such as abrupt introductions and whimsical titles as a framework for his work and failing to learn from Herbert. Vaughan was said to be unable to know his limits and focus more on the intensity of the poem meanwhile losing the attention of his audience. Yet Alexander Grosart denies that Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments when the reader can see Vaughans true self where he shows naturalness immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some cases he draws observations from Herberts language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herberts work yet makes it unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his presentation. Herbert in The Temple often the source of comparison between the two writers lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with Vaughans attitude that the experience of reading is the best guide to his meanings so that he promoted no special reading method. At these times Vaughan shows himself different from any other poet. Much of the distinction comes from an apparent lack of sympathy with the world about him. His aloof appeal to his surroundings detaches him and displays his love of nature and mysticism. This in turn influenced later poets such as Wordsworth. His mind thinks in terms of a physical and spiritual world and the obscure relation between the two often moved to original unfamiliar remote places reflected in his poetry. He was loyal to the themes of the Anglican Church and religious festivals but found his true voice in the more mystical themes of eternity communion with the dead nature and childhood. He was a poet of revelation who used the Bible Nature and his own experience to illustrate his vision of eternity. This gives Vaughans poetry a particularly modern sound. Alliteration conspicuous in Welsh poetry is more commonly used by Vaughan than by most of his contemporaries in English noticeably in the opening to The Water-fall. Vaughan drew on personal loss in two well-known poems The World and They Are All Gone into the World of Light. Another The Retreat combines the theme of loss with the corruption of childhood which is yet another consistent theme of his. Vaughans new-found personal voice and persona are seen to result of the death of a younger brother. This is an example of an especially beautiful fragment of one of his poems entitled The World Henry Vaughan was acclaimed less in his lifetime than after his death on 23 April 1695 aged 74. He was buried in the churchyard of St Brides Llansantffraed Powys where he had spent most of his life. The grave is visited by enthusiasts and has been the inspiration for other poets including Siegfried SassoonRoland Mathias and Brian Morris. Vaughan is recognised as an example of a poet who can write both graceful and effective prose. He influenced the work of poets such as Wordsworth Tennyson and Siegfried Sassoon. The American science fiction writer Philip K. Dick also named Vaughan as a key influence. Several poems by Vaughan from Silex Scintillans have been set to music including
Katherine Philipps,Katherine or Catherine Philips also known as The Matchless Orinda was an Anglo-Welsh royalist poet translator and woman of letters. She achieved renown as a translator of Pierre Corneilles Pompée and Horace and for her editions of poetry after her death. She was highly regarded by many notable later writers including John Dryden and John Keats as being influential. Born in London Katherine was the daughter of John Fowler a Presbyterian cloth merchant of Bucklersbury near the river in the City of London and of Katherine Oxenbridge whose father worked in the medical profession. Katherine it seems had a strong memory and was intellectually advanced and was according to a cousin of hers able to read the Bible before the age of four. Additionally she acquired remarkable fluency in several languages. After her fathers death she moved to Wales with her newly married mother. She attended boarding school from 1640 to 1645 where she began to write verse within a circle of friends and to appreciate French romances and Cavalier plays from which she would later choose many of the pet names she gave to members of her Society of Friendship. This school run by a Mrs Salmon was in Hackney a hotbed of female education at the time. Philipps also broke with Presbyterian traditions in both religion and politics by becoming a member of the Church of England as well as an ardent admirer of the king and his policy. In 1647 when she was sixteen Katherine Fowler married Welsh Parliamentarian James Philipps. James Philipps age has been the subject of some dispute as he was long thought to be 54 years old on their wedding day thus making him 38 years Katherines senior. However it seems their recovered marriage certificate has since shown that James Philipps was actually only 24 years old at the time of their union. The couple had two children including a son named Hector who did not live past infancy. He was buried in London in 1655. Hectors death was the subject of some of her later poems such as Epitaph On Her Son H. P. At St. Syths Church and On the Death of my First and Dearest Childe. The Society of Friendship had its origins in the cult of Neoplatonic love imported from the continent in the 1630s by Charles Is French wife Henrietta Maria. Members adopted pseudonyms drawn from French pastoral romances of Cavalier dramas. Philipps dramatised in her Society of Friendship the ideals as well as the realities and tribulations of Platonic love. Thus the Society helped establish a literary standard for her generation and Orinda herself as a model for the female writers who followed her. Her home at the Priory Cardigan Wales became the centre of the Society of Friendship the members of which were known to one another by pastoral names Philipps was Orinda her husband Antenor and Sir Charles Cotterel Poliarchus. The Matchless Orinda as her admirers called her was regarded as the apostle of female friendship and inspired great respect. She was widely considered an exemplar of the ideal woman writer virtuous proper and chaste. She was frequently contrasted to the more daring Aphra Behn to the latters detriment. Her poems frequently occasional typically celebrate the refined pleasures of platonic love. Jeremy Taylor in 1659 dedicated to her his Discourse on the Nature Offices and Measures of Friendship and Cowley Henry Vaughan the Silurist the Earl of Roscommon and the Earl of Cork and Orrery all celebrated her talent. In 1662 she went to Dublin to pursue her husbands claim to certain Irish estates which due to her late fathers past monetary investments in the British military they were in danger of losing. There she completed a translation of Pierre Corneilles Pompée produced with great success in 1663 in the Smock Alley Theatre and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London under the title Pompey. Although other women had translated or written dramas her translation of Pompée broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage. In 1664 an edition of her poetry entitled Poems by the Incomparable Mrs. K.P. was published; this was an unauthorised edition that made several grievous errors. In March 1664 Philipps travelled to London with a nearly completed translation of Corneilles Horace but died of smallpox. She was buried in the church of St Benet Sherehog later destroyed in the Great Fire of London. After her death in 1667 an authorised edition of her poetry was printed entitled Poems by the Most Deservedly Admired Mrs. Katherine Philips the Matchless Orinda. The edition included her translations of Pompée and Horace. Edward Phillips nephew of John Milton placed Katherine Philipps high above Aphra Behn writing in Theatrum poetarum a list of the chief poets of all ages and countries that she was the most applauded...Poetess of our Nation. The literary atmosphere of her circle is preserved in the excellent Letters of Orinda to Poliarchus published by Bernard Lintot in 1705 and 1709. Poliarchus was master of the ceremonies at the court of the Restoration and afterwards translated the romances of La Calprenède. Philipps had two children one of whom Katharine became the wife of a Lewis Wogan of Boulston Pembrokeshire. According to Gosse Philipps may have been the author of a volume of Female Poems ... written by Ephelia which are in the style of Orinda though other scholars have not embraced this attribution. Philippss translations and poems consider questions of political authority and express her royalist beliefs. Her work also considers the nature and value of friendship between women. There has been speculation over whether her work could be described as lesbian. Certainly her representations of female friendship are intense even passionate. She herself always insisted on their platonic nature and characterises her relationships as the meeting of souls as in these lines from To my Excellent Lucasia on our Friendship For as a watch by art is woundTo motion such was mine;But never had Orinda foundA soul till she found thine;Which now inspires cures and suppliesAnd guides my darkened breast;For thou art all that I can prizeMy joy my life my rest.  Harriette Andreadis has argued that her manipulations of the conventions of male poetic discourse constitute a form of lesbian writing. However there are many critics who do not believe Philippss poetry is indicative of her sexuality. For example in discussing To the Excellent Lucasia Mark Llewellyn argues that the image portrayed by the speaker is stripped of all sensual appetite could become the pathway to apprehension of and eventually mystic union with divine love and beauty . Andreadis says friendship here is no less than the mingling of souls the intimacy of hearts joined in secret and holding each others secrets sublimely elevating the friends to such ecstasies that they pity the mundane pleasures and powers of worldly rulers . Upon the Double Murder of King Charles is a more politically minded piece than many of her others from this time period although she is often associated with a class of poets termed Royalist or Cavalier poets noting their political sympathy to the Royalist cause those who supported the monarchy of King Charles I of England during the English Civil War and the following English Interregnum. She inspired the figure of Orinda elderly widow hypersensitive to matters of love and she herself a victim of love for a woman in the Italian tragedy of 1671 Il Cromuele written by Girolamo Graziani set in England during the Civil War. The original speaker on opening night failed to mention specific details to the play which are in the script in this opening allowing the audience to assume the text could be directed at the current political affairs. There are rumours that Phillips was either in the audience or could have even been an actress in the play herself. There has been speculation among critics over Katherine Philipps sexuality specifically regarding the relationships she shared with some of her female friends. Literary critics have often highlighted suggestions of female intimacy and eroticism within Philipps work. In fact many of her poems were written for or about fellow Society of Friendship members Anne Owen and Mary Aubrey who went by the names of Lucasia and Rosania respectively. A series of letters exchanged by Philipps and her friend Sir Charles Cotterell between 6 December 1661 and 17 May 1664 were recovered and published in 1705 under the title Letters from Orinda to Poliarchus. Hints of Philipps affection for Owen can be found throughout this correspondence notably within an exchange referring to Philipps attempt to convince Owen to marry Sir Charles in order to keep her nearby as Owen was engaged at the time and planned to move to Dublin with one Marcus Trevor. This attempt would ultimately prove unsuccessful.
John Milton,John Milton was an English poet and intellectual. His 1667 epic poem Paradise Lost written in blank verse and including over ten chapters was written in a time of immense religious flux and political upheaval. It addressed the fall of man including the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and Gods expulsion of them from the Garden of Eden. Paradise Lost elevated Miltons reputation as one of historys greatest poets. He also served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell. Milton achieved fame and recognition during his lifetime; his celebrated Areopagitica written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship is among historys most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His desire for freedom extended beyond his philosophy and was reflected in his style which included his introduction of new words to the English language. He was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations. Milton is described as the greatest English author by biographer William Hayley and he remains generally regarded as one of the preeminent writers in the English language though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death often on account of his republicanism. Samuel Johnson praised Paradise Lost as a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place and with respect to performance the second among the productions of the human mind though he described Miltons politics as those of an acrimonious and surly republican. Milton was revered by poets such as William Blake William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy. Phases of Miltons life parallel the major historical and political divisions in Stuart England at the time. In his early years Milton studied at Christs College at the University of Cambridge one of the worlds most prestigious universities and then travelled wrote poetry mostly for private circulation and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under Charles Is increasingly autocratic rule and Britains breakdown into constitutional confusion and ultimately civil war. While once considered dangerously radical and heretical Milton contributed to a seismic shift in accepted public opinions during his life that ultimately elevated him to public office in England. The Restoration of 1660 and his loss of vision later deprived Milton much of his public platform but he used the period to develop many of his major works. Miltons views developed from extensive reading travel and experience that began with his days as a student at Cambridge in the 1620s and continued through the English Civil War which started in 1642 and continued until 1651. By the time of his death in 1674 Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life but famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for political choices that placed him at odds with governing authorities. John Milton was born in Bread Street London on 9 December 1608 the son of composer John Milton and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard the Ranger Milton for embracing Protestantism. In London the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey and found lasting financial success as a scrivener. He lived in and worked from a house in Cheapside at Bread Street where the Mermaid Tavern was located. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a composer of music and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as Henry Lawes. The prosperity of Miltons father allowed his eldest son to obtain a private tutor Thomas Young a Scottish Presbyterian with an MA from the University of St Andrews. Youngs influence also served as the poets introduction to religious radicalism. After Youngs tutorship Milton attended St Pauls School in London where he began the study of Latin and Greek; the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English . Miltons first datable compositions are two psalms written at age 15 at Long Bennington. One contemporary source is Brief Lives of John Aubrey an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work Aubrey quotes Christopher Miltons younger brother When he was young he studied very hard and sat up very late commonly till twelve or one oclock at night. Aubrey adds His complexion exceeding fairehe was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christs College. In 1625 Milton gained entry to Christs College at the University of Cambridge where he graduated with a BA in 1629 ranking fourth of 24 honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge. Preparing at that time to become an Anglican priest he stayed on at Cambridge where he received his MA on 3 July 1632. Milton may have been rusticated in his first year at Cambridge for quarrelling with his tutor Bishop William Chappell. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote Elegia Prima his first Latin elegy to Charles Diodati a friend from St Pauls. Based on remarks of John Aubrey Chappell whipt Milton. This story is now disputed though certainly Milton disliked Chappell. Historian Christopher Hill notes that Milton was apparently rusticated and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal. It is also possible that like Isaac Newton four decades later Milton was sent home from Cambridge because of the plague which impacted Cambridge significantly in 1625. At Cambridge Milton was on good terms with Edward King; he later dedicated Lycidas to him. Milton also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian Roger Williams. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch. Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition Milton suffered from alienation among his peers during his time at Cambridge. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage he later observed they thought themselves gallant men and I thought them fools. Milton also was disdainful of the university curriculum which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour notably his sixth prolusion and his epitaphs on the death of Thomas Hobson. While at Cambridge he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems including On the Morning of Christs Nativity Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet W. Shakespeare LAllegro and Il Penseroso. It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities a lofty and steady confidence in himself perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time and a certain preservative from oblivion. After receiving his MA Milton moved to Hammersmith his fathers new home since the previous year. He also lived at Horton Berkshire from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a suburban village falling into the orbit of London and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague. He read both ancient and modern works of theology philosophy history politics literature and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Miltons intellectual development can be charted via entries in his commonplace book now in the British Library. As a result of such intensive study Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study Milton had command of Latin Greek Hebrew French Spanish and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his History of Britain and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after. Milton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his Arcades and Comus were both commissioned for masques composed for noble patrons connections of the Egerton family and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. Comus argues for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. He contributed his pastoral elegy Lycidas to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge. Drafts of these poems are preserved in Miltons poetry notebook known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at Trinity College Cambridge. In May 1638 accompanied by a manservant Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy for 15 months that lasted until July or August 1639. His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Miltons grand tour there appears to be just one primary source Miltons own Defensio Secunda. There are other records including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that according to Barbara Lewalski was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe. He first went to Calais and then on to Paris riding horseback with a letter from diplomat Henry Wotton to ambassador John Scudamore. Through Scudamore Milton met Hugo Grotius a Dutch law philosopher playwright and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from Nice to Genoa and then to Livorno and Pisa. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles and he met the astronomer Galileo who was under house arrest at Arcetri as well as others. Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the Accademia della Crusca along with smaller academies in the area including the Apatisti and the Svogliati. In which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance not just of its tongue but also of its wit I lingered for about two months. There I at once became the friend of many gentlemen eminent in rank and learning whose private academies I frequenteda Florentine institution which deserves great praise not only for promoting humane studies but also for encouraging friendly intercourse. He left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence Milton was able to have easy access to Romes intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October Milton attended a dinner given by the English College Rome despite his dislike for the Society of Jesus meeting English Catholics who were also gueststheologian Henry Holden and the poet Patrick Cary. He also attended musical events including oratorios operas and melodramas. Milton left for Naples toward the end of November where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control. During that time he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso patron to both Torquato Tasso and to Giambattista Marino. Originally Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to Sicily and then on to Greece but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in Defensio Secunda were sad tidings of civil war in England. Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent and spent time at Geneva with Diodatis uncle after he returned to Rome. In Defensio Secunda Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience Carnival and meet Lukas Holste a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March Milton travelled once again to Florence staying there for two months attending further meetings of the academies and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence he travelled through Lucca Bologna and Ferrara before coming to Venice. In Venice Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism later important in his political writings but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639. On returning to England where the Bishops Wars presaged further armed conflict Milton began to write prose tracts against episcopacy in the service of the Puritan and Parliamentary cause. Miltons first foray into polemics was Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England followed by Of Prelatical Episcopacy the two defences of Smectymnuus and The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader William Laud Archbishop of Canterbury with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period and deploying a wide knowledge of church history. He was supported by his fathers investments but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer Samuel Hartlib led him to write his short tract Of Education in 1644 urging a reform of the national universities. In June 1642 Milton paid a visit to the manor house at Forest Hill Oxfordshire and aged 34 married the 17-year-old Mary Powell. The marriage got off to a poor start as Mary did not adapt to Miltons austere lifestyle or get along with his nephews. Milton found her intellectually unsatisfying and disliked the royalist views she had absorbed from her family. It is also speculated that she refused to consummate the marriage. Mary soon returned home to her parents and did not come back until 1645 partly because of the outbreak of the Civil War. In the meantime her desertion prompted Milton to publish a series of pamphlets over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce beyond grounds of adultery. In 1643 Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings in parallel with Hezekiah Woodward who had more trouble. It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicencd Printing to the Parlament of England his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship. In Areopagitica Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty. Milton also courted another woman during this time; we know nothing of her except that her name was Davis and she turned him down. However it was enough to induce Mary Powell into returning to him which she did unexpectedly by begging him to take her back. They had two daughters in quick succession following their reconciliation. With the Parliamentary victory in the Civil War Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account and implicitly sanctioned the regicide; Miltons political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republics foreign correspondence in Latin and other languages but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor. In October 1649 he published Eikonoklastes an explicit defence of the regicide in response to the Eikon Basilike a phenomenal best-seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian martyr. A month later the exiled Charles II and his party published the defence of monarchy Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo written by leading humanist Claudius Salmasius. By January of the following year Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the Council of State. Milton worked more slowly than usual given the European audience and the English Republics desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte. On 24 February 1652 Milton published his Latin defence of the English people Defensio pro Populo Anglicano also known as the First Defence. Miltons pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the First Defence quickly made him a European reputation and the work ran to numerous editions. He addressed his Sonnet 16 to The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652 beginning Cromwell our chief of men... although it was not published until 1654. In 1654 Milton completed the second defence of the English nation Defensio secunda in response to an anonymous Royalist tract Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos a work that made many personal attacks on Milton. The second defence praised Oliver Cromwell now Lord Protector while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. Alexander Morus to whom Milton wrongly attributed the Clamor published an attack on Milton in response to which Milton published the autobiographical Defensio pro se in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660 although after he had become totally blind most of the work was done by his deputies Georg Rudolph Wecklein then Philip Meadows and from 1657 by the poet Andrew Marvell. By 1652 Milton had become totally blind; the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral retinal detachment or glaucoma are most likely. His blindness forced him to dictate his verse and prose to amanuenses who copied them out for him; one of these was Andrew Marvell. One of his best-known sonnets When I Consider How My Light is Spent titled by a later editor John Newton On His Blindness is presumed to date from this period. Cromwells death in 1658 caused the English Republic to collapse into feuding military and political factions. Milton however stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659 he published A Treatise of Civil Power attacking the concept of a state-dominated church as well as Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament soldiers and the people. Upon the Restoration in May 1660 Milton fearing for his life went into hiding while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after a general pardon was issued but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened such as Marvell now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663 marrying Elizabeth Minshull aged 24 a native of Wistaston Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London only retiring to a cottage during the Great Plague of LondonMiltons Cottage in Chalfont St. Giles his only extant home. During this period Milton published several minor prose works such as the grammar textbook Art of Logic and a History of Britain. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 Of True Religion arguing for toleration and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the Exclusion debate the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of EnglandJames Duke of Yorkbecause he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the Whig party and the Glorious Revolution. Milton died on 8 November 1674 and was buried in the church of St Giles-without-Cripplegate Fore Street London. However sources differ as to whether the cause of death was consumption or gout. According to an early biographer his funeral was attended by his learned and great Friends in London not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar. A monument was added in 1793 sculpted by John Bacon the Elder. Milton and his first wife Mary Powell had four children Mary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborahs birth. Miltons daughters survived to adulthood but he always had a strained relationship with them. On 12 November 1656 Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at St Margarets Westminster. She died on 3 February 1658 less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine who also died. Milton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull the niece of Thomas Mynshull a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester. The marriage took place at St Mary Aldermary in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap the marriage seemed happy according to John Aubrey and lasted more than 12 years until Miltons death. Samuel Johnson however claims that Mynshull was a domestic companion and attendant and Miltons nephew Edward Phillips relates that Mynshull oppressed his children in his lifetime and cheated them at his death. His nephews Edward and John Phillips were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary and Edward was Miltons first biographer. Miltons poetry was slow to see the light of day at least under his name. His first published poem was On Shakespeare anonymously included in the Second Folio edition of William Shakespeares plays in 1632. An annotated copy of the First Folio has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton. Milton collected his work in 1645 Poems in the midst of the excitement attending the possibility of establishing a new English government. The anonymous edition of Comus was published in 1637 and the publication of Lycidas in 1638 in Justa Edouardo King Naufrago was signed J. M. Otherwise. The 1645 collection was the only poetry of his to see print until Paradise Lost appeared in 1667. Miltons magnum opus the blank-verse epic poem Paradise Lost was composed by the blind and impoverished Milton from 1658 to 1664 with small but significant revisions published in 1674 . As a blind poet Milton dictated his verse to a series of aides in his employ. It has been argued that the poem reflects his personal despair at the failure of the Revolution yet affirms an ultimate optimism in human potential. Some literary critics have argued that Milton encoded many references to his unyielding support for the Good Old Cause. On 27 April 1667 Milton sold the publication rights for Paradise Lost to publisher Samuel Simmons for 5 with a further 5 to be paid if and when each print run sold out of between 1300 and 1500 copies. The first run was a quarto edition priced at three shillings per copy published in August 1667 and it sold out in eighteen months. Milton followed up the publication Paradise Lost with its sequel Paradise Regained which was published alongside the tragedy Samson Agonistes in 1671. Both of these works also reflect Miltons post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674 Milton supervised a second edition of Paradise Lost accompanied by an explanation of why the poem rhymes not and prefatory verses by Andrew Marvell. In 1673 Milton republished his 1645 Poems as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days. An unfinished religious manifesto De doctrina christiana probably written by Milton lays out many of his heterodox theological views and was not discovered and published until 1823. Miltons key beliefs were idiosyncratic not those of an identifiable group or faction and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone however stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience. He was his own man but he was anticipated by Henry Robinson in Areopagitica. While Miltons beliefs are generally considered to be consistent with Protestant Christianity Stephen Fallon argues that by the late 1650s Milton may have at least toyed with the idea of monism or animist materialism the notion that a single material substance which is animate self-active and free composes everything in the universe from stones and trees and bodies to minds souls angels and God. Fallon claims that Milton devised this position to avoid the mind-body dualism of Plato and Descartes as well as the mechanistic determinism of Hobbes. According to Fallon Miltons monism is most notably reflected in Paradise Lost when he has angels eat and the De Doctrina where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation ex Deo. Milton was a passionately individual Christian Humanist poet. He appears on the pages of seventeenth century English Puritanism an age characterized as the world turned upside down. He was a Puritan and yet was unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy. Thus Miltons political thought driven by competing convictions a Reformed faith and a Humanist spirit led to enigmatic outcomes..mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhidden;margin1em 0;padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5em;text-alignleft;padding-left1.6em;margin-top0 Miltons apparently contradictory stance on the vital problems of his age arose from religious contestations to the questions of the divine rights of kings. In both the cases he seems in control taking stock of the situation arising from the polarization of the English society on religious and political lines. He fought with the Puritans against the Cavaliers i.e. the Kings party and helped win the day. But the very same constitutional and republican polity when tried to curtail freedom of speech Milton given his humanistic zeal wrote Areopagitica . . .  Areopagitica was written in response to the Licensing Order in November 1644. Miltons political thought may be best categorized according to respective periods in his life and times. The years 164142 were dedicated to church politics and the struggle against episcopacy. After his divorce writings Areopagitica and a gap he wrote in 164954 in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 165960 he foresaw the Restoration and wrote to head it off. Miltons own beliefs were in some cases unpopular particularly his commitment to republicanism. In coming centuries Milton would be claimed as an early apostle of liberalism. According to James Tully A friend and ally in the pamphlet wars was Marchamont Nedham. Austin Woolrych considers that although they were quite close there is little real affinity beyond a broad republicanism between their approaches.Blair Worden remarks that both Milton and Nedham with others such as Andrew Marvell and James Harrington would have taken their problem with the Rump Parliament to be not the republic itself but the fact that it was not a proper republic. Woolrych speaks of the gulf between Miltons vision of the Commonwealths future and the reality. In the early version of his History of Britain begun in 1649 Milton was already writing off the members of the Long Parliament as incorrigible. He praised Oliver Cromwell as the Protectorate was set up; though subsequently he had major reservations. When Cromwell seemed to be backsliding as a revolutionary after a couple of years in power Milton moved closer to the position of Sir Henry Vane to whom he wrote a sonnet in 1652. The group of disaffected republicans included besides Vane John Bradshaw John Hutchinson Edmund Ludlow Henry Marten Robert Overton Edward Sexby and John Streater; but not Marvell who remained with Cromwells party. Milton had already commended Overton along with Edmund Whalley and Bulstrode Whitelocke in Defensio Secunda. Nigel Smith writes that As Richard Cromwell fell from power he envisaged a step towards a freer republic or free commonwealth writing in the hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an awkward position in the Ready and Easy Way because he wanted to invoke the Good Old Cause and gain the support of the republicans but without offering a democratic solution of any kind. His proposal backed by reference to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year. Milton an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned. John Milton was neither a clergyman nor a theologian; however theology and particularly English Calvinism formed the palette on which he created his greatest thoughts. Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great poet was undoubtedly Reformed . However Miltons Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many Renaissance artists before him Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In Comus Milton may make ironic use of the Caroline court masque by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems Miltons theological concerns become more explicit. His use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Miltons work notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Miltons quotations from scripture Fletcher comments For this work I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein. Miltons customary English Bible was the Authorized King James. When citing and writing in other languages he usually employed the Latin translation by Immanuel Tremellius though he was equipped to read the Bible in Latin in Greek and in Hebrew including the Targumim or Aramaic paraphrases of the Old Testament and the Syriac version of the New together with the available commentaries of those several versions. Milton embraced many heterodox Christian theological views. He has been accused of rejecting the Trinity believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism based on a non-trinitarian creed. Miltons alleged Arianism like much of his theology is still subject of debate and controversy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold argued that In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture. In Areopagitica Milton classified Arians and Socinians as errorists and schismatics alongside Arminians and Anabaptists. A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category. In 2019 John Rogers stated Heretics both John Milton and Isaac Newton were as most scholars now agree Arians. In his 1641 treatise Of Reformation Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy presenting Rome as a modern Babylon and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Miltons puritanical preference for Old Testament imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on Genesis those of John Calvin Paulus Fagius David Pareus and Andreus Rivetus. Through the Interregnum Milton often presents England rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy as an elect nation akin to the Old Testament Israel and shows its leader Oliver Cromwell as a latter-day Moses. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the Millennium which some sects such as the Fifth Monarchists predicted would arrive in England. Milton however would later criticise the worldly millenarian views of these and others and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the Four Empires. The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Miltons work. In Paradise Lost Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes Milton mourns the end of the godly Commonwealth. The Garden of Eden may allegorically reflect Miltons view of Englands recent Fall from Grace while Samsons blindness and captivitymirroring Miltons own lost sightmay be a metaphor for Englands blind acceptance of Charles II as king. Illustrated by Paradise Lost is mortalism the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies. Despite the Restoration of the monarchy Milton did not lose his personal faith; Samson shows how the loss of national salvation did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual while Paradise Regained expresses Miltons continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ. Though he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause the Dictionary of National Biography recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud and then moved similarly from the Dissenters by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England. Milton had come to stand apart from all sects though apparently finding the Quakers most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from nonconformist meetings Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place. Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age David Daiches wrote A fair theological summary may be that John Milton was a Puritan though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity made the great man at least a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement. Milton called in the Areopagitica for the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties to the conflicting Protestant denominations. According to American historian William Hunter Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a mans conscience government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel. Milton wrote The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce in 1643 at the beginning of the English Civil War. In August of that year he presented his thoughts to the Westminster Assembly of Divines which had been created by the Long Parliament to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I. Miltons thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Miltons views on divorce constituted a one-man heresy The fervently Presbyterian Edwards had included Miltons divorce tracts in his list in Gangraena of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as shallow Edwards in the satirical sonnet On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament usually dated to the latter half of 1646. Even here though his originality is qualified Thomas Gataker had already identified mutual solace as a principal goal in marriage. Milton abandoned his campaign to legitimise divorce after 1645 but he expressed support for polygamy in the the theological treatise that provides the clearest evidence for his views. Milton wrote during a period when thoughts about divorce were anything but simplistic; rather there was active debate among thinkers and intellectuals at the time. However Miltons basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643 at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce Milton argued that divorce was a private matter not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus the Christian community at least a majority within the Puritan sub-set approved of Miltons views. Nevertheless reaction among Puritans to Miltons views on divorce was mixed. Herbert Palmer a member of the Westminster Assembly condemned Milton in the strongest possible language If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured though deserving to be burnt whose Author hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this Palmer expressed his disapproval in a sermon addressed to the Westminster Assembly. The Scottish commissioner Robert Baillie described Palmers sermon as one of the most Scottish and free sermons that ever I heard any where. History was particularly important for the political class of the period and Lewalski considers that Milton more than most illustrates a remark of Thomas Hobbes on the weight placed at the time on the classical Latin historical writers Tacitus Livy Sallust and Cicero and their republican attitudes. Milton himself wrote that Worthy deeds are not often destitute of worthy relaters in Book II of his History of Britain. A sense of history mattered greatly to him The course of human history the immediate impact of the civil disorders and his own traumatic personal life are all regarded by Milton as typical of the predicament he describes as the misery that has bin since Adam. Once Paradise Lost was published Miltons stature as epic poet was immediately recognised. He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets including Shakespeare. Very early on though he was championed by Whigs and decried by Tories with the regicide Edmund Ludlow he was claimed as an early Whig while the High Tory Anglican minister Luke Milbourne lumped Milton in with other Agents of Darkness such as John Knox George Buchanan Richard Baxter Algernon Sidney and John Locke. The political ideas of Milton Locke Sidney and James Harrington strongly influenced the Radical Whigs whose ideology in turn was central to the American Revolution. Modern scholars of Miltons life politics and work are known as Miltonists his work is the subject of a very large amount of academic scholarship. In 2008 John Milton Passage a short passage by Bread Street into St Mary-le-Bow Churchyard in London was unveiled. John Dryden an early enthusiast in 1677 began the trend of describing Milton as the poet of the sublime. Drydens The State of Innocence and the Fall of Man an Opera is evidence of an immediate cultural influence. In 1695 Patrick Hume became the first editor of Paradise Lost providing an extensive apparatus of annotation and commentary particularly chasing down allusions. In 1732 the classical scholar Richard Bentley offered a corrected version of Paradise Lost. Bentley was considered presumptuous and was attacked in the following year by Zachary Pearce. Christopher Ricks judges that as critic Bentley was both acute and wrong-headed and incorrigibly eccentric; William Empson also finds Pearce to be more sympathetic to Bentleys underlying line of thought than is warranted. There was an early partial translation of Paradise Lost into German by Theodore Haak and based on that a standard verse translation by Ernest Gottlieb von Berge. A subsequent prose translation by Johann Jakob Bodmer was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist Henry Fuseli. Many Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Miltons poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden among them were Alexander Pope Joseph Addison Thomas Newton and Samuel Johnson. For example in The Spectator Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes annotations and interpretations of certain passages of Paradise Lost. Jonathan Richardson senior and Jonathan Richardson the younger co-wrote a book of criticism. In 1749 Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Miltons poetical works with annotations provided by himself Dryden Pope Addison the Richardsons and others. Newtons edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentleys infamous edition described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on Paradise Lost and Milton was included in his Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets . In The Age of Louis XIV Voltaire said Milton remains the glory and the wonder of England. William Blake considered Milton the major English poet. Blake placed Edmund Spenser as Miltons precursor and saw himself as Miltons poetical son. In his Milton A Poem in Two Books Blake uses Milton as a character. Edmund Burke was a theorist of the sublime and he regarded Miltons description of Hell as exemplary of sublimity as an aesthetic concept. For Burke it was to set alongside mountain-tops a storm at sea and infinity. In The Beautiful and the Sublime he wrote No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening or of setting terrible things if I may use the expression in their strongest light by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton. The Romantic poets valued his exploration of blank verse but for the most part rejected his religiosity. William Wordsworth began his sonnet London 1802 with Milton thou shouldst be living at this hour and modelled The Prelude his own blank verse epic on Paradise Lost. John Keats found the yoke of Miltons style uncongenial; he exclaimed that Miltonic verse cannot be written but in an artful or rather artists humour. Keats felt that Paradise Lost was a beautiful and grand curiosity but his own unfinished attempt at epic poetry Hyperion was unsatisfactory to the author because amongst other things it had too many Miltonic inversions. In The Madwoman in the Attic Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar note that Mary Shelleys novel Frankenstein is in the view of many critics one of the key Romantic readings of Paradise Lost. The Victorian age witnessed a continuation of Miltons influence. Thomas Carlyle declared him the moral king of English literature while George Eliot and Thomas Hardy were particularly inspired by Miltons poetry and biography. Hostile 20th-century criticism by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound did not reduce Miltons stature.F. R. Leavis in The Common Pursuit responded to the points made by Eliot in particular the claim that the study of Milton could be of no help it was only a hindrance by arguing As if it were a matter of deciding not to study Milton The problem rather was to escape from an influence that was so difficult to escape from because it was unrecognized belonging as it did to the climate of the habitual and natural.Harold Bloom in The Anxiety of Influence wrote that Milton is the central problem in any theory and history of poetic influence in English . Miltons Areopagitica is still cited as relevant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A quotation from AreopagiticaA good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond lifeis displayed in many public libraries including the New York Public Library. The title of Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials trilogy is derived from a quotation His dark materials to create more worlds line 915 of Book II in Paradise Lost. Pullman was concerned to produce a version of Miltons poem accessible to teenagers and has spoken of Milton as our greatest public poet. Titles of a number of other well-known literary works are also derived from Miltons writings. Examples include Thomas Wolfes Look Homeward Angel Aldous Huxleys Eyeless in Gaza Arthur Koestlers Darkness at Noon and William Goldings Darkness Visible. T. S. Eliot believed that of no other poet is it so difficult to consider the poetry simply as poetry without our theological and political dispositions... making unlawful entry. Miltons use of blank verse in addition to his stylistic innovations influenced later poets. At the time poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama and Paradise Lost was taken as a unique exemplar. Said Isaac Watts in 1734 Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us. Miltonic verse might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the heroic couplet. Lack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Miltons defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of Paradise Lost to be an extension of his own personal liberty This neglect then of Rhime... is to be esteemd an example set the first in English of ancient liberty recoverd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing. This pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet. Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish he granted primacy to freedom breadth and imaginative suggestiveness eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Miltons poetic worldview included grudgingly acknowledgement of the poets resemblance to classical writers . Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like Collins Ode to Evening were not uncommon after 1740. A second aspect of Miltons blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm His blank-verse paragraph and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre. Before Milton the sense of regular rhythm... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature. The Heroick measure according to Samuel Johnson is pure... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable.Caesural pauses most agreed were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic with no enjambed endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications which included hypermetrical syllables inversion or slighting of stresses and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line. Milton deemed these features to be reflective of the transcendental union of order and freedom. Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes The English... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit. Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other as did Oliver Goldsmith Henry Pemberton and Scott of Amwell whose general opinion it was that Miltons frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was displeasing to a nice ear. It was not until the late 18th century that poets began to appreciate the composition of Miltons harmony... how he loved to vary his pauses his measures and his feet which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification. By the 20th century American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton was able by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry. Miltons pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well. It included many Latinate neologisms as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood. In 1740 Francis Peck identified some examples of Miltons old words . The Miltonian dialect as it was called was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of Paradise Lost in his Homer translation while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton. The language of Thomsons finest poems was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect with the same tone and sensibilities as Paradise Lost. Following to Milton English poetry from Pope to John Keats exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative the imaginative and poetic value of words. Miltons ode At a solemn Musick was set for choir and orchestra as Blest Pair of Sirens by Hubert Parry and Miltons poem On the Morning of Christs Nativity was set as a large-scale choral work by Cyril Rootham . Milton also wrote the hymn Let us with a gladsome mind a versification of Psalm 136. His LAllegro and Il Penseroso with additional material were magnificently set by Handel .
Margaret Cavendish,Her husband William Cavendish 1st Duke of Newcastle was a Royalist commander in Northern England during the First English Civil War and in 1644 went into self-imposed exile in France. Margaret accompanied him and remained abroad until the Stuart Restoration in 1660. She wrote using her own name in a period when most women writers remained anonymous. Born Margaret Lucas to Sir Thomas Lucas and Elizabeth Leighton she was the youngest child of the family. She had four sisters and three brothers the royalists Sir John Lucas Sir Thomas Lucas and Sir Charles Lucas who owned the manor of St Johns Abbey Colchester. She became an attendant on Queen Henrietta Maria and travelled with her into exile in France living for a time at the court of the young King Louis XIV. She became the second wife of William Cavendish 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1645 when he was a marquess. Cavendish as a poet philosopher writer of prose romances essayist and playwright published under her own name at a time when most women writers remained anonymous. Her topics included gender power manners scientific method and philosophy. Her utopian romance The Blazing World is one of the earliest examples of science fiction. She was unusual in her time for publishing extensively in natural philosophy and early modern science producing over a dozen original works; with her revised works the total came to 21. Cavendish has been championed and criticised as a unique ground-breaking woman writer. She rejected the Aristotelianism and mechanical philosophy of the 17th century preferring a vitalist model. In May 1667 she became the first woman to attend a meeting at the Royal Society of London criticising and engaging with members and philosophers such as Robert Boyle. She has been claimed as an early opponent of animal testing. Cavendishs publications brought her fame and helped to disprove the contemporary belief that women were inherently inferior to men. Cavendish used them to advocate womens education women were capable of learning and benefiting from education and she insisted her own works would have been better still if like her brothers she had been able to attend school. Cavendishs father Thomas Lucas was exiled after a duel that led to the death of one Mr. Brooks but pardoned by King James. He returned to England in 1603. As the youngest of eight Cavendish recorded spending a lot of time with her siblings. She had no formal education but had access to libraries and tutors although she hinted that the children paid little heed to tutors who were rather for formality than benefit. Cavendish began putting ideas down on paper at an early age although it was poorly accepted for women to display such intelligence at the time and she kept her efforts in the privacy of her home. The family had significant means and Cavendish stated that her widowed mother chose to keep her family in a condition not much lower than when her father was alive; the children had access to honest pleasures and harmless delights. Her mother had little to no male help. When Queen Henrietta Maria was in Oxford Cavendish never gained permission from her mother to become a lady-in-waiting. She accompanied the Queen into exile in France away from her family for the first time. She notes that while she was confident in the company of her siblings amongst strangers she became bashful being afraid she might speak or act inappropriately without her siblings guidance while anxious to be well received and well liked. She spoke only when necessary and so came to be regarded as a fool which Cavendish stated that she preferred to being seen as wanton or rude. Regretting that she had left home to be a lady-in-waiting Cavendish informed her mother that she wanted to leave the court but her mother persuaded her not to disgrace herself by leaving and provided her with funds that Cavendish noted quite exceeded the normal means of a courtier. She remained a lady-in-waiting for two more years before marrying William Cavendish then still Marquess of Newcastle. Cavendish noted that her husband liked her bashfulness; he was the only man she was ever in love with not for his title wealth or power but for merit justice gratitude duty and fidelity. She saw these as attributes that held people together even in misfortune and in their case helped them to endure suffering for their political allegiance. Cavendish had no children despite efforts by her physician to help her conceive. Her husband had five surviving children from a previous marriage two of whom Jane and Elizabeth wrote a comic play The Concealed Fancies. Cavendish later wrote a biography of her husband The Life of the Thrice Noble High and Puissant Prince William Cavendish. In her dedication Cavendish recalls a time when rumours surrounded the authorship of her works that her husband wrote them. Cavendish notes that her husband defended her from these but admits to a creative relationship even as her writing tutor for writing fashions an image of a husband and wife who rely on each other in the public realm of print. A few years after her marriage she and her husbands brother Sir Charles Cavendish returned to England. Cavendish had heard that her husbands estate sequestrated due to his being a royalist delinquent would be sold and that she as his wife could hope to benefit from the sale. In the event she received no benefit. She noted that while many women petitioned for funds she herself only did so once and being denied decided such efforts were not worth the trouble. After a year and a half she left England to be with her husband again. Cavendish stated in A True Relation of My Birth Breeding and Life that her bashful nature which she described as melancholia made her repent my going from home to see the World abroad. It manifested itself in reluctance to discuss her work in public but this she satirised in her writing. Cavendish defined and sought self-cures for the physical manifestations of her melancholia which included chill paleness inability to speak and erratic gestures. Cavendishs views on God and religion remained ambiguous. Her writings show her as a Christian but she did not often address the matter. In her Physical Opinions she explicitly stated her belief in the existence of God Pray account me not an Atheist but believe as I do in God Almighty but sought to split philosophy from theology and so avoid debating Gods actions in many of her philosophical works. Her theological temerity was unusual at a time when much womens writing was built around religion. Although Cavendish acknowledged Gods existence she held that natural reason cannot perceive or have an idea of an immaterial being. So when we name God we name an Inexpressible and Incomprehensible Being. Cavendish in her memoir explained her enjoyment in reinventing herself through fashion. She said she aimed at uniqueness in dress thoughts and behaviour and disliked wearing the same fashions as other women. She also made her desire for fame public. Several passages remark on her virtuous character while acknowledging goodness in others she thought it acceptable to hope to better them and even achieve everlasting fame. She expected to be criticised for deciding to write a memoir but retorted that it was written for herself not for delight to give later generations a true account of her lineage and life. She noted that others such as Caesar and Ovid had done the same. She died in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 7 January 1674. Her husband arranged for a monument by the sculptor Grinling Gibbons to be erected in the north transept of the abbey. The epitaph reads Her name was Margaret Lucas youngest daughter of Lord Lucas earl of Colchester a noble family for all the brothers were valiant and all the sisters virtuous.All the Brothers Were Valiant became the title of a novel and number of film adaptations in the early 20th century. Poems and Fancies encompasses poems epistles and some prose on topics that include natural philosophy atoms nature personified macromicrocosms other worlds death battle hunting love honour and fame. Her poems at times take a dialogue form between such pairs as earth and darkness an oak and a tree-cutter melancholy and mirth and peace and war. As noted by Mistress Toppe formerly Elizabeth Chaplain and Cavendishs maid Cavendishs writings took the form of poetical fiction moral instruction philosophical opinion dialogue discourses and poetical romances. Poems and Fancies included The Animal Parliament a prose piece consisting largely of speeches and letters. The collection concludes with her thoughts on her writing and an advertisement for one of her future publications. Cavendish concluded the collection by stating she was aware that she did not write elegantly and that her phrasing and placement of words could be criticised. She said she had difficulty creating rhymes that could communicate her intended meaning. In short Cavendish stated that she strove for meaning at the expense of elegance her aim being to communicate ideas. She also noted that she expected her work to be criticised for not being useful but she wrote not to instruct her readers in the arts sciences or divinity but to pass her time asserting that she made better use of her time than many others. Cavendish returned to these points in her epistles and poems. Cavendish like authors such as Aphra Behn and William Wordsworth stated her intended audience writing purpose and philosophy in prefaces prologues epilogues and epistles. Her several epistle dedications for Poems and Fancies often sought to justify writing at a time when women writers were not encouraged and in terms of her subject choice. She instructed readers in how to read and respond to her poetry most often by inviting praise from supporters and requesting silence from those unaffected by her work. Cavendish commonly used the epistles to admit and excuse potential weaknesses in her writing. They were directed at specific audiences and varied accordingly. Looking at several of the epistles in Poems and Fancies her dedication to Sir Charles Cavendish her brother in law compares writing poetry to spinning and calls poetry mental spinning it was commonly thought to be more appropriate for women to spin than to write but she herself was better at writing. This is one of several occasions when Cavendish calls attention to stereotypical gender roles and expands on her reasons for not following them. As here Cavendish often employed metaphors to describe her writing in terms of stereotypical feminine tasks or interests such as spinning fashion and motherhood. While criticising her own work she said it would seem better if Sir Charles Cavendish looked favourably on it. Cavendish often appealed to readers for applause if it were well received it would be somewhat improved. She ends by complimenting Charless charity and generosity. In her epistle to noble and worthy ladies and in many others Cavendish plainly expresses her desire for fame. She was not concerned that the best people should like her writing as long as many people did. She justified this by linking fame to noise and noise to great numbers of people. Cavendish often assumed a defensive position here justified by asserting that she expected critiques from males and females not only of her writing but of her practice of writing itself. Cavendish argued that women who busy themselves writing will not act ineptly or gossip. Though she expected criticism from females she calls for female support in gaining honour and reputation. She ends by stating that if she fails she will see herself as martyred for the cause of women. In her epistle to Mistress Toppe Cavendish states a desire for fame as her main reason for writing. Again she asks for acceptance of her writing as a digression from accepted gender norms. While she often brings in metaphors of domestic or stereotypical feminine activities here she tries to excuse her desire for fame by distancing her ambition from what is feminine her ambition is a quest for glory perfection and praise which she states is not effeminate. Even while writing and pursuing fame she remained modest and honourable and does nothing to dishonour her family. Cavendish attributed her confidence as a type of censor to her belief that there is no evil only innocence in her desire for fame. As to her writing without permission Cavendish excuses herself by stating it is easier to get a pardon after the fact than to obtain leave beforehand. She places writing over gossip as a common and negative female activity. She credits her books as tangible examples of her contemplation and contrasts her self-proclaimed harmless ideas with wild ideas that might lead to indiscreet actions. Cavendish explored writing closet dramas in her exile. She became one of the best-known women playwrights through her interest in philosophical nature.This epistle is followed by a response from Mistress Toppe praising Cavendish and her skill in poetical fiction moral instruction philosophical opinion dialogue discourses and poetical romances. Cavendish included a prefatory letter to natural philosophers. She knew no language but English and even her English was somewhat limited since she was familiar only with that which is most usually spoke. In other words she downplayed her knowledge of the technical vocabulary used by natural philosophers and thereby her knowledge of opinions and discourses that preceded her own. She then dismissed errors she might make as trivial asserting that she did not mean her text to be taken as truth. She wrote simply to pass time and expected her work to be read for the same end. This epistle also explained her writing in verse poets were thought to write fiction and that fiction was aligned with pastime not truth. So verse might be expected to contain errors. Cavendish lamented that her work was not more entertaining and advised readers to skip any part they did not like. Her epistle states that with no children and at that time no estate she has a lot of spare time which she fills by writing not housekeeping. Food husbandry in poetry was well-ordered fancy composed of fine language proper phrases and significant words. Cavendish excused errors that might be found in her work as due to youth and inexperience for she wrote only to distract herself from hardships of her husbands and her own. Comparing her book to a child she said that it was innocent young well-behaved bashful and sensitive. Readers should blame her not the book if they did not like it. If however the book was well liked she made it clear that she expected fame. In her epistle to the poets Cavendish notes that as women seldom wrote her writing may be ridiculed as the strange and unusual seem fantastical the fantastical seems odd and the odd seems ridiculous. She requests that her work be judged by reason not prejudice. She then excuses weaknesses in her poetry by stating that she writes only to escape melancholy thoughts and fill idle time. She employs a foodfeasting metaphor her poems are not ripe but applause and praise will make them pass as a general feast to those of vulgar taste who take quantity over quality. As was typical in her writing applause is welcomed and criticism censored as she advises those who dislike her poetry to keep silent. Hers are poems of fancy and so require study. She recommends that as one with a troubled conscience ought to look to a minister for guidance. Likewise a reader will ask a poet for help in understanding her poems. Attempting again to guide readers to a positive reception of her book Cavendish distinguishes poets from rhymers and advises people not to call her book nonsense or poorly constructed out of their own ignorance and malice. Returning again to her desire for fame Cavendish notes that if judged by an honest poet who would not be envious her work would receive applause. Cavendish asks the reader to read her fancies slowly paying heed to each word for each is a fancy itself. She warns that if readers lose their place or skip lines they will miss the meaning of the entire work. Cavendish followed some epistles with poems on how they came to be published and how they should be received. The proximity of the poems to the epistles and their similarity in subject and tone suggests that they may be interpreted as Cavendishs own point of view. The poem The Poetresses sic hasty Resolution like many of Cavendishs epistles contains excuses for errors that may be found in the poets work and begs for praise. The poet states that self-love influences her judgement of her own poetry which she finds she likes so much that she is moved to continue writing in hope of fame. She claims to write without thought of how her work would be received by critics. She then recalls how she was visited by Reason who advised her to stop writing. Reason said her writing was a waste of time that her work would not be well received and she should not have her work printed so that the printer would not lose money. Reason also stated that there were already too many books and she should burn what she had written to spare the world from more. The poet noted her own angry response she sent her book to press before she could be persuaded otherwise. In hindsight however she regretted doing so she felt ashamed by her writing and told the reader to pity her and wipe away her tears with praise. In The Poetresses Petition she compares a negative reception to her books with their death. If the books suffer such a death she requests silence and that they be forgotten without alteration or inscriptions and left undisturbed unless new merit is found. Again Cavendish sought to censor criticism and promote fame by instructing that only positive criticism should be voiced. In An Apology for Writing So Much upon This Book she compares it to a child and the bookchild and authorparent to birds. The book is like a baby bird just going out on its own. The author like a parent bird is unsure whether the bookbaby bird will be safe and chirrups an attempt to protect it. This is viewed as Cavendishs most ambitious attempt to combine modes and genres. It includes short prose romances The Contract and Assaulted and Pursued Chastity and several prefatory addresses to the reader. The stories concern the advantageous production of woman as spectacle and repeatedly the aristocratic and chivalric trope of the fair unknown. Cavendish published this autobiographical memoir as an addendum to Natures Pictures Drawn by Fancies Pencil to the Life in 1656. She wrote it at the age of 33 which has been discussed by literary critics. One critic sees Cavendishs autobiography as a way to gain credibility and a marketable image that would undercut a socially improper public image. Cavendish wrote her autobiography in response to what people were saying of her in her lifetime. It relates Cavendishs lineage social status fortune upbringing education and marriage describes her pastimes and manners and offers an account of her personality and ambition including thoughts on her bashfulness contemplative nature and writing. She also shares her views on gender politics and class . The memoir details the lives of her family including a short account of her brother Charles Lucas one of the best Civil War Cavalier cavalry commanders executed by the Parliamentarians for treason in the Second English Civil War. She goes on to address the economic and personal hardships that she and her family faced from the war and their political allegiance such as loss of estates and bereavements. Published in 1664 by William Wilson CCXI Sociable Letters is a collection of letters written as if composed by real women. The organisation is similar to that of The Worlds Olio . The topics are as varied as the forms and length of the letters. They cover marriage war politics medicine science English and classical literature and miscellaneous matters like gambling and religious extremism. Some letters seem to point to characters as actual people Thomas Hobbes may appear in letter 173 and C. R. stand for King Charles II and some are addressed to real people with whom Cavendish often communicated but most are fictional leading to a surprisingly vibrant ongoing conversation and observation of contemporary life. Eileen ONeill provides an overview of Cavendishs natural philosophy and its critical reception in her introduction to Observations upon Experimental Philosophy. She describes Cavendishs natural philosophy as rejecting Aristotelianism and mechanical philosophy and favouring Stoic doctrines while women rarely wrote about natural philosophy in the 17th century Cavendish published six books on the subject. ONeill points out that Cavendish herself was not formally educated in natural philosophy though William Cavendish and his brother Charles shared an interest in the subject and supported her interest and study in the area. She may also have been influenced by social encounters with philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes. ONeill believes Hobbes had marked influence on Cavendishs natural philosophy making her one of the few 17th-century supporters of Hobbes materialist philosophy which argued that incorporeal souls did not exist in nature. Beginning in the 1660s Cavendish began to study the work of her contemporaries more seriously. ONeill suggests that such study was meant to enable Cavendish to argue her own points better by contrast with those of other natural philosophers. ONeill notes that Cavendishs natural philosophy and her writing in general were criticised by many contemporaries and by more recent readers such as Pepys Henry More and Virginia Woolf. Cavendishs work has also received positive criticism and been lauded by many for tackling typically male-dominated subjects such as natural philosophy. Letters and poems of praise by her husband were included in several of her published works. Cavendish in her preface to Observations upon Experimental Philosophy states that she expects readers to say that her practice of writing prolifically is a disease. If so Cavendish stated many others including Aristotle Cicero Homer and St Augustine have suffered the same disease. It was an honour for someone of great ambition to share the disease of such wise and eloquent men. In these as in her other writings she asserts that she writes for herself and that her writing is a harmless pastime when compared with those of many other women. She contradicts herself however by adding that she writes for delight which she had denied in her previous work. Also somewhat contradictory is her intention of continuing to write even if she has no readers which belies her desire for fame. Ultimately Cavendish excuses her criticism of and engagement with the theories of other natural philosophers as a necessary step in the search for truth. In her epistle to the reader Cavendish writes that womans wit may equal that of man and women may be able to learn as easily as men. She argues that wit is natural whereas learning is artificial and in her time men have more chance of educating themselves than women. Cavendish remarks on her own experience reading philosophical works many such works have challenged her understanding with their frequently difficult words and expressions. Thus Cavendish advises writers of philosophy to use language appropriate to less expert readers. She defends this by stating that philosophical terms should ease communication of thoughts. She believes that successful communication is possible in all languages and accuses those who complicate communication of aiming for esteem from those who admire writing simply because they do not understand it without considering that it may be nonsense. In her own work Cavendish states she chooses not to use difficult terms although she adds that she understands such terms. Her stated reason is that she desires her work to be accessible to people regardless of their education. Her aim is to communicate her ideas clearly. She requests that any errors that may be found in her work be overlooked and readers remain focused on her main ideas. Here as in many epistles she instructs readers on how to approach her work and requests them to read it fully and withhold criticism until they have done so. Cavendishs prose tale was published in 1666 and again in 1668 each time with Observations upon Experimental Philosophy. As many such as Silvia Bowerbank and Sara Mendelson have noted this early version of science fiction critiques and explores such issues as science gender and power. It also views relations between imagination and reason and philosophy and fiction. Cavendish writes herself into the book which details a fictional quite separate new world and its empress. She remarks in her epilogue that she is the empress adding that in much the same way as there was a Charles the First she would be seen as Margaret the First. Two volumes of Cavendishs dramatic works were printed. Plays printed by A. Warren includes Plays Never Before Printed was published by Anne Maxwell  Cavendish also published collections of Philosophical Letters orations as in her collection entitled Orations . Many of her works address such issues as natural philosophy gender power and manners. Cavendishs plays were never acted in her lifetime but a number including The Convent of Pleasure have been staged since. Several of Cavendishs works have epistles prefaces prologues and epilogues in which she discusses her work philosophy and ambition while instructing the reader on how to read and respond to her writing. Her work has been alternately criticised and championed from its original publication to the present day. Cavendish was an unorthodox and daring intellectual who received positive and negative commentary from her contemporaries. Negative comments can be found by the Royal Society member Samuel Pepys who once wrote of her as a mad conceited ridiculous woman though he was eager to read her work.Dorothy Osborne reflected in one published letter after reading a book by the Duchess that she was sure there are soberer people in Bedlam. She also had numerous admirers Constantijn Huygens Mildmay Fane Earl of Westmorland John Dryden Kenelm Digby Henry More were among them. Joseph Glanvill and Walter Charleton corresponded with her and engaged with philosophy and science. After her death her husband William Cavendish compiled a book of admiring letters poems and epitaphs by numerous people. In the nineteenth century Charles Lamb enjoyed her Sociable Letters and so much admired her biography of her husband that he called it a jewel for which no casket is rich enough. James Fitzmaurice argues Cavendish was viewed sympathetically by the English Romantic poets. Margaret Cavendish was the first person to develop an original theory of atomism in Britain. She was also the first female to be invited to attend a session of the Royal Society. One member John Evelyn saw in Cavendish a mighty pretender to learning poetry and philosophy. Yet her knowledge was recognised by some such as the protofeminist Bathsua Makin The present Dutchess of New-Castle by her own Genius rather than any timely Instruction over-tops many grave Gown-Men. She saw her exemplifying what women could become through education. New manuscript evidence also suggests she was read and taken seriously by at least some early Royal Society members such as its secretary Nehemiah Grew. This new interest has engendered media projects. The film The Blazing World is loosely inspired by Cavendishs science fiction story. Siri Hustvedts The Blazing World which was also loosely inspired by Cavendish won The Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction and was long listed for the Booker Prize. Margaret the First by Danielle Dutton dramatises her with lucid precision and sharp cuts through narrative time as a new approach to imagining the life of a historical woman. As the digital humanities grow several projects have begun archiving Cavendish. The International Margaret Cavendish Society was set up as a means of communication between scholars worldwide to increase awareness of Cavendishs scholarly presence as a hub for newsletters contacts and links to Cavendishs works. Likewise the Digital Cavendish Project works to make Cavendishs writing accessible and readable for people across the web and highlight digital research image archives scholarly projects and teaching materials. On 26 January 2018 the Digital Cavendish Twitter account announced that its next goal was to compile the Complete Works of Margaret Cavendish.
John Dryden,John Dryden was an English poet literary critic translator and playwright who in 1668 was appointed Englands first Poet Laureate. He is seen as dominating the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden. Romanticist writer Sir Walter Scott called him Glorious John. Dryden was born in the village rectory of Aldwincle near Thrapston in Northamptonshire where his maternal grandfather was the rector of All Saints. He was the eldest of fourteen children born to Erasmus Dryden and wife Mary Pickering paternal grandson of Sir Erasmus Dryden 1st Baronet and wife Frances Wilkes Puritan landowning gentry who supported the Puritan cause and Parliament. He was a second cousin once removed of Jonathan Swift. As a boy Dryden lived in the nearby village of Titchmarsh where it is likely that he received his first education. In 1644 he was sent to Westminster School as a Kings Scholar where his headmaster was Dr. Richard Busby a charismatic teacher and severe disciplinarian. Having been re-founded by Elizabeth I Westminster during this period embraced a very different religious and political spirit encouraging royalism and high Anglicanism. Whatever Drydens response to this was he clearly respected the headmaster and would later send two of his sons to school at Westminster. As a humanist public school Westminster maintained a curriculum which trained pupils in the art of rhetoric and the presentation of arguments for both sides of a given issue. This is a skill which would remain with Dryden and influence his later writing and thinking as much of it displays these dialectical patterns. The Westminster curriculum included weekly translation assignments which developed Drydens capacity for assimilation. This was also to be exhibited in his later works. His years at Westminster were not uneventful and his first published poem an elegy with a strong royalist feel on the death of his schoolmate Henry Lord Hastings from smallpox alludes to the execution of King Charles I which took place on 30 January 1649 very near the school where Dr. Busby had first prayed for the King and then locked in his schoolboys to prevent their attending the spectacle. In 1650 Dryden went up to Trinity College Cambridge. Here he would have experienced a return to the religious and political ethos of his childhood the Master of Trinity was a Puritan preacher by the name of Thomas Hill who had been a rector in Drydens home village. Though there is little specific information on Drydens undergraduate years he would most certainly have followed the standard curriculum of classics rhetoric and mathematics. In 1654 he obtained his BA graduating top of the list for Trinity that year. In June of the same year Drydens father died leaving him some land which generated a little income but not enough to live on. Returning to London during the Protectorate Dryden obtained work with Oliver Cromwells Secretary of State John Thurloe. This appointment may have been the result of influence exercised on his behalf by his cousin the Lord Chamberlain Sir Gilbert Pickering. At Cromwells funeral on 23 November 1658 Dryden processed with the Puritan poets John Milton and Andrew Marvell. Shortly thereafter he published his first important poem Heroic Stanzas a eulogy on Cromwells death which is cautious and prudent in its emotional display. In 1660 Dryden celebrated the Restoration of the monarchy and the return of Charles II with Astraea Redux an authentic royalist panegyric. In this work the Interregnum is illustrated as a time of chaos and Charles is seen as the restorer of peace and order. After the Restoration as Dryden quickly established himself as the leading poet and literary critic of his day he transferred his allegiances to the new government. Along with Astraea Redux Dryden welcomed the new regime with two more panegyrics To His Sacred Majesty A Panegyric on his Coronation and To My Lord Chancellor . These poems suggest that Dryden was looking to court a possible patron but he was to instead make a living in writing for publishers not for the aristocracy and thus ultimately for the reading public. These and his other nondramatic poems are occasionalthat is they celebrate public events. Thus they are written for the nation rather than the self and the Poet Laureate is obliged to write a certain number of these per annum. In November 1662 Dryden was proposed for membership in the Royal Society and he was elected an early fellow. However Dryden was inactive in Society affairs and in 1666 was expelled for non-payment of his dues. On 1 December 1663 Dryden married the royalist sister of Sir Robert HowardLady Elizabeth. Drydens works occasionally contain outbursts against the married state but also celebrations of the same. Thus little is known of the intimate side of his marriage. Lady Elizabeth bore three sons one of whom became a Roman Catholic priest. With the reopening of the theatres in 1660 after the Puritan ban Dryden began writing plays. His first play The Wild Gallant appeared in 1663 and was not successful but was still promising and from 1668 on he was contracted to produce three plays a year for the Kings Company in which he became a shareholder. During the 1660s and 1670s theatrical writing was his main source of income. He led the way in Restoration comedy his best-known work being Marriage à la Mode as well as heroic tragedy and regular tragedy in which his greatest success was All for Love .  Dryden was never satisfied with his theatrical writings and frequently suggested that his talents were wasted on unworthy audiences. He thus was making a bid for poetic fame off-stage. In 1667 around the same time his dramatic career began he published Annus Mirabilis a lengthy historical poem which described the English defeat of the Dutch naval fleet and the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was a modern epic in pentameter quatrains that established him as the preeminent poet of his generation and was crucial in his attaining the posts of Poet Laureate and historiographer royal . When the Great Plague of London closed the theatres in 1665 Dryden retreated to Wiltshire where he wrote Of Dramatick Poesie arguably the best of his unsystematic prefaces and essays. Dryden constantly defended his own literary practice and Of Dramatick Poesie the longest of his critical works takes the form of a dialogue in which four characters each based on a prominent contemporary with Dryden himself as Neander debate the merits of classical French and English drama. The greater part of his critical works introduce problems which he is eager to discuss and show the work of a writer of independent mind who feels strongly about his own ideas ideas which demonstrate the breadth of his reading. He felt strongly about the relation of the poet to tradition and the creative process and his best heroic play Aureng-zebe has a prologue which denounces the use of rhyme in serious drama. His play All for Love was written in blank verse and was to immediately follow Aureng-Zebe. Drydens poem An Essay upon Satire contained a number of attacks on King Charles II his mistresses and courtiers but most pointedly on the Earl of Rochester a notorious womaniser. Rochester responded by hiring thugs who attacked Dryden whilst walking back from Wills Coffee House to his house on Gerrard Street. At around 8 pm on 18 December 1679 Dryden was attacked in Rose Alley behind the Lamb Flag pub near his home in Covent Garden. Dryden survived the attack offering 50 for the identity of the thugs placed in the London Gazette and a Royal Pardon if one of them would confess. No one claimed the reward. Drydens greatest achievements were in satiric verse the mock-heroic Mac Flecknoe a more personal product of his laureate years was a lampoon circulated in manuscript and an attack on the playwright Thomas Shadwell. Drydens main goal in the work is to satirize Shadwell ostensibly for his offenses against literature but more immediately we may suppose for his habitual badgering of him on the stage and in print. It is not a belittling form of satire but rather one which makes his object great in ways which are unexpected transferring the ridiculous into poetry. This line of satire continued with Absalom and Achitophel and The Medal . His other major works from this period are the religious poems Religio Laici written from the position of a member of the Church of England; his 1683 edition of Plutarchs Lives Translated From the Greek by Several Hands in which he introduced the word biography to English readers; and The Hind and the Panther which celebrates his conversion to Roman Catholicism. He wrote Britannia Rediviva celebrating the birth of a son and heir to the Catholic King and Queen on 10 June 1688. When later in the same year James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution Drydens refusal to take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs William and Mary left him out of favour at court. Thomas Shadwell succeeded him as Poet Laureate and he was forced to give up his public offices and live by the proceeds of his pen. Dryden translated works by Horace Juvenal Ovid Lucretius and Theocritus a task which he found far more satisfying than writing for the stage. In 1694 he began work on what would be his most ambitious and defining work as translator The Works of Virgil which was published by subscription. The publication of the translation of Virgil was a national event and brought Dryden the sum of 1400. Dryden translated the Aeneid into couplets turning Virgils almost 10000 lines into 13700 lines; Joseph Addison wrote the prefaces for each book and William Congreve checked the translation against the Latin original. His final translations appeared in the volume Fables Ancient and Modern a series of episodes from Homer Ovid and Boccaccio as well as modernised adaptations from Geoffrey Chaucer interspersed with Drydens own poems. As a translator he made great literary works in the older languages available to readers of English. Dryden died on 12 May 1700 and was initially buried in St. Annes cemetery in Soho before being exhumed and reburied in Westminster Abbey ten days later. He was the subject of poetic eulogies such as Luctus Brittannici or the Tears of the British Muses; for the Death of John Dryden Esq. and The Nine Muses. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque commemorates Dryden at 43 Gerrard Street in Londons Chinatown. He lived at 137 Long Acre from 1682 to 1686 and at 43 Gerrard Street from 1686 until his death. In his will he left The George Inn at Northampton to trustees to form a school for the children of the poor of the town. This became John Drydens School later The Orange School. Dryden was the dominant literary figure and influence of his age. He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires religious pieces fables epigrams compliments prologues and plays with it; he also introduced the alexandrine and triplet into the form. In his poems translations and criticism he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic coupletAuden referred to him as the master of the middle stylethat was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century. The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident in the elegies written about him. Drydens heroic couplet became the dominant poetic form of the 18th century. Alexander Pope was heavily influenced by Dryden and often borrowed from him; other writers were equally influenced by Dryden and Pope. Pope famously praised Drydens versification in his imitation of Horaces Epistle II.i Dryden taught to join The varying pause the full resounding line The long majestic march and energy divine. Samuel Johnson summed up the general attitude with his remark that the veneration with which his name is pronounced by every cultivator of English literature is paid to him as he refined the language improved the sentiments and tuned the numbers of English poetry. His poems were very widely read and are often quoted for instance in Henry Fieldings Tom Jones and Johnsons essays. Johnson also noted however that He is therefore with all his variety of excellence not often pathetic; and had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural that he did not esteem them in others. Simplicity gave him no pleasure. Readers in the first half of the 18th century did not mind this too much but later generations considered Drydens absence of sensibility a fault. One of the first attacks on Drydens reputation was by William Wordsworth who complained that Drydens descriptions of natural objects in his translations from Virgil were much inferior to the originals. However several of Wordsworths contemporaries such as George Crabbe Lord Byron and Walter Scott were still keen admirers of Dryden. Besides Wordsworth did admire many of Drydens poems and his famous Intimations of Immortality ode owes something stylistically to Drydens Alexanders Feast. John Keats admired the Fables and imitated them in his poem Lamia. Later 19th-century writers had little use for verse satire Pope or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as classics of our prose. He did have a committed admirer in George Saintsbury and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartletts but the next major poet to take an interest in Dryden was T. S. Eliot who wrote that he was the ancestor of nearly all that is best in the poetry of the eighteenth century and that we cannot fully enjoy or rightly estimate a hundred years of English poetry unless we fully enjoy Dryden. However in the same essay Eliot accused Dryden of having a commonplace mind. Critical interest in Dryden has increased recently but as a relatively straightforward writer his work has not occasioned as much interest as Andrew Marvells John Donnes or Popes. Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in prepositions because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions. Dryden created the proscription against preposition stranding in 1672 when he objected to Ben Jonsons 1611 phrase the bodies that those souls were frighted from though he did not provide the rationale for his preference. Dryden often translated his writing into Latin to check whether his writing was concise and elegant Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then Dryden translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English thus forming the rule of no sentence-ending prepositions subsequently adopted by other writers. The phrase blaze of glory is believed to have originated in Drydens 1686 poem The Hind and the Panther referring to the throne of God as a blaze of glory that forbids the sight. What Dryden achieved in his poetry was neither the emotional excitement of the early nineteenth-century romantics nor the intellectual complexities of the metaphysicals. His subject matter was often factual and he aimed at expressing his thoughts in the most precise and concentrated manner. Although he uses formal structures such as heroic couplets he tried to recreate the natural rhythm of speech and he knew that different subjects need different kinds of verse. In his preface to Religio Laici he says that the expressions of a poem designed purely for instruction ought to be plain and natural yet majestic... The florid elevated and figurative way is for the passions; for are begotten in the soul by showing the objects out of their true proportion.... A man is to be cheated into passion but to be reasoned into truth. While Dryden had many admirers he also had his share of critics Mark Van Doren among them. Van Doren complained that in translating Virgils Aeneid Dryden had added a fund of phrases with which he could expand any passage that seemed to him curt. Dryden did not feel such expansion was a fault arguing that as Latin is a naturally concise language it cannot be duly represented by a comparable number of words in English. He...recognized that Virgil had the advantage of a language wherein much may be comprehended in a little space . The way to please the best Judges...is not to Translate a Poet literally; and Virgil least of any other . For example take lines 789795 of Book 2 when Aeneas sees and receives a message from the ghost of his wife Creusa. I trust our common issue to your care.She said and gliding passd unseen in air.I strove to speak but horror tied my tongue;And thrice about her neck my arms I flungAnd thrice deceivd on vain embraces hung.Light as an empty dream at break of dayOr as a blast of wind she rushd away.Thus having passd the night in fruitless painI to my longing friends return again Drydens translation is based on presumed authorial intent and smooth English. In line 790 the literal translation of haec ubi dicta dedit is when she gave these words. But she said gets the point across uses half the words and makes for better English. A few lines later with ter conatus ibi collo dare bracchia circum; ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago he alters the literal translation Thrice trying to give arms around her neck; thrice the image grasped in vain fled the hands in order to fit it into the metre and the emotion of the scene. The way I have taken is not so streight as Metaphrase nor so loose as Paraphrase Some things too I have omitted and sometimes added of my own. Yet the omissions I hope are but of Circumstances and such as woud have no grace in English; and the Addition I also hope are easily deducd from Virgils Sense. They will seem not struck into him but growing out of him.  In a similar vein Dryden writes in his Preface to the translation anthology Sylvae Where I have taken away some of Expressions and cut them shorter it may possibly be on this consideration that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlargd them I desire the false Criticks would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine but that either they are secretly in the Poet or may be fairly deducd from him; or at least if both those considerations should fail that my own is of a piece with his and that if he were living and an Englishman they are such as he woud probably have written. On 1 December 1663 Dryden married Lady Elizabeth Howard at St Swithins London and the consent of the parents is noted on the licence although Lady Elizabeth was then about twenty-five.  The couple met after 1660 when Dryden began lodging in London with her brother Sir Robert Howard son of the earl of Berkshire. The marriage lasted until his death but there is little evidence about how they lived as a couple. A small estate in Wiltshire was settled upon them by her father. The ladys intellect and temper were apparently not good; her husband was treated as an inferior by those of her social status. Both Dryden and his wife were warmly attached to their children. They had three sons Charles John and Erasmus Henry . Lady Elizabeth Dryden survived her husband but reportedly lost her wits after becoming a widow. Although some have historically claimed to be from the lineage of John Dryden his three children one of whom became a Roman Catholic priest had no children themselves.

Samuel Pepys,Samuel Pepys FRS was an English diarist and naval administrator. He served as administrator of the Royal Navy and Member of Parliament and is most famous for the diary he kept for a decade. Pepys had no maritime experience but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage diligence and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. The detailed private diary that Pepys kept from 1660 until 1669 was first published in the 19thcentury and is one of the most important primary sources for the English Restoration period. It provides a combination of personal revelation and eyewitness accounts of great events such as the Great Plague of London the Second Dutch War and the Great Fire of London. Pepys was born in Salisbury Court Fleet Street London on 23 February 1633 the son of John Pepys a tailor and Margaret Pepys daughter of a Whitechapel butcher. His great uncle Talbot Pepys was Recorder and briefly Member of Parliament for Cambridge in 1625. His fathers first cousin Sir Richard Pepys was elected MP for Sudbury in 1640 appointed Baron of the Exchequer on 30 May 1654 and appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland on 25 September 1655. Pepys was the fifth of 11 children but child mortality was high and he was soon the oldest survivor. He was baptised at St Brides Church on 3 March 1633. Pepys did not spend all of his infancy in London; for a while he was sent to live with nurse Goody Lawrence at Kingsland just north of the city. In about 1644 Pepys attended Huntingdon Grammar School before being educated at St Pauls School London c.1650. He attended the execution of Charles I in 1649. In 1650 he went to the University of Cambridge having received two exhibitions from St Pauls School and a grant from the Mercers Company. In October he was admitted as a sizar to Magdalene College; he moved there in March 1651 and took his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1654. Later in 1654 or early in 1655 he entered the household of one of his fathers cousins Sir Edward Montagu who was later created the 1st Earl of Sandwich. When he was 22 Pepys married 14-year-old Elisabeth de St Michel a descendant of French Huguenot immigrants first in a religious ceremony on 10 October 1655 and later in a civil ceremony on 1 December 1655 at St Margarets Westminster. From a young age Pepys suffered from bladder stones in his urinary tract a condition from which his mother and brother John also later suffered. He was almost never without pain as well as other symptoms including blood in the urine . By the time of his marriage the condition was very severe. In 1657 Pepys decided to undergo surgery; not an easy option as the operation was known to be especially painful and hazardous. Nevertheless Pepys consulted surgeon Thomas Hollier and on 26 March 1658 the operation took place in a bedroom in the house of Pepys cousin Jane Turner. Pepys stone was successfully removed and he resolved to hold a celebration on every anniversary of the operation which he did for several years. However there were long-term effects from the operation. The incision on his bladder broke open again late in his life. The procedure may have left him sterile though there is no direct evidence for this as he was childless before the operation. In mid-1658 Pepys moved to Axe Yard near the modern Downing Street. He worked as a teller in the Exchequer under George Downing. On 1 January 1660 Pepys began to keep a diary. He recorded his daily life for almost 10 years. This record of a decade of Pepys life is more than a million words long and is often regarded as Britains most celebrated diary. Pepys has been called the greatest diarist of all time due to his frankness in writing concerning his own weaknesses and the accuracy with which he records events of daily British life and major events in the 17th century. Pepys wrote about the contemporary court and theatre his household and major political and social occurrences. Historians have been using his diary to gain greater insight and understanding of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances the time he got up in the morning the weather and what he ate. He wrote at length about his new watch which he was very proud of a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded and his cat waking him up at one in the morning. Pepys diary is one of a very few sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper-middle-class man during the 17th century. The descriptions of the lives of his servants like Jane Birch provide a valuable detailed insight into their lives. Aside from day-to-day activities Pepys also commented on the significant and turbulent events of his nation. England was in disarray when he began writing his diary. Oliver Cromwell had died just a few years before creating a period of civil unrest and a large power vacuum to be filled. Pepys had been a strong supporter of Cromwell but he converted to the Royalist cause upon the Protectors death. He was on the ship that returned Charles II to England to take up his throne and gave first-hand accounts of other significant events from the early years of the Restoration such as the coronation of Charles II the Great Plague the Great Fire of London and the AngloDutch Wars. Pepys did not plan on his contemporaries ever seeing his diary which is evident from the fact that he wrote in shorthand and sometimes in a code of various Spanish French and Italian words . However Pepys often juxtaposed profanities in his native English amidst his code of foreign words a practice which would reveal the details to any casual reader. He did intend for future generations to see the diary as evidenced by its inclusion in his library and its catalogue before his death along with the shorthand guide he used and the elaborate planning by which he ensured his library survived intact after his death. The women he pursued his friends and his dealings are all laid out. His diary reveals his jealousies insecurities trivial concerns and his fractious relationship with his wife. It has been an important account of London in the 1660s. The juxtaposition of his commentary on politics and national events alongside the very personal can be seen from the beginning. His opening paragraphs written in January 1660 begin Blessed be God at the end of the last year I was in very good health without any sense of my old pain but upon taking of cold. I lived in Axe yard having my wife and servant Jane and no more in family than us three. My wife after the absence of her terms for seven weeks gave me hopes of her being with child but on the last day of the year she hath them again. The condition of the State was thus. Viz. the Rump after being disturbed by my Lord Lambert was lately returned to sit again. The officers of the army all forced to yield. Lawson lie still in the River and Monke is with his army in Scotland. Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come in to the Parliament; nor is it expected that he will without being forced to it. The entries from the first few months were filled with news of General George Moncks march on London. In April and May of that year he encountered problems with his wife and he accompanied Montagus fleet to the Netherlands to bring Charles II back from exile. Montagu was made Earl of Sandwich on 18 June and Pepys secured the position of Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board on 13 July. As secretary to the board Pepys was entitled to a 350 annual salary plus the various gratuities and benefits that came with the jobincluding bribes. He rejected an offer of 1000 for the position from a rival and soon afterward moved to official accommodation in Seething Lane in the City of London. Pepys stopped writing his diary in 1669. His eyesight began to trouble him and he feared that writing in dim light was damaging his eyes. He did imply in his last entries that he might have others write his diary for him but doing so would result in a loss of privacy and it seems that he never went through with those plans. In the end Pepys lived another 34 years without going blind but he never took to writing his diary again. However Pepys dictated a journal for two months in 166970 as a record of his dealings with the Commissioners of Accounts at that period. He also kept a diary for a few months in 1683 when he was sent to Tangier Morocco as the most senior civil servant in the navy during the English evacuation. The diary mostly covers work-related matters. On the Navy Board Pepys proved to be a more able and efficient worker than colleagues in higher positions. This often annoyed Pepys and provoked much harsh criticism in his diary. Among his colleagues were Admiral Sir William Penn Sir George Carteret Sir John Mennes and Sir William Batten. Pepys learned arithmetic from a private tutor and used models of ships to make up for his lack of first-hand nautical experience and ultimately came to play a significant role in the boards activities. In September 1660 he was made a Justice of the Peace; on 15 February 1662 Pepys was admitted as a Younger Brother of Trinity House; and on 30 April he received the freedom of Portsmouth. Through Sandwich he was involved in the administration of the short-lived English colony at Tangier. He joined the Tangier committee in August 1662 when the colony was first founded and became its treasurer in 1665. In 1663 he independently negotiated a 3000 contract for Norwegian masts demonstrating the freedom of action that his superior abilities allowed. He was appointed to a commission of the royal fishery on 8 April 1664. Pepys job required him to meet many people to dispense money and make contracts. He often laments how he lost his labour having gone to some appointment at a coffee house or tavern only to discover that the person whom he was seeking was not there. These occasions were a constant source of frustration to Pepys. Pepys diary provides a first-hand account of the Restoration and includes detailed accounts of several major events of the 1660s along with the lesser known diary of John Evelyn. In particular it is an invaluable source for the study of the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 16657 the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London in 1666. In relation to the Plague and Fire C. S. Knighton has written From its reporting of these two disasters to the metropolis in which he thrived Pepyss diary has become a national monument.Robert Latham editor of the definitive edition of the diary remarks concerning the Plague and Fire His descriptions of bothagonisingly vividachieve their effect by being something more than superlative reporting; they are written with compassion. As always with Pepys it is people not literary effects that matter. In early 1665 the start of the Second Anglo-Dutch War placed great pressure on Pepys. His colleagues were either engaged elsewhere or incompetent and Pepys had to conduct a great deal of business himself. He excelled under the pressure which was extreme due to the complexity and underfunding of the Royal Navy. At the outset he proposed a centralised approach to supplying the fleet. His idea was accepted and he was made surveyor-general of victualling in October 1665. The position brought a further 300 a year. Pepys wrote about the Second Anglo-Dutch War In all things in wisdom courage force and success the Dutch have the best of us and do end the war with victory on their side. And King Charles II said Dont fight the Dutch imitate them. In 1667 with the war lost Pepys helped to discharge the navy. The Dutch had defeated England on open water and now began to threaten English soil itself. In June 1667 they conducted their Raid on the Medway broke the defensive chain at Gillingham and towed away the Royal Charles one of the Royal Navys most important ships. As he had done during the Fire and the Plague Pepys again removed his wife and his gold from London. The Dutch raid was a major concern in itself but Pepys was personally placed under a different kind of pressure the Navy Board and his role as Clerk of the Acts came under scrutiny from the public and from Parliament. The war ended in August and on 17 October the House of Commons created a committee of miscarriages. On 20 October a list was demanded from Pepys of ships and commanders at the time of the division of the fleet in 1666. However these demands were actually quite desirable for him as tactical and strategic mistakes were not the responsibility of the Navy Board. The Board did face some allegations regarding the Medway raid but they could exploit the criticism already attracted by Commissioner of Chatham Peter Pett to deflect criticism from themselves. The committee accepted this tactic when they reported in February 1668. The Board was however criticised for its use of tickets to pay seamen. These tickets could only be exchanged for cash at the Navys treasury in London. Pepys made a long speech at the bar of the Commons on 5 March 1668 defending this practice. It was in the words of C. S. Knighton a virtuoso performance. The commission was followed by an investigation led by a more powerful authority the commissioners of accounts. They met at Brooke House Holborn and spent two years scrutinising how the war had been financed. In 1669 Pepys had to prepare detailed answers to the committees eight Observations on the Navy Boards conduct. In 1670 he was forced to defend his own role. A seamans ticket with Pepys name on it was produced as incontrovertible evidence of his corrupt dealings but thanks to the intervention of the king Pepys emerged from the sustained investigation relatively unscathed. Outbreaks of plague were not unusual events in London; major epidemics had occurred in 1592 1603 1625 and 1636. Furthermore Pepys was not among the group of people who were most at risk. He did not live in cramped housing he did not routinely mix with the poor and he was not required to keep his family in London in the event of a crisis. It was not until June 1665 that the unusual seriousness of the plague became apparent so Pepys activities in the first five months of 1665 were not significantly affected by it.Claire Tomalin wrote that 1665 was to Pepys one of the happiest years of his life. He worked very hard that year and the outcome was that he quadrupled his fortune. In his annual summary on 31 December he wrote I have never lived so merrily as I have done this plague time. Nonetheless Pepys was certainly concerned about the plague. On 16 August he wrote But Lord how sad a sight it is to see the streets empty of people and very few upon the Change. Jealous of every door that one sees shut up lest it should be the plague; and about us two shops in three if not more generally shut up. He also chewed tobacco as a protection against infection and worried that wig-makers might be using hair from the corpses as a raw material. Furthermore it was Pepys who suggested that the Navy Office should evacuate to Greenwich although he did offer to remain in town himself. He later took great pride in his stoicism. Meanwhile Elisabeth Pepys was sent to Woolwich. She did not return to Seething Lane until January 1666 and was shocked by the sight of St Olaves churchyard where 300 people had been buried. In the early hours of 2 September 1666 Pepys was awakened by Jane the maid his servant who had spotted a fire in the Billingsgate area. He decided that the fire was not particularly serious and returned to bed. Shortly after waking his servant returned and reported that 300 houses had been destroyed and that London Bridge was threatened. Pepys went to the Tower of London to get a better view. Without returning home he took a boat and observed the fire for over an hour. In his diary Pepys recorded his observations as follows I down to the water-side and there got a boat and through bridge and there saw a lamentable fire. Poor Michells house as far as the Old Swan already burned that way and the fire running further that in a very little time it got as far as the Steeleyard while I was there. Everybody endeavouring to remove their goods and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that layoff; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them and then running into boats or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another. And among other things the poor pigeons I perceive were loth to leave their houses but hovered about the windows and balconys till they were some of them burned their wings and fell down. Having staid and in an hours time seen the fire rage every way and nobody to my sight endeavouring to quench it but to remove their goods and leave all to the fire and having seen it get as far as the Steele-yard and the wind mighty high and driving it into the City; and every thing after so long a drought proving combustible even the very stones of churches and among other things the poor steeple by which pretty Mrs. lives and whereof my old school-fellow Elborough is parson taken fire in the very top and there burned till it fell down... The wind was driving the fire westward so he ordered the boat to go to Whitehall and became the first person to inform the king of the fire. According to his entry of 2 September 1666 Pepys recommended to the king that homes be pulled down in the path of the fire in order to stem its progress. Accepting this advice the king told him to go to Lord Mayor Thomas Bloodworth and tell him to start pulling down houses. Pepys took a coach back as far as St Pauls Cathedral before setting off on foot through the burning city. He found the Lord Mayor who said Lord what can I do I am spent people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it. At noon he returned home and had an extraordinary good dinner and as merry as at this time we could be before returning to watch the fire in the city once more. Later he returned to Whitehall then met his wife in St Jamess Park. In the evening they watched the fire from the safety of Bankside. Pepys writes that it made me weep to see it. Returning home Pepys met his clerk Tom Hayter who had lost everything. Hearing news that the fire was advancing he started to pack up his possessions by moonlight. A cart arrived at 4 a.m. on 3 September and Pepys spent much of the day arranging the removal of his possessions. Many of his valuables including his diary were sent to a friend from the Navy Office at Bethnal Green. At night he fed upon the remains of yesterdays dinner having no fire nor dishes nor any opportunity of dressing any thing. The next day Pepys continued to arrange the removal of his possessions. By then he believed that Seething Lane was in grave danger so he suggested calling men from Deptford to help pull down houses and defend the kings property. He described the chaos in the city and his curious attempt at saving his own goods Sir W. Pen and I to Tower-streete and there met the fire burning three or four doors beyond Mr. Howells whose goods poor man his trayes and dishes shovells c. were flung all along Tower-street in the kennels and people working therewith from one end to the other; the fire coming on in that narrow streete on both sides with infinite fury. Sir W. Batten not knowing how to remove his wine did dig a pit in the garden and laid it in there; and I took the opportunity of laying all the papers of my office that I could not otherwise dispose of. And in the evening Sir W. Pen and I did dig another and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan cheese as well as my wine and some other things. Pepys had taken to sleeping on his office floor; on Wednesday 5 September he was awakened by his wife at 2 a.m. She told him that the fire had almost reached All Hallows-by-the-Tower and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold about 2350 to Woolwich. In the following days Pepys witnessed looting disorder and disruption. On 7 September he went to Pauls Wharf and saw the ruins of St Pauls Cathedral of his old school of his fathers house and of the house in which he had had his bladder stone removed. Despite all this destruction Pepys house office and diary were saved. The diary gives a detailed account of Pepys personal life. He was fond of wine plays and the company of other people. He also spent time evaluating his fortune and his place in the world. He was always curious and often acted on that curiosity as he acted upon almost all his impulses. Periodically he would resolve to devote more time to hard work instead of leisure. For example in his entry for New Years Eve 1661 he writes I have newly taken a solemn oath about abstaining from plays and wine The following months reveal his lapses to the reader; by 17 February it is recorded Here I drank wine upon necessity being ill for the want of it. Pepys was one of the most important civil servants of his age and was also a widely cultivated man taking an interest in books music the theatre and science. Aside from English he was fluent in French and read many texts in Latin. His favourite author was Virgil. He was passionately interested in music; he composed sang and played for pleasure and even arranged music lessons for his servants. He played the lute viol violin flageolet recorder and spinet to varying degrees of proficiency. He was also a keen singer performing at home in coffee houses and even in Westminster Abbey. He and his wife took flageolet lessons from master Thomas Greeting. He also taught his wife to sing and paid for dancing lessons for her . Pepys was an investor in the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa which held the Royal monopoly on trading along the west coast of Africa in gold silver ivory and slaves. Propriety did not prevent him from engaging in a number of extramarital liaisons with various women that were chronicled in his diary often in some detail when relating the intimate details. The most dramatic of these encounters was with Deborah Willet a young woman engaged as a companion for Elisabeth Pepys. On 25 October 1668 Pepys was surprised by his wife as he embraced Deb Willet; he writes that his wife coming up suddenly did find me imbracing the girl con in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also.... Following this event he was characteristically filled with remorse but continued to pursue Willet after she had been dismissed from the Pepys household. Pepys also had a habit of fondling the breasts of his maid Mary Mercer while she dressed him in the morning. Pepys may also have dallied with a leading actress of the Restoration period Mary Knep. Mrs Knep was the wife of a Smithfield horsedealer and the mistress of Pepysor at least she granted him a share of her favours. Scholars disagree on the full extent of the PepysKnep relationship but much of later generations knowledge of Knep comes from the diary. Pepys first met Knep on 6 December 1665. He described her as pretty enough but the most excellent mad-humoured thing and sings the noblest that I ever heard in my life. He called her husband an ill melancholy jealous-looking fellow and suspected him of abusing his wife. Knep provided Pepys with backstage access and was a conduit for theatrical and social gossip. When they wrote notes to each other Pepys signed himself Dapper Dickey while Knep was Barbry Allen .Pepys reference to purchasing the pornographic book LEscole des Filles appears to be the first English reference to pornography. He writes in his diary that it was a mighty lewd book and burned it after reading it. The diary was written in one of the many standard forms of shorthand used in Pepys time in this case called tachygraphy and devised by Thomas Shelton. It is clear from its content that it was written as a purely personal record of his life and not for publication yet there are indications that Pepys took steps to preserve the bound manuscripts of his diary. He wrote it out in fair copy from rough notes and he also had the loose pages bound into six volumes catalogued them in his library with all his other books and is likely to have suspected that eventually someone would find them interesting. This tree summarizes in a more compact form and with a few additional details trees published elsewhere in a box-like form. It is meant to help the reader of the Diary and also integrates some biographical information found in the same sources. Pepys health suffered from the long hours that he worked throughout the period of the diary. Specifically he believed that his eyesight had been affected by his work. He reluctantly concluded in his last entry dated 31 May 1669 that he should completely stop writing for the sake of his eyes and only dictate to his clerks from then on which meant that he could no longer keep his diary. Pepys and his wife took a holiday to France and the Low Countries in JuneOctober 1669; on their return Elisabeth fell ill and died on 10 November 1669. Pepys erected a monument to her in the church of St Olaves Hart Street London. Pepys never remarried but he did have a long-term housekeeper named Mary Skinner who was assumed by many of his contemporaries to be his mistress and sometimes referred to as Mrs. Pepys. In his will he left her an annuity of 200 and many of his possessions. In 1672 he became an Elder Brother of Trinity House and served in this capacity until 1689; he was Master of Trinity House in 16761677 and again in 16851686. In 1673 he was promoted to Secretary of the Admiralty Commission and elected MP for Castle Rising in Norfolk. In 1673 he was involved with the establishment of the Royal Mathematical School at Christs Hospital which was to train 40 boys annually in navigation for the benefit of the Royal Navy and the English Merchant Navy. In 1675 he was appointed a Governor of Christs Hospital and for many years he took a close interest in its affairs. Among his papers are two detailed memorandas on the administration of the school. In 1699 after the successful conclusion of a seven-year campaign to get the master of the Mathematical School replaced by a man who knew more about the sea he was rewarded for his service as a Governor by being made a Freeman of the City of London. He also served as Master of the Clothworkers Company . At the beginning of 1679 Pepys was elected MP for Harwich in Charles IIs third parliament which formed part of the Cavalier Parliament. He was elected along with Sir Anthony Deane a Harwich alderman and leading naval architect to whom Pepys had been a patron since 1662. By May of that year they were under attack from their political enemies. Pepys resigned as Secretary of the Admiralty. They were imprisoned in the Tower of London on suspicion of treasonable correspondence with France specifically leaking naval intelligence. The charges are believed to have been fabricated under the direction of Anthony Ashley-Cooper 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Pepys was accused among other things of being a secret member of the Catholic Church in England. Pepys and Deane were released in July but proceedings against them were not dropped until June 1680. Though he had resigned from the Tangier committee in 1679 in 1683 he was sent to Tangier to assist Lord Dartmouth with the evacuation and abandonment of the English colony. After six months service he travelled back through Spain accompanied by the naval engineer Edmund Dummer returning to England after a particularly rough passage on 30 March 1684. In June 1684 once more in favour he was appointed Kings Secretary for the affairs of the Admiralty a post that he retained after the death of Charles II and the accession of James II. The phantom Pepys Island alleged to be near South Georgia was named after him in 1684 having been first discovered during his tenure at the Admiralty. From 1685 to 1688 he was active not only as Secretary of the Admiralty but also as MP for Harwich. He had been elected MP for Sandwich but this election was contested and he immediately withdrew to Harwich. When James fled the country at the end of 1688 Pepyss career also came to an end. In January 1689 he was defeated in the parliamentary election at Harwich; in February one week after the accession of William III and Mary II he resigned his secretaryship. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1665 and served as its President from 1 December 1684 to 30 November 1686. Isaac Newtons Principia Mathematica was published during this period and its title page bears Pepys name. There is a probability problem called the NewtonPepys problem that arose out of correspondence between Newton and Pepys about whether one is more likely to roll at least one six with six dice or at least two sixes with twelve dice. It has only recently been noted that the gambling advice that Newton gave Pepys was correct while the logical argument with which Newton accompanied it was unsound. He was imprisoned on suspicion of Jacobitism from May to July 1689 and again in June 1690 but no charges were ever successfully brought against him. After his release he retired from public life at age 57. He moved out of London 10 years later to a house in Clapham owned by his friend William Hewer who had begun his career working for Pepys in the admiralty. Clapham was in the country at the time; it is now part of inner London. Pepys lived there until his death on 26 May 1703. He had no children and bequeathed his estate to his unmarried nephew John Jackson. Pepys had disinherited his nephew Samuel Jackson for marrying contrary to his wishes. When John Jackson died in 1724 Pepys estate reverted to Anne daughter of Archdeacon Samuel Edgeley niece of Will Hewer and sister of Hewer Edgeley nephew and godson of Pepys old Admiralty employee and friend Will Hewer. Hewer was also childless and left his immense estate to his nephew Hewer Edgeley on condition that the nephew would adopt the surname Hewer. So Will Hewers heir became Hewer Edgeley-Hewer and he adopted the old Will Hewer home in Clapham as his residence. That is how the Edgeley family acquired the estates of both Samuel Pepys and Will Hewer with sister Anne inheriting Pepys estate and brother Hewer inheriting that of Will Hewer. On the death of Hewer Edgeley-Hewer in 1728 the old Hewer estate went to Edgeley-Hewers widow Elizabeth who left the 432-acre estate to Levett Blackborne the son of Abraham Blackborne merchant of Clapham and other family members who later sold it off in lots. Lincolns Inn barrister Levett Blackborne also later acted as attorney in legal scuffles for the heirs who had inherited the Pepys estate. Pepys former protégé and friend Hewer acted as the executor of Pepyss estate. Pepys was buried along with his wife in St Olaves Church Hart Street in London. Pepys was a lifelong bibliophile and carefully nurtured his large collection of books manuscripts and prints. At his death there were more than 3000 volumes including the diary all carefully catalogued and indexed; they form one of the most important surviving 17th-century private libraries. The most important items in the Library are the six original bound manuscripts of Pepys diary but there are other remarkable holdings including Pepys made detailed provisions in his will for the preservation of his book collection. His nephew and heir John Jackson died in 1723 when it was transferred intact to Magdalene College Cambridge where it can be seen in the Pepys Library. The bequest included all the original bookcases and his elaborate instructions that placement of the books be strictly reviewed and where found requiring it more nicely adjusted. The Ephemera Society emblem uses Pepys portrait and characterizes him as the first general ephemerist. Two large albums of ephemera saved by Pepys are in his library. Motivated by the publication of John Evelyns Diary in 1818 Lord Granville deciphered a few pages.John Smith was then engaged to transcribe the diaries into plain English. He laboured at this task for three years from 1819 to 1822 unaware until nearly finished that a key to the shorthand system was stored in Pepys library a few shelves above the diary volumes. Others had apparently succeeded in reading the diary earlier perhaps knowing about the key because a work of 1812 quotes from a passage of it. Smiths transcription which is also kept in the Pepys Library was the basis for the first published edition of the diary edited by Lord Braybrooke released in two volumes in 1825. A second transcription done with the benefit of the key but often less accurately was completed in 1875 by Mynors Bright and published in 18751879. This added about a third to the previously published text but still left only about 80 of the diary in print.Henry B. Wheatley drawing on both his predecessors produced a new edition in 18931899 revised in 1926 with extensive notes and an index. All of these editions omitted passages that the editors thought were too obscene ever to be printed. Wheatley in the preface to his edition noted a few passages which cannot possibly be printed. It may be thought by some that these omissions are due to an unnecessary squeamishness but it is not really so and readers are therefore asked to have faith in the judgement of the editor. Wheatley claims to have indicated all such omissions with an ellipsis but comparison with the modern text indicates that he did not always do this and that he silently bowdlerised a number of words. The complete unexpurgated and definitive edition edited and transcribed by Robert Latham and William Matthews was published by Bell Hyman London and the University of California Press Berkeley in nine volumes along with separate Companion and Index volumes over the years 19701983. Various single-volume abridgements of this text are also available. The Introduction in Volume I provides a scholarly but readable account of The Diarist The Diary History of Previous Editions The Diary as Literature and The Diary as History. The Companion provides a long series of detailed essays about Pepys and his world. The first unabridged recording of the diary as an audiobook was published in 2015 by Naxos AudioBooks. On 1 January 2003 Phil Gyford started a weblog pepysdiary.com that serialised the diary one day each evening together with annotations from the public and experts alike. In December 2003 the blog won the best specialist blog award in The Guardians Best of British Blogs. In 2021 Gyford noted the existence of the Samuel Pepys Twitter account; set up in 2008 the account similarly serialises Pepys diary each day. In 1958 the BBC produced a serial called Samuel Pepys in which Peter Sallis played the title role. In 2003 a television film The Private Life of Samuel Pepys aired on BBC2 in which Steve Coogan played Pepys. The 2004 film Stage Beauty concerns London theatre in the 17th century and is based on Jeffrey Hatchers play Compleat Female Stage Beauty which in turn was inspired by a reference in Pepys diary to the actor Edward Kynaston who played female roles in the days when women were forbidden to appear on stage. Pepys is a character in the film and is portrayed as an ardent devotee of the theatre. Hugh Bonneville plays Pepys. Daniel Mays portrays Pepys in The Great Fire a 2014 BBC television miniseries. Pepys has also been portrayed in various other film and television productions played by diverse actors including Mervyn Johns Michael Palin Michael Graham Cox and Philip Jackson. BBC Radio 4 has broadcast serialised radio dramatisations of the diary. In the 1990s it was performed as a Classic Serial starring Bill Nighy and in the 2010s it was serialised as part of the Womans Hour radio magazine programme. One audiobook edition of Pepys diary selections is narrated by Kenneth Branagh. A fictionalised Pepys narrates the second chapter of Harry Turtledoves science fiction novel A Different Flesh . This chapter is entitled And So to Bed and written in the form of entries from the Pepys diary. The entries detail Pepys encounter with American Homo erectus specimens and his formation of the transformational theory of life thus causing evolutionary theory to gain a foothold in scientific thought in the 17th century rather than the 19th. Deborah Swifts 2017 novel Pleasing Mr Pepys is described as a re-imagining of the events in Samuel Pepyss Diary. Several detailed studies of Pepys life are available. Arthur Bryant published his three-volume study in 19331938 long before the definitive edition of the diary but thanks to Bryants lively style it is still of interest. In 1974 Richard Ollard produced a new biography that drew on Lathams and Matthews work on the text benefiting from the authors deep knowledge of Restoration politics. Other biographies include Samuel Pepys A Life by Stephen Coote and Samuel Pepys and His World by Geoffrey Trease . The most recent general study Samuel Pepys the Unequalled Self is by Claire Tomalin. Tomalins book won the 2002 Whitbread Book of the Year award the judges calling it a rich thoughtful and deeply satisfying account that unearths a wealth of material about the uncharted life of Samuel Pepys.
John Locke,John Locke FRS was an English philosopher and physician widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the father of liberalism. Considered one of the first of the British empiricists following the tradition of Francis Bacon Locke is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers as well as the American Revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence. Internationally Lockes political-legal principles continue to have a profound influence on the theory and practice of limited representative government and the protection of basic rights and freedoms under the rule of law. Lockes theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau David Hume and Immanuel Kant. He postulated that at birth the mind was a blank slate or tabula rasa. Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts he maintained that we are born without innate ideas and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception a concept now known as empiricism. Locke was born on 29 August 1632 in a small thatched cottage by the church in Wrington Somerset about 12 miles from Bristol. He was baptised the same day as both of his parents were Puritans. Lockes father also named John was an attorney who served as clerk to the Justices of the Peace in Chew Magna and as a captain of cavalry for the Parliamentarian forces during the early part of the English Civil War. His mother was Agnes Keene. Soon after Lockes birth the family moved to the market town of Pensford about seven miles south of Bristol where Locke grew up in a rural Tudor house in Belluton. In 1647 Locke was sent to the prestigious Westminster School in London under the sponsorship of Alexander Popham a member of Parliament and John Sr.s former commander. At the age of 16 he was at school just half a mile away from the execution of Charles I; however the boys were not allowed to go and watch. After completing studies at Westminster he was admitted to Christ Church Oxford in the autumn of 1652 at the age of 20. The dean of the college at the time was John Owen vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found the works of modern philosophers such as René Descartes more interesting than the classical material taught at the university. Through his friend Richard Lower whom he knew from the Westminster School Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the Royal Society of which he eventually became a member. Locke was awarded a bachelors degree in February 1656 and a masters degree in June 1658. He obtained a bachelor of medicine in February 1675 having studied the subject extensively during his time at Oxford and in addition to Lower worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as Robert Boyle Thomas Willis and Robert Hooke. In 1666 he met Anthony Ashley Cooper Lord Ashley who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection. Ashley was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue. Locke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Ashleys home at Exeter House in London to serve as his personal physician. In London Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of Thomas Sydenham. Sydenham had a major effect on Lockes natural philosophical thinkingan effect that would become evident in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Lockes medical knowledge was put to the test when Ashleys liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Ashley to undergo surgery to remove the cyst. Ashley survived and prospered crediting Locke with saving his life. During this time Locke served as Secretary of the Board of Trade and Plantations and Secretary to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics. Ashley as a founder of the Whig movement exerted great influence on Lockes political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Ashley became Lord Chancellor in 1672 . Following Shaftesburys fall from favour in 1675 Locke spent some time travelling across France as a tutor and medical attendant to Caleb Banks. He returned to England in 1679 when Shaftesburys political fortunes took a brief positive turn. Around this time most likely at Shaftesburys prompting Locke composed the bulk of the Two Treatises of Government. While it was once thought that Locke wrote the Treatises to defend the Glorious Revolution of 1688 recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date. The work is now viewed as a more general argument against absolute monarchy and for individual consent as the basis of political legitimacy. Although Locke was associated with the influential Whigs his ideas about natural rights and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history. Locke fled to the Netherlands in 1683 under strong suspicion of involvement in the Rye House Plot although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme. The philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein argues that during his five years in Holland Locke chose his friends from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as Spinozas small group of loyal confidants. Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who... insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone. While she says that Lockes strong empiricist tendencies would have disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinozas Ethics in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinozas ideas most particularly to the rationalists well thought out argument for political and religious tolerance and the necessity of the separation of church and state. In the Netherlands Locke had time to return to his writing spending a great deal of time working on the Essay Concerning Human Understanding and composing the Letter on Toleration. Locke did not return home until after the Glorious Revolution. Locke accompanied Mary II back to England in 1689. The bulk of Lockes publishing took place upon his return from exilehis aforementioned Essay Concerning Human Understanding the Two Treatises of Government and A Letter Concerning Toleration all appearing in quick succession. Lockes close friend Lady Masham invited him to join her at Otes the Mashams country house in Essex. Although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs. During this period he discussed matters with such figures as John Dryden and Isaac Newton. He died on 28 October 1704 and is buried in the churchyard of the village of High Laver east of Harlow in Essex where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691. Locke never married nor had children. Events that happened during Lockes lifetime include the English Restoration the Great Plague of London the Great Fire of London and the Glorious Revolution. He did not see the Act of Union of 1707 but the thrones of England and Scotland were held in personal union throughout his lifetime. Constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy were in their infancy during Lockes time. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries Lockes Two Treatises were rarely cited. Historian Julian Hoppit said of the book except among some Whigs even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 .John Kenyon in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720 has remarked that Lockes theories were mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke. In contrast Kenyon adds that Algernon Sidneys Discourses Concerning Government were certainly much more influential than Lockes Two Treatises. In the 50 years after Queen Annes death in 1714 the Two Treatises were reprinted only once . However with the rise of American resistance to British taxation the Second Treatise of Government gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain. The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston. Bacon Locke and Newton I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived without any exception and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences. However Lockes influence may have been even more profound in the realm of epistemology. Locke redefined subjectivity or self leading intellectual historians such as Charles Taylor and Jerrold Seigel to argue that Lockes An Essay Concerning Human Understanding marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the self. Lockes theory of association heavily influenced the subject matter of modern psychology. At the time Lockes recognition of two types of ideas simple and complexand more importantly their interaction through associationinspired other philosophers such as David Hume and George Berkeley to revise and expand this theory and apply it to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world. Locke thought the states borders and the functioning and enforcement of the existence of the state and its constitution were metaphysically tied to the natural rights of the individual and this inspired future liberal politicians and philosophers. Writing his Letters Concerning Toleration in the aftermath of the European wars of religion Locke formulated a classic reasoning for religious tolerance in which three arguments are central With regard to his position on religious tolerance Locke was influenced by Baptist theologians like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys who had published tracts demanding freedom of conscience in the early 17th century. Baptist theologian Roger Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island in 1636 where he combined a democratic constitution with unlimited religious freedom. His tract The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience which was widely read in the mother country was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total separation of church and state. Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological philosophical and political agenda as Martin Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms in 1521 unless he would be proved false by the Bible. Lockes views on slavery were multifaceted and complex. Although he wrote against slavery in general Locke was an investor and beneficiary of the slave-trading Royal Africa Company. In addition while secretary to the Earl of Shaftesbury Locke participated in drafting the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina which established a quasi-feudal aristocracy and gave Carolinian planters absolute power over their enslaved chattel property; the constitutions pledged that every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves. Philosopher Martin Cohen notes that Locke as secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations and a member of the Board of Trade was one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude.According to American historian James Farr Locke never expressed any thoughts concerning his contradictory opinions regarding slavery which Farr ascribes to his personal involvement in the slave trade. Lockes positions on slavery have been described as hypocritical and laying the foundation for the Founding Fathers to hold similarly contradictory thoughts regarding freedom and slavery. Historian Holly Brewer has argued however that Lockes role in the Constitution of Carolina has been exaggerated and that he was merely paid to revise and make copies of a document that had already been partially written before he became involved; she compares Lockes role to a lawyer writing a will. She further says that Locke was paid in Royal African Company stock in lieu of money for his work as a secretary for a governmental sub-committee and that he sold the stock after a few years. Brewer likewise argues that Locke actively worked to undermine slavery in Virginia while heading a Board of Trade created by William of Orange following the Glorious Revolution. He specifically attacked colonial policy granting land to slave owners and encouraged the baptism and Christian education of the children of enslaved Africans to undercut a major justification of slaverythat they were heathens who possessed no rights. In his Two Treatises of Government Locke provided a justification for slavery that could never actually be met thus rendering all forms of slavery as it actually existed invalid. Moreover as one may not submit to slavery in Lockes view there is a moral injunction to attempt to throw off and escape it whenever it looms. Locke also supported child labour which was an intrinsic part of all pre-industrial societies. In his Essay on the Poor Law he turns to the education of the poor; he laments that the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish and are usually maintained in idleness so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old. He suggests therefore that working schools be set up in each parish in England for poor children so that they will be from infancy inured to work. He goes on to outline the economics of these schools arguing not only that they will be profitable for the parish but also that they will instil a good work ethic in the children. Lockes political theory was founded upon that of social contract. Unlike Thomas Hobbes Locke believed that human nature is characterised by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes however Locke believed that human nature allows people to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a natural state all people were equal and independent and everyone had a natural right to defend his life health liberty or possessions. Most scholars trace the phrase Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness in the American Declaration of Independence to Lockes theory of rights although other origins have been suggested. Like Hobbes Locke assumed that the sole right to defend in the state of nature was not enough so people established a civil society to resolve conflicts in a civil way with help from government in a state of society. However Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day. Locke also advocated governmental separation of powers and believed that revolution is not only a right but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. According to Locke unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature but with the introduction of durable goods men could exchange their excessive perishable goods for those which would last longer and thus not offend the natural law. In his view the introduction of money marked the culmination of this process making possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage. He also includes gold or silver as money because they may be hoarded up without injury to anyone as they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor. In his view the introduction of money eliminates limits to accumulation. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property. Locke is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem. However not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example the labour theory of value in the Two Treatises of Government stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory of value developed in a letter he wrote titled Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money. Moreover Locke anchors property in labour but in the end upholds unlimited accumulation of wealth. Lockes general theory of value and price is a supply-and-demand theory set out in a letter to a member of parliament in 1691 titled Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money. In it he refers to supply as quantity and demand as rent The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers and that which regulates the price is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent. The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on money answers all things or rent of money is always sufficient or more than enough and varies very little. Locke concludes that as far as money is concerned the demand for it is exclusively regulated by its quantity regardless of whether the demand is unlimited or constant. He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For supply he explains the value of goods as based on their scarcity and ability to be exchanged and consumed. He explains demand for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income. Locke develops an early theory of capitalisation such as of land which has value because by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income. He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange. As a medium of exchange he states money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life and for loanable funds it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly incomeor interest. Locke distinguishes two functions of money as a counter to measure value and as a pledge to lay claim to goods. He believes that silver and gold as opposed to paper money are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold he says are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it. Locke argues that a country should seek a favourable balance of trade lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world money stock grows constantly a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock. Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges in addition to commodity movements there are also movements in country stock of money and movements of capital determine exchange rates. He considers the latter less significant and less volatile than commodity movements. As for a countrys money stock if it is large relative to that of other countries he says it will cause the countrys exchange to rise above par as an export balance would do. He also prepares estimates of the cash requirements for different economic groups . In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokersthe middlemenwhose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute. Locke uses the concept of property in both broad and narrow terms broadly it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more particularly it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right that is derived from labour. In Chapter V of his Second Treatise Locke argues that the individual ownership of goods and property is justified by the labour exerted to produce such goodsat least where there is enough and as good left in common for others or to use property to produce goods beneficial to human society. Locke states in his Second Treatise that nature on its own provides little of value to society implying that the labour expended in the creation of goods gives them their value. From this premise understood as a labour theory of value Locke developed a labour theory of property whereby ownership of property is created by the application of labour. In addition he believed that property precedes government and government cannot dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily. Karl Marx later critiqued Lockes theory of property in his own social theory. Locke defines the self as that conscious thinking thing which is sensible or conscious of pleasure and pain capable of happiness or misery and so is concerned for itself as far as that consciousness extends. He does not however wholly ignore substance writing that the body too goes to the making the man. In his Essay Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind. Arguing against both the Augustinian view of man as originally sinful and the Cartesian position which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions Locke posits an empty mind a tabula rasa which is shaped by experience; sensations and reflections being the two sources of all of our ideas. He states in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding This source of ideas every man has wholly within himself; and though it be not sense as having nothing to do with external objects yet it is very like it and might properly enough be called internal sense. I think I may say that of all the men we meet with nine parts of ten are what they are good or evil useful or not by their education. Locke also wrote that the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences. He argues that the associations of ideas that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the self; they are put differently what first mark the tabula rasa. In his Essay in which both these concepts are introduced Locke warns for example against letting a foolish maid convince a child that goblins and sprites are associated with the night for darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas and they shall be so joined that he can no more bear the one than the other. This theory came to be called associationism going on to strongly influence 18th-century thought particularly educational theory as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of psychology and other new disciplines with David Hartleys attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his Observations on Man . Locke was critical of Descartess version of the dream argument with Locke making the counter-argument that people cannot have physical pain in dreams as they do in waking life. Some scholars have seen Lockes political convictions as being based from his religious beliefs. Lockes religious trajectory began in Calvinist trinitarianism but by the time of the Reflections Locke was advocating not just Socinian views on tolerance but also Socinian Christology. However Wainwright notes that in the posthumously published Paraphrase Lockes interpretation of one verse Ephesians 110 is markedly different from that of Socinians like Biddle and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an Arian position thereby accepting Christs pre-existence.Locke was at times not sure about the subject of original sin so he was accused of Socinianism Arianism or Deism. Locke argued that the idea that all Adams Posterity doomed to Eternal Infinite Punishment for the Transgression of Adam was little consistent with the Justice or Goodness of the Great and Infinite God leading Eric Nelson to associate him with Pelagian ideas. However he did not deny the reality of evil. Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes. Criminals had to be punished even with the death penalty. With regard to the Bible Locke was very conservative. He retained the doctrine of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures. The miracles were proof of the divine nature of the biblical message. Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason . Although Locke was an advocate of tolerance he urged the authorities not to tolerate atheism because he thought the denial of Gods existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos. That excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises. In Lockes opinion the cosmological argument was valid and proved Gods existence. His political thought was based on Protestant Christian views. Additionally Locke advocated a sense of piety out of gratitude to God for giving reason to men. Lockes concept of man started with the belief in creation. Like philosophers Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf Locke equated natural law with the biblical revelation. Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts in particular from Genesis 1 and 2 the Decalogue the Golden Rule the teachings of Jesus and the letters of Paul the Apostle.The Decalogue puts a persons life reputation and property under Gods protection. Lockes philosophy on freedom is also derived from the Bible. Locke derived from the Bible basic human equality the starting point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. To Locke one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed. Locke compared the English monarchys rule over the British people to Adams rule over Eve in Genesis which was appointed by God. Following Lockes philosophy the American Declaration of Independence founded human rights partially on the biblical belief in creation. Lockes doctrine that governments need the consent of the governed is also central to the Declaration of Independence. Locke was an assiduous book collector and notetaker throughout his life. By his death in 1704 Locke had amassed a library of more than 3000 books a significant number in the seventeenth century. Unlike some of his contemporaries Locke took care to catalogue and preserve his library and his will made specific provisions for how his library was to be distributed after his death. Lockes will offered Lady Masham the choice of any four folios eight quartos and twenty books of less volume which she shall choose out of the books in my Library. Locke also gave six titles to his good friend Anthony Collins but Locke bequeathed the majority of his collection to his cousin Peter King and to Lady Mashams son Francis Cudworth Masham. Francis Masham was promised one moiety of Lockes library when he reached the age of one and twenty years. The other moiety of Lockes books along with his manuscripts passed to his cousin King. Over the next two centuries the Masham portion of Lockes library was dispersed. The manuscripts and books left to King however remained with Kings descendants until most of the collection was bought by the Bodleian Library Oxford in 1947. Another portion of the books Locke left to King was discovered by the collector and philanthropist Paul Mellon in 1951. Mellon supplemented this discovery with books from Lockes library which he bought privately and in 1978 he transferred his collection to the Bodleian. The holdings in the Locke Room at the Bodleian have been a valuable resource for scholars interested in Locke his philosophy practices for information management and the history of the book. Many of the books still contain Lockes signature which he often made on the pastedowns of his books. Many also include Lockes marginalia. The printed books in Lockes library reflected his various intellectual interests as well as his movements at different stages of his life. Locke travelled extensively in France and the Netherlands during the 1670s and 1680s and during this time he acquired many books from the continent. Only half of the books in Lockes library were printed in England while close to 40 came from France and the Netherlands. These books cover a wide range of subjects. According to John Harrison and Peter Laslett the largest genres in Lockes library were theology medicine politics and law and classical literature . The Bodleian library currently holds more than 800 of the books from Lockes library. These include Lockes copies of works by several of the most influential figures of the seventeenth century including In addition to books owned by Locke the Bodleian also possesses more than 100 manuscripts related to Locke or written in his hand. Like the books in Lockes library these manuscripts display a range of interests and provide different windows into Lockes activity and relationships. Several of the manuscripts include letters to and from acquaintances like Peter King and Nicolas Toinard . MS Locke f. 110 contain Lockes journals for most years between 1675 and 1704. Some of the most significant manuscripts include early drafts of Lockes writings such as his Essay Concerning Human Understanding . The Bodleian also holds a copy of Robert Boyles General History of the Air with corrections and notes Locke made while preparing Boyles work for posthumous publication . Other manuscripts contain unpublished works. Among others MS. Locke e. 18 includes some of Lockes thoughts on the Glorious Revolution which Locke sent to his friend Edward Clarke but never published. One of the largest categories of manuscript at the Bodleian comprises Lockes notebooks and commonplace books. The scholar Richard Yeo calls Locke a Master Note-taker and explains that Lockes methodical note-taking pervaded most areas of his life. In an unpublished essay Of Study Locke argued that a notebook should work like a chest-of-drawers for organizing information which would be a great help to the memory and means to avoid confusion in our thoughts. Locke kept several notebooks and commonplace books which he organized according to topic. MS Locke c. 43 includes Lockes notes on theology while MS Locke f. 1824 contain medical notes. Other notebooks such as MS c. 43 incorporate several topics in the same notebook but separated into sections. These commonplace books were highly personal and were designed to be used by Locke himself rather than accessible to a wide audience. Lockes notes are often abbreviated and are full of codes which he used to reference material across notebooks. Another way Locke personalized his notebooks was by devising his own method of creating indexes using a grid system and Latin keywords. Instead of recording entire words his indexes shortened words to their first letter and vowel. Thus the word Epistle would be classified as Ei. Locke published his method in French in 1686 and it was republished posthumously in English in 1706. Some of the books in Lockes library at the Bodleian are a combination of manuscript and print. Locke had some of his books interleaved meaning that they were bound with blank sheets in-between the printed pages to enable annotations. Locke interleaved and annotated his five volumes of the New Testament in French Greek and Latin . Locke did the same with his copy of Thomas Hydes Bodleian Library catalogue which Locke used to create a catalogue of his own library.
Jonathan Swift,Jonathan Swift was an Anglo-Irishsatirist author essayist political pamphleteer poet and Anglican cleric who became Dean of St Patricks Cathedral Dublin hence his common sobriquet Dean Swift. Swift is remembered for works such as A Tale of a Tub An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity Gullivers Travels and A Modest Proposal . He is regarded by the Encyclopædia Britannica as the foremost prose satirist in the English language. He originally published all of his works under pseudonymssuch as Lemuel Gulliver Isaac Bickerstaff M. B. Drapieror anonymously. He was a master of two styles of satire the Horatian and Juvenalian styles. His deadpan ironic writing style particularly in A Modest Proposal has led to such satire being subsequently termed Swiftian. Jonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in Dublin in the Kingdom of Ireland. He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift and his wife Abigail Erick of Frisby on the Wreake. His father was a native of Goodrich Herefordshire but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their Royalist fathers estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. His maternal grandfather James Ericke was the vicar of Thornton in Leicestershire. In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices. Some time thereafter Ericke and his family including his young daughter Abigail fled to Ireland. Swifts father joined his elder brother Godwin in the practice of law in Ireland. He died in Dublin about seven months before his namesake was born. He died of syphilis which he said he got from dirty sheets when out of town. His mother returned to England after his birth leaving him in the care of his uncle Godwin Swift a close friend and confidant of Sir John Temple whose son later employed Swift as his secretary. At the age of one child Jonathan was taken by his wet nurse to her hometown of Whitehaven Cumberland England. He said that there he learned to read the Bible. His nurse returned him to his mother still in Ireland when he was three. Swifts family had several interesting literary connections. His grandmother Elizabeth Swift was the niece of Sir Erasmus Dryden grandfather of poet John Dryden. The same grandmothers aunt Katherine Dryden was a first cousin of Elizabeth wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. His great-great-grandmother Margaret Swift was the sister of Francis Godwin author of The Man in the Moone which influenced parts of Swifts Gullivers Travels. His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir William Davenant a godson of William Shakespeare. Swifts benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift took primary responsibility for the young man sending him with one of his cousins to Kilkenny College . He arrived there at the age of six where he was expected to have already learned the basic declensions in Latin. He had not and thus began his schooling in a lower form. Swift graduated in 1682 when he was 15. He attended Trinity College Dublin in 1682 financed by Godwins son Willoughby. The four-year course followed a curriculum largely set in the Middle Ages for the priesthood. The lectures were dominated by Aristotelian logic and philosophy. The basic skill taught the students was debate and they were expected to be able to argue both sides of any argument or topic. Swift was an above-average student but not exceptional and received his B.A. in 1686 by special grace. Swift was studying for his masters degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the Glorious Revolution forced him to leave for England in 1688 where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir William Temple at Moor Park Farnham. Temple was an English diplomat who had arranged the Triple Alliance of 1668. He had retired from public service to his country estate to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employers confidence Swift was often trusted with matters of great importance. Within three years of their acquaintance Temple introduced his secretary to WilliamIII and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments. Swift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met Esther Johnson then eight years old the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temples sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor giving her the nickname Stella and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esthers life. In 1690 Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health but returned to Moor Park the following year. The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness now believed to be Ménières disease and it continued to plague him throughout his life. During this second stay with Temple Swift received his M.A. from Hart Hall Oxford in 1692. He then left Moor Park apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temples patronage in order to become an ordained priest in the Established Church of Ireland. He was appointed to the prebend of Kilroot in the Diocese of Connor in 1694 with his parish located at Kilroot near Carrickfergus in County Antrim. Swift appears to have been miserable in his new position being isolated in a small remote community far from the centres of power and influence. While at Kilroot however he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring whom he called Varina the sister of an old college friend. A letter from him survives offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused. She presumably refused because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temples service at Moor Park in 1696 and he remained there until Temples death. There he was employed in helping to prepare Temples memoirs and correspondence for publication. During this time Swift wrote The Battle of the Books a satire responding to critics of Temples Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning though Battle was not published until 1704. Temple died on 27 January 1699. Swift normally a harsh judge of human nature said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple. He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temples memoirs and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England. His work made enemies among some of Temples family and friends in particular Temples formidable sister Martha Lady Giffard who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs. Moreover she noted that Swift had borrowed from her own biography an accusation that Swift denied. Swifts next move was to approach King William directly based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position. This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. However when he reached Ireland he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another. He soon obtained the living of Laracor Agher and Rathbeggan and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patricks Cathedral Dublin. Swift ministered to a congregation of about 15 at Laracor which was just over four and a half miles from Summerhill County Meath and twenty miles from Dublin. He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage. As chaplain to Lord Berkeley he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years. In 1701 he anonymously published the political pamphlet A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome. Swift resided in Trim County Meath after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this time period. In February 1702 Swift received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Trinity College Dublin. That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October accompanied by Esther Johnsonnow 20and his friend Rebecca Dingley another member of William Temples household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swifts relationship with Esther Johnson nicknamed Stella. Many notably his close friend Thomas Sheridan believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others like Swifts housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley dismissed the story as absurd. Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else in 1704 when their mutual friend William Tisdall informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an interloper and they were estranged for many years. During his visits to England in these years Swift published A Tale of a Tub and The Battle of the Books and began to gain a reputation as a writer. This led to close lifelong friendships with Alexander Pope John Gay and John Arbuthnot forming the core of the Martinus Scriblerus Club . Swift became increasingly active politically in these years. Swift supported the Glorious Revolution and early in his life belonged to the Whigs. As a member of the Anglican Church he feared a return of the Catholic monarchy and Papist absolutism. From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710 Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of Lord Godolphin the claims of the Irish clergy to the First-Fruits and Twentieths which brought in about 2500 a year already granted to their brethren in England. He found the opposition Tory leadership more sympathetic to his cause and when they came to power in 1710 he was recruited to support their cause as editor of The Examiner. In 1711 Swift published the political pamphlet The Conduct of the Allies attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France. The incoming Tory government conducted secret negotiations with France resulting in the Treaty of Utrecht ending the War of the Spanish Succession. Swift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government and often acted as mediator between Henry St John the secretary of state for foreign affairs and Robert Harley lord treasurer and prime minister . Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson collected and published after his death as A Journal to Stella. The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714. With the death of Queen Anne and accession of George I that year the Whigs returned to power and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France. Swift has been described by scholars as a Whig in politics and Tory in religion and Swift related his own views in similar terms stating that as a lover of liberty I found myself to be what they called a Whig in politics... But as to religion I confessed myself to be an High-Churchman. In his Thoughts on Religion fearing the intense partisan strife waged over religious belief in seventeenth-century England Swift wrote that Every man as a member of the commonwealth ought to be content with the possession of his own opinion in private. However it should be borne in mind that during Swifts time period terms like Whig and Tory both encompassed a wide array of opinions and factions and neither term aligns with a modern political party or modern political alignments. Also during these years in London Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family and became involved with one of the daughters Esther. Swift furnished Esther with the nickname Vanessa and she features as one of the main characters in his poem Cadenus and Vanessa. The poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift and that he may have reciprocated her affections only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship. Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714 and settled at her old family home Celbridge Abbey. Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation possibly involving Esther Johnson. Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35 having destroyed the will she had made in Swifts favour. Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was Anne Long a toast of the Kit-Cat Club. Before the fall of the Tory government Swift hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England. However Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts. Her dislike has been attributed to A Tale of a Tub which she thought blasphemous compounded by The Windsor Prophecy where Swift with a surprising lack of tact advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust. The best position his friends could secure for him was the Deanery of St Patricks; this was not in the Queens gift and Anne who could be a bitter enemy made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it. With the return of the Whigs Swifts best move was to leave England and he returned to Ireland in disappointment a virtual exile to live like a rat in a hole. Once in Ireland however Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes producing some of his most memorable works Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture Drapiers Letters and A Modest Proposal earning him the status of an Irish patriot. This new role was unwelcome to the Government which made clumsy attempts to silence him. His printer Edward Waters was convicted of seditious libel in 1720 but four years later a grand jury refused to find that the Drapiers Letters were seditious. Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity his principal target being the vile and profligate villain William Whitshed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Also during these years he began writing his masterpiece Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World in Four Parts by Lemuel Gulliver first a surgeon and then a captain of several ships better known as Gullivers Travels. Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories illegal peace treaty; having done a good thing in an unfortunate manner. In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London taking with him the manuscript of Gullivers Travels. During his visit he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope John Arbuthnot and John Gay who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book. First published in November 1726 it was an immediate hit with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727. French German and Dutch translations appeared in 1727 and pirated copies were printed in Ireland. Swift returned to England one more time in 1727 and stayed once again with Alexander Pope. The visit was cut short when Swift received word that Esther Johnson was dying and rushed back home to be with her. On 28 January 1728 Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside even composing prayers for her comfort. Swift could not bear to be present at the end but on the night of her death he began to write his The Death of Mrs Johnson. He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patricks. Many years later a lock of hair assumed to be Johnsons was found in his desk wrapped in a paper bearing the words Only a womans hair. Death became a frequent feature of Swifts life from this point. In 1731 he wrote Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift his own obituary published in 1739. In 1732 his good friend and collaborator John Gay died. In 1735 John Arbuthnot another friend from his days in London died. In 1738 Swift began to show signs of illness and in 1742 he may have suffered a stroke losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled. He became increasingly quarrelsome and long-standing friendships like that with Thomas Sheridan ended without sufficient cause. To protect him from unscrupulous hangers-on who had begun to prey on the great man his closest companions had him declared of unsound mind and memory. However it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point. In his book Literature and Western Man author J. B. Priestley even cites the final chapters of Gullivers Travels as proof of Swifts approaching insanity. Bewley attributes his decline to terminal dementia. In part VIII of his series The Story of Civilization Will Durant describes the final years of Swifts life as such In 1744 Alexander Pope died. Then on 19 October 1745 Swift at nearly 78 died. After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnsons side in accordance with his wishes. The bulk of his fortune was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill originally known as St Patricks Hospital for Imbeciles which opened in 1757 and which still exists as a psychiatric hospital.

W. B. Yeats poetically translated it from the Latin as British politician Michael Foot was a great admirer of Swift and wrote about him extensively. In Debts of Honour he cites with approbation a theory propounded by Denis Johnston that offers an explanation of Swifts behavior towards Stella and Vanessa. Pointing to contradictions in the received information about Swifts origins and parentage Johnston postulates that Swifts real father was Sir William Temples father Sir John Temple who was Master of the Rolls in Dublin at the time. It is widely thought that Stella was Sir William Temples illegitimate daughter. So Swift was Sir Williams brother and Stellas uncle. Marriage or close relations between Swift and Stella would therefore have been incest an unthinkable prospect. It follows that Swift could not have married Vanessa either without Stella appearing to be a cast-off mistress which he would not contemplate. Johnstons theory is expounded fully in his book In Search of Swift. He is also cited in the Dictionary of Irish Biography and the theory is presented without attribution in the Concise Cambridge History of English Literature. Swift was a prolific writer. The collection of his prose works comprises fourteen volumes. A 1983 edition of his complete poetry is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence fills three volumes. Swifts first major prose work A Tale of a Tub demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work. It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets. In its main thread the Tale recounts the exploits of three sons representing the main threads of Christianity who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever. However the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion and begin to look for loopholes in their fathers will that will let them make the needed alterations. As each finds his own means of getting around their fathers admonition they struggle with each other for power and dominance. Inserted into this story in alternating chapters the narrator includes a series of whimsical digressions on various subjects. In 1690 Sir William Temple Swifts patron published An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning a defence of classical writing holding up the Epistles of Phalaris as an example. William Wotton responded to Temple with Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning showing that the Epistles were a later forgery. A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by Charles Boyle . A further retort on the Modern side came from Richard Bentley one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day in his essay Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris . The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his Battle of the Books in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients. In 1708 a cobbler named John Partridge published a popular almanac of astrological predictions. Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials Swift attacked Partridge in Predictions for the Ensuing Year by Isaac Bickerstaff a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March. Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died which was widely believed despite Partridges statements to the contrary. According to other sourcesRichard Steele used the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff and was the one who wrote about the death of John Partridge and published it in The Spectator not Jonathan Swift. The Drapiers Letters was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood to mint copper coinage for Ireland. It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit. In these letters Swift posed as a shopkeepera draperto criticise the plan. Swifts writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author. Though hardly a secret no one turned Swift in although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher John Harding. Thanks to the general outcry against the coinage Woods patent was rescinded in September 1725 and the coins were kept out of circulation. In Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements. Gullivers Travels a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois was published in 1726. It is regarded as his masterpiece. As with his other writings the Travels was published under a pseudonym the fictional Lemuel Gulliver a ships surgeon and later a sea captain. Some of the correspondence between printer Benj. Motte and Gullivers also-fictional cousin negotiating the books publication has survived. Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in bowdlerised form as a childrens book it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swifts experience of his times. Gullivers Travels is an anatomy of human nature a sardonic looking-glass often criticised for its apparent misanthropy. It asks its readers to refute it to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society. Each of the four booksrecounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic landshas a different theme but all are attempts to deflate human pride. Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought. In 1729 Swifts A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick was published in Dublin by Sarah Harding. It is a satire in which the narrator with intentionally grotesque arguments recommends that Irelands poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food... Following the satirical form he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients... taxing our absentees... using except what is of our own growth and manufacture... rejecting... foreign luxury... introducing a vein of parsimony prudence and temperance... learning to love our country... quitting our animosities and factions... teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants.... Therefore I repeat let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients till he hath at least some glympse of hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice. John Ruskin named him as one of the three people in history who were the most influential for him.George Orwell named him as one of the writers he most admired despite disagreeing with him on almost every moral and political issue.Modernist poet Edith Sitwell wrote a fictional biography of Swift titled I Live Under a Black Sun and published in 1937.A. L. Rowse wrote a biography of Swift essays on his works and edited the Pan Books edition of Gullivers Travels. Literary scholar Frank Stier Goodwin wrote a full biography of Swift Jonathan Swift Giant in Chains issued by Liveright Publishing Corporation New York . In 1982 Soviet playwright Grigory Gorin wrote a theatrical fantasy called The House That Swift Built based on the last years of Jonathan Swifts life and episodes of his works. The play was filmed by director Mark Zakharov in the 1984 two-part television movie of the same name.Jake Arnott features him in his 2017 novel The Fatal Tree. A 2017 analysis of library holdings data revealed that Swift is the most popular Irish author and that Gullivers Travels is the most widely held work of Irish literature in libraries globally. The first woman to write a biography of Swift was Sophie Shilleto Smith who published Dean Swift in 1910. Swift crater a crater on Marss moon Deimos is named after Jonathan Swift who predicted the existence of the moons of Mars. In honour of Swifts long-time residence in Trim there are several monuments in the town marking his legacy. Most notable is Swifts Street named after him. Trim also holds a recurring festival in honour of Swift called the Trim Swift Festival.
Alexander Pope,Alexander Pope was an English poet translator and satirist of the Enlightenment era who is considered one of the most prominent English poets of the early 18th century. An exponent of Augustan literature Pope is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry including The Rape of the Lock The Dunciad and An Essay on Criticism and for his translations of Homer. Pope is often quoted in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations some of his verses having entered common parlance . Alexander Pope was born in London on 21 May 1688 during the year of the Glorious Revolution. His father was a successful linen merchant in the Strand London. His mother Edith was the daughter of William Turner Esquire of York. Both parents were Catholics. His mothers sister Christiana was the wife of famous miniature painter Samuel Cooper. Popes education was affected by the recently enacted Test Acts a series of English penal laws that upheld the status of the established Church of England banning Catholics from teaching attending a university voting and holding public office on penalty of perpetual imprisonment. Pope was taught to read by his aunt and attended Twyford School circa 1698. He also attended two Roman Catholic schools in London. Such schools though still illegal were tolerated in some areas. In 1700 his family moved to a small estate at Popeswood in Binfield Berkshire close to the royal Windsor Forest. This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing Papists from living within 10 miles of London or Westminster. Pope would later describe the countryside around the house in his poem Windsor Forest. Popes formal education ended at this time and from then on he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the satirists Horace and Juvenal the epic poets Homer and Virgil as well as English authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer William Shakespeare and John Dryden. He studied many languages reading works by French Italian Latin and Greek poets. After five years of study Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as William Congreve Samuel Garth and William Trumbull. At Binfield he made many important friends. One of them John Caryll was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright William Wycherley and to William Walsh a minor poet who helped Pope revise his first major work The Pastorals. There he met the Blount sisters Teresa and Martha in 1707. He remained close friends with Patty until his death but his friendship with Teresa ended in 1722. From the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems including Pott disease a form of tuberculosis that affects the spine which deformed his body and stunted his growth leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties high fevers inflamed eyes and abdominal pain. He grew to a height of only 4feet 6inches . Pope was already removed from society as a Catholic and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters including Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. It has been alleged that his lifelong friend Martha Blount was his lover. His friend William Cheselden said according to Joseph Spence I could give a more particular account of Mr. Popes health than perhaps any man. Cibbers slander is false. He had been gay but left that way of life upon his acquaintance with Mrs. B. In May 1709 Popes Pastorals was published in the sixth part of bookseller Jacob Tonsons Poetical Miscellanies. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by An Essay on Criticism published in May 1711 which was equally well received. Around 1711 Pope made friends with Tory writers Jonathan Swift Thomas Parnell and John Arbuthnot who together formed the satirical Scriblerus Club. Its aim was to satirise ignorance and pedantry through the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with Whig writers Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. In March 1713 Windsor Forest was published to great acclaim. During Popes friendship with Joseph Addison he contributed to Addisons play Cato as well as writing for The Guardian and The Spectator. Around this time he began the work of translating the Iliad which was a painstaking process publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720. In 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the Hanoverians and the Jacobites leading to the Jacobite rising of 1715. Though Pope as a Catholic might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations according to Maynard Mack where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known. These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the Tories and Popes friend Henry St John 1st Viscount Bolingbroke fled to France. Pope lived in his parents house in Mawson Row Chiswick between 1716 and 1719; the red-brick building is now the Mawson Arms commemorating him with a blue plaque. The money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to a villa at Twickenham where he created his now-famous grotto and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked Were it to have nymphs as well it would be complete in everything. Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished much of the grotto survives beneath Radnor House Independent Co-educational School. The grotto has been restored and will open to the public for 30 weekends a year from 2023 under the auspices of Popes Grotto Preservation Trust. An Essay on Criticism was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it. At the time the poem was published its heroic couplet style was quite a new poetic form and Popes work an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. It was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past. The essay begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry by which a critic passes judgement. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while analysing poetry pointing out the important function critics perform in aiding poets with their works as opposed to simply attacking them. The final section of An Essay on Criticism discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in an ideal critic whom Pope claims is also the ideal man. Popes most famous poem is The Rape of the Lock first published in 1712 with a revised version in 1714. A mock-epic it satirises a high-society quarrel between Arabella Fermor and Lord Petre who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without permission. The satirical style is tempered however by a genuine almost voyeuristic interest in the beau-monde of 18th-century society. The revised extended version of the poem focuses more clearly on its true subject the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers. In the poem purchased artefacts displace human agency and trivial things come to dominate. Though The Dunciad first appeared anonymously in Dublin its authorship was not in doubt. Pope pilloried a host of other hacks scribblers and dunces in addition to Theobald and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication in many ways the greatest act of folly in Popes life. Though a masterpiece due to having become one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry writes Mack it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies. According to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett some of Popes targets were so enraged by The Dunciad that they threatened him physically. My brother does not seem to know what fear is she told Joseph Spence explaining that Pope loved to walk alone so went accompanied by his Great Dane Bounce and for some time carried pistols in his pocket. This first Dunciad along with John Gays The Beggars Opera and Jonathan Swifts Gullivers Travels joined in a concerted propaganda assault against Robert Walpoles Whig ministry and the financial revolution it stabilised. Although Pope was a keen participant in the stock and money markets he never missed a chance to satirise the personal social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From The Rape of the Lock onwards these satirical themes appear constantly in his work. In 1731 Pope published his Epistle to Burlington on the subject of architecture the first of four poems later grouped as the Moral Essays . The epistle ridicules the bad taste of the aristocrat Timon. For example the following are verses 99 and 100 of the Epistle At Timons Villa let us paſs a dayWhere all cry out What ſums are thrown away Popes foes claimed he was attacking the Duke of Chandos and his estate Cannons. Though the charge was untrue it did much damage to Pope. There has been some speculation on a feud between Pope and Thomas Hearne due in part to the character of Wormius in The Dunciad who is seemingly based on Hearne. An Essay on Man is a philosophical poem in heroic couplets published between 1732 and 1734. Pope meant it as the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece that he sought to make into a larger work but he did not live to complete it. Itattempts to vindicate the ways of God to Man a variation on Miltons attempt in Paradise Lost to justify the ways of God to Man . It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric worldview. The poem is not solely Christian however. It assumes that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation. Consisting of four epistles addressed to Lord Bolingbroke it presents an idea of Popes view of the Universe no matter how imperfect complex inscrutable and disturbing the Universe may be it functions in a rational fashion according to natural laws so that the Universe as a whole is a perfect work of God though to humans it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope ascribes this to our limited mindset and intellectual capacity. He argues that humans must accept their position in the Great Chain of Being at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. Accomplish this and we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives. The poem is an affirmative statement of faith life seems chaotic and confusing to man in the centre of it but according to Pope it is truly divinely ordered. In Popes world God exists and is what he centres the Universe around as an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and experience only partial truths hence man must rely on hope which then leads to faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it in terms of riches power and fame. Pope proclaims that mans duty is to strive to be good regardless of other situations. The Imitations of Horace that followed were written in the popular Augustan form of an imitation of a classical poet not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of Horace to satirise life under George II especially what he saw as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpoles influence and the poor quality of the courts artistic taste. Pope added as an introduction to Imitations a wholly original poem that reviews his own literary career and includes famous portraits of Lord Hervey Thomas Hay 9th Earl of Kinnoull and Addison . Among the younger poets whose work Pope admired was Joseph Thurston. After 1738 Pope himself wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called Brutus but only the opening lines survive. His major work in those years was to revise and expand his masterpiece The Dunciad. Book Four appeared in 1742 and a full revision of the whole poem the following year. Here Pope replaced the hero Lewis Theobald with the Poet Laureate Colley Cibber as king of dunces. However the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and his works. By now Popes health which had never been good was failing. When told by his physician on the morning of his death that he was better Pope replied Here am I dying of a hundred good symptoms. He died at his villa surrounded by friends on 30 May 1744 about eleven oclock at night. On the previous day 29 May 1744 Pope had called for a priest and received the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. He was buried in the nave of St Marys Church Twickenham. Pope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713 he announced plans to publish a translation of the Iliad. The work would be available by subscription with one volume appearing every year over six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot which earned him 200 guineas a volume a vast sum at the time. His Iliad translation appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by Samuel Johnson as a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal  Encouraged by the success of the Iliad Bernard Lintot published Popes five-volume translation of Homers Odyssey in 17251726. For this Pope collaborated with William Broome and Elijah Fenton Broome translated eight books Fenton four and Pope the remaining 12. Broome provided the annotations. Pope tried to conceal the extent of the collaboration but the secret leaked out. It did some damage to Popes reputation for a time but not to his profits.Leslie Stephen considered Popes portion of the Odyssey inferior to his version of the Iliad given that Pope had put more effort into the earlier work to which in any case his style was better suited. In this period Pope was employed by the publisher Jacob Tonson to produce an opulent new edition of Shakespeare. When it appeared in 1725 it silently regularised Shakespeares metre and rewrote his verse in several places. Pope also removed about 1560 lines of Shakespeares material arguing that some appealed to him more than others. In 1726 the lawyer poet and pantomime-deviser Lewis Theobald published a scathing pamphlet called Shakespeare Restored which catalogued the errors in Popes work and suggested several revisions to the text. This enraged Pope wherefore Theobald became the main target of Popes Dunciad. The second edition of Popes Shakespeare appeared in 1728. Apart from some minor revisions to the preface it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Popes creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Popes preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeares texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century. Popes poetic career testifies to an indomitable spirit despite disadvantages of health and circumstance. The poet and his family were Catholics and so fell subject to the prohibitive Test Acts which hampered their co-religionists after the abdication of James II. One of these banned them from living within ten miles of London another from attending public school or university. So except for a few spurious Catholic schools Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a book lover reading in French Italian Latin and Greek and discovering Homer at the age of six. In 1700 when only twelve years of age he wrote his poem Ode on Solitude. As a child Pope survived once being trampled by a cow but when he was 12 he began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine which restricted his growth so that he was only 4feet 6inches tall as an adult. He also suffered from crippling headaches. In the year 1709 Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of Pastorals his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the age of 23 he had written An Essay on Criticism released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of Horaces Ars Poetica it met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends notably Joseph Addison and Richard Steele who had recently begun to collaborate on the influential The Spectator. The critic John Dennis having found an ironic and veiled portrait of himself was outraged by what he saw as the impudence of a younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life and save for a temporary reconciliation dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print to which Pope retaliated in kind making Dennis the butt of much satire. A folio containing a collection of his poems appeared in 1717 along with two new ones about the passion of love Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady and the famous proto-romantic poem Eloisa to Abelard. Though Pope never married about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu whom he indirectly referenced in his popular Eloisa to Abelard and to Martha Blount with whom his friendship continued through his life. As a satirist Pope made his share of enemies as critics politicians and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharp-witted satires. Some were so virulent that Pope even carried pistols while walking his dog. In 1738 and thenceforth Pope composed relatively little. He began having ideas for a patriotic epic in blank verse titled Brutus but mainly revised and expanded his Dunciad. Book Four appeared in 1742; and a complete revision of the whole in the year that followed. At this time Lewis Theobald was replaced with the Poet Laureate Colley Cibber as king of dunces but his real target remained the Whig politician Robert Walpole. By the mid-18th century new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Popes death Joseph Warton claimed that Popes style was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent about his work. Though Lord Byron identified Pope as one of his chief influences believing his own scathing satire of contemporary English literature English Bards and Scotch Reviewers to be a continuance of Popes tradition William Wordsworth found Popes style too decadent to represent the human condition. George Gilfillan in an 1856 study called Popes talent a rose peering into the summer air fine rather than powerful. Popes reputation revived in the 20th century. His work was full of references to the people and places of his time which aided peoples understanding of the past. The post-war period stressed the power of Popes poetry recognising that Popes immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example Maynard Mack in the late 20th-century argued that Popes moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Popes poems appeared in ten volumes including an index volume.
Samuel Johnson,Samuel Johnson often called Dr Johnson was an English writer who made lasting contributions as a poet playwright essayist moralist literary critic sermonist biographer editor and lexicographer. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls him arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history. Born in Lichfield Staffordshire he attended Pembroke College Oxford until lack of funds forced him to leave. After working as a teacher he moved to London and began writing for The Gentlemans Magazine. Early works include Life of Mr Richard Savage the poems London and The Vanity of Human Wishes and the play Irene. After nine years effort Johnsons A Dictionary of the English Language appeared in 1755 and was acclaimed as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship. Later work included essays an annotated The Plays of William Shakespeare and the apologue The History of Rasselas Prince of Abissinia. In 1763 he befriended James Boswell with whom he travelled to Scotland as Johnson described in A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland. Near the end of his life came a massive influential Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets of the 17th and 18th centuries. Dr Johnson was a devout Anglican and a committed Tory. Tall and robust he displayed gestures and tics that disconcerted some on meeting him. Boswells Life of Samuel Johnson along with other biographies documented Johnsons behaviour and mannerisms in such detail that they have informed the posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome a condition not defined or diagnosed in the 18th century. After several illnesses he died on the evening of 13 December 1784 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. In his later life Johnson became a celebrity and following his death he was increasingly seen to have had a lasting effect on literary criticism even being claimed to be the one truly great critic of English literature. A prevailing mode of literary theory in the 20th century drew from his views and he had a lasting impact on biography. Johnsons Dictionary had far-reaching effects on Modern English and was pre-eminent until the arrival of the Oxford English Dictionary 150 years later. Boswells Life was selected by Johnson biographer Walter Jackson Bate as the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature. Samuel Johnson was born on 18 September 1709 to Sarah and Michael Johnson a bookseller. His mother was 40 when she gave birth to Johnson in the family home above his fathers bookshop in Lichfield Staffordshire. This was considered an unusually late pregnancy so precautions were taken and a man-midwife and surgeon of great reputation named George Hector was brought in to assist. The infant Johnson did not cry and there were concerns for his health. His aunt exclaimed that she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street. The family feared that Johnson would not survive and summoned the vicar of St Marys to perform a baptism. Two godfathers were chosen Samuel Swynfen a physician and graduate of Pembroke College Oxford and Richard Wakefield a lawyer coroner and Lichfield town clerk. Johnsons health improved and he was put to wet-nurse with Joan Marklew. Some time later he contracted scrofula known at the time as the Kings Evil because it was thought royalty could cure it. Sir John Floyer former physician to King Charles II recommended that the young Johnson should receive the royal touch and he did so from Queen Anne on 30 March 1712. However the ritual proved ineffective and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scars across his face and body. Queen Anne gave Johnson an amulet on a chain he would wear the rest of his life. When Johnson was three Nathaniel was born. According to Nathaniel in a letter he wrote to Sarah complained Johnson would scarcely ever use me with common civility. With the birth of Johnsons brother their father was unable to pay the debts he had accrued over the years and the family was no longer able to maintain its standard of living. When he was a child in petticoats and had learnt to read Mrs. Johnsonone morning put the common prayer-book into his hands pointed to the collect for the day and said Sam you must get this by heart. She went up stairs leaving him to study it But by the time she had reached the second floor she heard him following her. Whats the matter said she. I can say it he replied; and repeated it distinctly though he could not have read it more than twice. Johnson displayed signs of great intelligence as a child and his parents to his later disgust would show off his newly acquired accomplishments. His education began at the age of three and was provided by his mother who had him memorise and recite passages from the Book of Common Prayer. When Samuel turned four he was sent to a nearby school and at the age of six he was sent to a retired shoemaker to continue his education. A year later Johnson went to Lichfield Grammar School where he excelled in Latin. For his most personal poems Johnson used Latin. During this time Johnson started to exhibit the tics that would influence how people viewed him in his later years and which formed the basis for a posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. He excelled at his studies and was promoted to the upper school at the age of nine. During this time he befriended Edmund Hector nephew of his man-midwife George Hector and John Taylor with whom he remained in contact for the rest of his life. At the age of 16 Johnson stayed with his cousins the Fords at Pedmore Worcestershire. There he became a close friend of Cornelius Ford who employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school. Ford was a successful well-connected academic and notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years later. After spending six months with his cousins Johnson returned to Lichfield but Hunter the headmaster angered by the impertinence of this long absence refused to allow Johnson to continue at the school. Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School Johnson enrolled at the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. As the school was located near Pedmore Johnson was able to spend more time with the Fords and he began to write poems and verse translations. However he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents home in Lichfield. During this time Johnsons future remained uncertain because his father was deeply in debt. To earn money Johnson began to stitch books for his father and it is likely that Johnson spent much time in his fathers bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until his mothers cousin Elizabeth Harriotts died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728 a few weeks after he turned 19 Johnson entered Pembroke College Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke and Andrew Corbet a friend and fellow student at the college offered to make up the deficit. Johnson made friends at Pembroke and read much. His tutor asked him to produce a Latin translation of Alexander Popes Messiah as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise it did not bring the material benefit he had hoped for. The poem later appeared in Miscellany of Poems edited by John Husbands a Pembroke tutor and is the earliest surviving publication of any of Johnsons writings. Johnson spent the rest of his time studying even during the Christmas holiday. He drafted a plan of study called Adversaria which he left unfinished and used his time to learn French while working on his Greek. Johnsons tutor Jorden left Pembroke some months after Johnsons arrival and was replaced by William Adams. Johnson enjoyed Adamss tutoring but by December was already a quarter behind in his student fees and was forced to return to Lichfield without a degree having spent 13 months at Oxford. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could not afford to transport them and also because he hoped to return. He eventually did receive a degree. Just before the publication of his Dictionary in 1755 the University of Oxford awarded Johnson the degree of Master of Arts. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1765 by Trinity College Dublin and in 1775 by the University of Oxford. In 1776 he returned to Pembroke with Boswell and toured the college with his former tutor Adams who by then was the Master of the college. During that visit he recalled his time at the college and his early career and expressed his later fondness for Jorden. Little is known about Johnsons life between the end of 1729 and 1731. It is likely that he lived with his parents. He experienced bouts of mental anguish and physical pain during years of illness; his tics and gesticulations associated with Tourette syndrome became more noticeable and were often commented upon. By 1731 Johnsons father was deeply in debt and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. Johnson hoped to get an ushers position which became available at Stourbridge Grammar School but since he did not have a degree his application was passed over on 6 September 1731. At about this time Johnsons father became ill and developed an inflammatory fever which led to his death in December 1731 when Johnson was twenty-two. Devastated by his fathers death Johnson sought to atone for an occasion he did not go with his father to sell books. Johnson stood for a considerable time bareheaded in the rain in the spot his fathers stall used to be. After the publication of Boswells Life of Samuel Johnson a statue was erected in that spot. Johnson eventually found employment as undermaster at a school in Market Bosworth run by Sir Wolstan Dixie who allowed Johnson to teach without a degree. Johnson was treated as a servant and considered teaching boring but nonetheless found pleasure in it. After an argument with Dixie he left the school and by June 1732 he had returned home. Johnson continued to look for a position at a Lichfield school. After being turned down for a job at Ashbourne School he spent time with his friend Edmund Hector who was living in the home of the publisher Thomas Warren. At the time Warren was starting his Birmingham Journal and he enlisted Johnsons help. This connection with Warren grew and Johnson proposed a translation of Jerónimo Lobos account of the Abyssinians. Johnson read Abbé Joachim Le Grands French translations and thought that a shorter version might be useful and profitable. Instead of writing the work himself he dictated to Hector who then took the copy to the printer and made any corrections. Johnsons A Voyage to Abyssinia was published a year later. He returned to Lichfield in February 1734 and began an annotated edition of Polizianos Latin poems along with a history of Latin poetry from Petrarch to Poliziano; a Proposal was soon printed but a lack of funds halted the project. Johnson remained with his close friend Harry Porter during a terminal illness which ended in Porters death on 3 September 1734. Porters wife Elizabeth was now a widow at the age of 45 with three children. Some months later Johnson began to court her. William Shaw a friend and biographer of Johnson claims that the first advances probably proceeded from her as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations Johnson was inexperienced in such relationships but the well-to-do widow encouraged him and promised to provide for him with her substantial savings. They married on 9 July 1735 at St Werburghs Church in Derby. The Porter family did not approve of the match partly because of the difference in their ages Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 46. Elizabeths marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he severed all relations with her. However her daughter Lucy accepted Johnson from the start and her other son Joseph later came to accept the marriage. In June 1735 while working as a tutor for the children of Thomas Whitby a local Staffordshire gentleman Johnson had applied for the position of headmaster at Solihull School. Although Johnsons friend Gilbert Walmisley gave his support Johnson was passed over because the schools directors thought he was a very haughty ill-natured gent and that he has such a way of distorting his face the gents think it may affect some lads. With Walmisleys encouragement Johnson decided that he could be a successful teacher if he ran his own school. In the autumn of 1735 Johnson opened Edial Hall School as a private academy at Edial near Lichfield. He had only three pupils Lawrence Offley George Garrick and the 18-year-old David Garrick who later became one of the most famous actors of his day. The venture was unsuccessful and cost Tetty a substantial portion of her fortune. Instead of trying to keep the failing school going Johnson began to write his first major work the historical tragedy Irene. Biographer Robert DeMaria believed that Tourette syndrome likely made public occupations like schoolmaster or tutor almost impossible for Johnson. This may have led Johnson to the invisible occupation of authorship. Johnson left for London with his former pupil David Garrick on 2 March 1737 the day Johnsons brother died. He was penniless and pessimistic about their travel but fortunately for them Garrick had connections in London and the two were able to stay with his distant relative Richard Norris. Johnson soon moved to Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. On 12 July 1737 he wrote to Edward Cave with a proposal for a translation of Paolo Sarpis The History of the Council of Trent which Cave did not accept until months later. In October 1737 Johnson brought his wife to London and he found employment with Cave as a writer for The Gentlemans Magazine. His assignments for the magazine and other publishers during this time were almost unparalleled in range and variety and so numerous so varied and scattered that Johnson himself could not make a complete list. In May 1738 his first major work the poem London was published anonymously. Based on Juvenals Satire III it describes the character Thales leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London which is portrayed as a place of crime corruption and poverty. Johnson could not bring himself to regard the poem as earning him any merit as a poet. Alexander Pope said that the author will soon be déterré but this would not happen until 15 years later. In August Johnsons lack of an MA degree from Oxford or Cambridge led to his being denied a position as master of the Appleby Grammar School. In an effort to end such rejections Pope asked Lord Gower to use his influence to have a degree awarded to Johnson. Gower petitioned Oxford for an honorary degree to be awarded to Johnson but was told that it was too much to be asked. Gower then asked a friend of Jonathan Swift to plead with Swift to use his influence at Trinity College Dublin to have a masters degree awarded to Johnson in the hope that this could then be used to justify an MA from Oxford but Swift refused to act on Johnsons behalf. Between 1737 and 1739 Johnson befriended poet Richard Savage. Feeling guilty of living almost entirely on Tettys money Johnson stopped living with her and spent his time with Savage. They were poor and would stay in taverns or sleep in night-cellars. Some nights they would roam the streets until dawn because they had no money. During this period Johnson and Savage worked as Grub Street writers who anonymously supplied publishers with on-demand material. In his Dictionary Johnson defined grub street as the name of a street in Moorfields in London much inhabited by writers of small histories dictionaries and temporary poems whence any mean production is called grubstreet. Savages friends tried to help him by attempting to persuade him to move to Wales but Savage ended up in Bristol and again fell into debt. He was committed to debtors prison and died in 1743. A year later Johnson wrote Life of Mr Richard Savage a moving work which in the words of the biographer and critic Walter Jackson Bate remains one of the innovative works in the history of biography. In 1746 a group of publishers approached Johnson with the idea of creating an authoritative dictionary of the English language. A contract with William Strahan and associates worth 1500 guineas was signed on the morning of 18 June 1746. Johnson claimed that he could finish the project in three years. In comparison the Académie Française had 40 scholars spending 40 years to complete their dictionary which prompted Johnson to claim This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman. Although he did not succeed in completing the work in three years he did manage to finish it in eight. Some criticised the dictionary including the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay who described Johnson as a wretched etymologist but according to Bate the Dictionary easily ranks as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship and probably the greatest ever performed by one individual who laboured under anything like the disadvantages in a comparable length of time. Johnsons constant work on the Dictionary disrupted his and Tettys living conditions. He had to employ a number of assistants for the copying and mechanical work which filled the house with incessant noise and clutter. He was always busy and kept hundreds of books around him.John Hawkins described the scene The books he used for this purpose were what he had in his own collection a copious but a miserably ragged one and all such as he could borrow; which latter if ever they came back to those that lent them were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning. Johnsons process included underlining words in the numerous books he wanted to include in his Dictionary. The assistants would copy out the underlined sentences on individual paper slips which would later be alphabetized and accompanied with examples. Johnson was also distracted by Tettys poor health as she began to show signs of a terminal illness. To accommodate both his wife and his work he moved to 17 Gough Square near his printer William Strahan. In preparation Johnson had written a Plan for the Dictionary. Philip Stanhope 4th Earl of Chesterfield was the patron of the Plan to Johnsons displeasure. Seven years after first meeting Johnson to go over the work Chesterfield wrote two anonymous essays in The World recommending the Dictionary. He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary. Johnson did not like the tone of the essays and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the works patron. In a letter to Chesterfield Johnson expressed this view and harshly criticised Chesterfield saying Is not a patron my lord one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water and when he has reached ground encumbers him with help The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours had it been early had been kind but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary and cannot impart it; till I am known and do not want it. Chesterfield impressed by the language kept the letter displayed on a table for anyone to read. The Dictionary was finally published in April 1755 with the title page noting that the University of Oxford had awarded Johnson a Master of Arts degree in anticipation of the work. The dictionary as published was a large book. Its pages were nearly 18 inches tall and the book was 20 inches wide when opened; it contained 42773 entries to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions and it sold for the extravagant price of 4 10s perhaps the rough equivalent of 350 today. An important innovation in English lexicography was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation of which there were approximately 114000. The authors most frequently cited include William Shakespeare John Milton and John Dryden. It was years before Johnsons Dictionary as it came to be known turned a profit. Authors royalties were unknown at the time and Johnson once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled received no further money from its sale. Years later many of its quotations would be repeated by various editions of the Websters Dictionary and the New English Dictionary. Johnsons dictionary was not the first nor was it unique. Other dictionaries such as Nathan Baileys Dictionarium Britannicum included more words and in the 150 years preceding Johnsons dictionary about twenty other general-purpose monolingual English dictionaries had been produced. However there was open dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period. In 1741 David Hume claimed The Elegance and Propriety of Stile have been very much neglected among us. We have no Dictionary of our Language and scarce a tolerable Grammar. Johnsons Dictionary offers insights into the 18th century and a faithful record of the language people used. It is more than a reference book; it is a work of literature. It was the most commonly used and imitated for the 150 years between its first publication and the completion of the Oxford English Dictionary in 1928. Johnson also wrote numerous essays sermons and poems during his years working on the dictionary. In 1750 he decided to produce a series of essays under the title The Rambler that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. During this time Johnson published no fewer than 208 essays each around 12001500 words long. Explaining the title years later he told his friend and portraitist Joshua Reynolds I was at a loss how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best that occurred and I took it. These essays often on moral and religious topics tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in The Rambler were to ask that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me but that I may promote thy glory and the salvation of myself and others. The popularity of The Rambler took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnsons life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson enjoying the essays greatly questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnsons friends were told of Johnsons authorship. One friend the novelist Charlotte Lennox includes a defence of The Rambler in her novel The Female Quixote . In particular the character Mr. Glanville says you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young a Richardson or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and for the want of Faults turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule. Later the novel describes Johnson as the greatest Genius in the present Age. His necessary attendance while his play was in rehearsal and during its performance brought him acquainted with many of the performers of both sexes which produced a more favourable opinion of their profession than he had harshly expressed in his Life of Savage. With some of them he kept up an acquaintance as long as he and they lived and was ever ready to shew them acts of kindness. He for a considerable time used to frequent the Green Room and seemed to take delight in dissipating his gloom by mixing in the sprightly chit-chat of the motley circle then to be found there. Mr. David Hume related to me from Mr. Garrick that Johnson at last denied himself this amusement from considerations of rigid virtue; saying Ill come no more behind your scenes David; for the silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my amorous propensities. Not all of his work was confined to The Rambler. His most highly regarded poem The Vanity of Human Wishes was written with such extraordinary speed that Boswell claimed Johnson might have been perpetually a poet. The poem is an imitation of Juvenals Satire X and claims that the antidote to vain human wishes is non-vain spiritual wishes. In particular Johnson emphasises the helpless vulnerability of the individual before the social context and the inevitable self-deception by which human beings are led astray. The poem was critically celebrated but it failed to become popular and sold fewer copies than London. In 1749 Garrick made good on his promise that he would produce Irene but its title was altered to Mahomet and Irene to make it fit for the stage.Irene which was written in blank verse was received rather poorly with a friend of Boswells commenting the play to be as frigid as the regions of Nova Zembla now and then you felt a little heat like what is produced by touching ice. The show eventually ran for nine nights. Tetty Johnson was ill during most of her time in London and in 1752 she decided to return to the countryside while Johnson was busy working on his Dictionary. She died on 17 March 1752 and at word of her death Johnson wrote a letter to his old friend Taylor which according to Taylor expressed grief in the strongest manner he had ever read. Johnson wrote a sermon in her honour to be read at her funeral but Taylor refused to read it for reasons which are unknown. This only exacerbated Johnsons feelings of loss and despair. Consequently John Hawkesworth had to organise the funeral. Johnson felt guilty about the poverty in which he believed he had forced Tetty to live and blamed himself for neglecting her. He became outwardly discontented and his diary was filled with prayers and laments over her death which continued until his own. She was his primary motivation and her death hindered his ability to complete his work. On 16 March 1756 Johnson was arrested for an outstanding debt of 5 18s. Unable to contact anyone else he wrote to the writer and publisher Samuel Richardson. Richardson who had previously lent Johnson money sent him six guineas to show his good will and the two became friends. Soon after Johnson met and befriended the painter Joshua Reynolds who so impressed Johnson that he declared him almost the only man whom I call a friend. Reynoldss younger sister Frances observed during their time together that men women and children gathered around him laughing at his gestures and gesticulations. In addition to Reynolds Johnson was close to Bennet Langton and Arthur Murphy. Langton was a scholar and an admirer of Johnson who persuaded his way into a meeting with Johnson which led to a long friendship. Johnson met Murphy during the summer of 1754 after Murphy came to Johnson about the accidental republishing of the Rambler No. 190 and the two became friends. Around this time Anna Williams began boarding with Johnson. She was a minor poet who was poor and becoming blind two conditions that Johnson attempted to change by providing room for her and paying for a failed cataract surgery. Williams in turn became Johnsons housekeeper. To occupy himself Johnson began to work on The Literary Magazine or Universal Review the first issue of which was printed on 19 March 1756. Philosophical disagreements erupted over the purpose of the publication when the Seven Years War began and Johnson started to write polemical essays attacking the war. After the war began the Magazine included many reviews at least 34 of which were written by Johnson. When not working on the Magazine Johnson wrote a series of prefaces for other writers such as Giuseppe Baretti William Payne and Charlotte Lennox. Johnsons relationship with Lennox and her works was particularly close during these years and she in turn relied so heavily upon Johnson that he was the most important single fact in Mrs Lennoxs literary life. He later attempted to produce a new edition of her works but even with his support they were unable to find enough interest to follow through with its publication. To help with domestic duties while Johnson was busy with his various projects Richard Bathurst a physician and a member of Johnsons Club pressured him to take on a freed slave Francis Barber as his servant. Johnsons work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took up most of his time. On 8 June 1756 Johnson published his Proposals for Printing by Subscription the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly and needed to be corrected. Johnsons progress on the work slowed as the months passed and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen he was arrested again for a debt of 40 in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson who had contracted Johnson to publish Shakespeare and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project. In 1758 Johnson began to write a weekly series The Idler which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760 as a way to avoid finishing his Shakespeare. This series was shorter and lacked many features of The Rambler. Unlike his independent publication of The Rambler The Idler was published in a weekly news journal The Universal Chronicle a publication supported by John Payne John Newbery Robert Stevens and William Faden. Since The Idler did not occupy all Johnsons time he was able to publish his philosophical novella Rasselas on 19 April 1759. The little story book as Johnson described it describes the life of Prince Rasselas and Nekayah his sister who are kept in a place called the Happy Valley in the land of Abyssinia. The Valley is a place free of problems where any desire is quickly satisfied. The constant pleasure does not however lead to satisfaction; and with the help of a philosopher named Imlac Rasselas escapes and explores the world to witness how all aspects of society and life in the outside world are filled with suffering. They return to Abyssinia but do not wish to return to the state of constantly fulfilled pleasures found in the Happy Valley.Rasselas was written in one week to pay for his mothers funeral and settle her debts; it became so popular that there was a new English edition of the work almost every year. References to it appear in many later works of fiction including Jane Eyre Cranford and The House of the Seven Gables. Its fame was not limited to English-speaking nations Rasselas was immediately translated into five languages and later into nine others. By 1762 however Johnson had gained notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the contemporary poet Churchill teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare He for subscribers baits his hook and takes your cash but wheres the book The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare and after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762 he was able to dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of 300 in appreciation for the Dictionary. While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials he was told by Bute that the pension is not given you for anything you are to do but for what you have done. On 16 May 1763 Johnson first met 22-year-old James Boswellwho would later become Johnsons first major biographerin the bookshop of Johnsons friend Tom Davies. They quickly became friends although Boswell would return to his home in Scotland or travel abroad for months at a time. Around the spring of 1763 Johnson formed The Club a social group that included his friends Reynolds Burke Garrick Goldsmith and others . They decided to meet every Monday at 700pm at the Turks Head in Gerrard Street Soho and these meetings continued until long after the deaths of the original members. On 9 January 1765 Murphy introduced Johnson to Henry Thrale a wealthy brewer and MP and his wife Hester. They struck up an instant friendship; Johnson was treated as a member of the family and was once more motivated to continue working on his Shakespeare. Afterwards Johnson stayed with the Thrales for 17 years until Henrys death in 1781 sometimes staying in rooms at Thrales Anchor Brewery in Southwark. Hester Thrales documentation of Johnsons life during this time in her correspondence and her diary became an important source of biographical information on Johnson after his death. During the whole of the interview Johnson talked to his Majesty with profound respect but still in his firm manly manner with a sonorous voice and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew Johnson shewed himself highly pleased with his Majestys conversation and gracious behaviour. He said to Mr Barnard Sir they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen. Johnsons edition of Shakespeare was finally published on 10 October 1765 as The Plays of William Shakespeare in Eight Volumes... To which are added Notes by Sam. Johnson in a printing of one thousand copies. The first edition quickly sold out and a second was soon printed. The plays themselves were in a version that Johnson felt was closest to the original based on his analysis of the manuscript editions. Johnsons revolutionary innovation was to create a set of corresponding notes that allowed readers to clarify the meaning behind many of Shakespeares more complicated passages and to examine those which had been transcribed incorrectly in previous editions. Included within the notes are occasional attacks upon rival editors of Shakespeares works. Years later Edmond Malone an important Shakespearean scholar and friend of Johnsons stated that Johnsons vigorous and comprehensive understanding threw more light on his authour than all his predecessors had done. On 6 August 1773 eleven years after first meeting Boswell Johnson set out to visit his friend in Scotland and to begin a journey to the western islands of Scotland as Johnsons 1775 account of their travels would put it. That account was intended to discuss the social problems and struggles that affected the Scottish people but it also praised many of the unique facets of Scottish society such as a school in Edinburgh for the deaf and mute. Also Johnson used the work to enter into the dispute over the authenticity of James Macphersons Ossian poems claiming they could not have been translations of ancient Scottish literature on the grounds that in those times nothing had been written in the Earse language. There were heated exchanges between the two and according to one of Johnsons letters MacPherson threatened physical violence. Boswells account of their journey The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides was a preliminary step toward his later biography The Life of Samuel Johnson. Included were various quotations and descriptions of events including anecdotes such as Johnson swinging a broadsword while wearing Scottish garb or dancing a Highland jig. In the 1770s Johnson who had tended to be an opponent of the government early in life published a series of pamphlets in favour of various government policies. In 1770 he produced The False Alarm a political pamphlet attacking John Wilkes. In 1771 his Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falklands Islands cautioned against war with Spain. In 1774 he printed The Patriot a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775 he made the famous statement Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. This line was not as widely believed about patriotism in general but what Johnson considered to be the false use of the term patriotism by Wilkes and his supporters. Johnson opposed self-professed Patriots in general but valued what he considered true patriotism. The last of these pamphlets Taxation No Tyranny was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a response to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America colonists had voluntarily resigned the power of voting but they still retained virtual representation in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish and asked How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament said Johnson they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as traitors to this country and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed but he felt confident that it would end with English superiority and American obedience. Years before Johnson had stated that the French and Indian War was a conflict between two robbers of Native American lands and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Treaty of Paris marking the colonists victory over the British Johnson became deeply disturbed with the state of this kingdom. Mr Thrales death was a very essential loss to Johnson who although he did not foresee all that afterwards happened was sufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr Thrales family afforded him would now in great measure cease. On 3 May 1777 while Johnson was trying and failing to save Reverend William Dodd from execution for forgery he wrote to Boswell that he was busy preparing a little Lives and little Prefaces to a little edition of the English Poets. Tom Davies William Strahan and Thomas Cadell had asked Johnson to create this final major work the Lives of the English Poets for which he asked 200 guineas an amount significantly less than the price he could have demanded. The Lives which were critical as well as biographical studies appeared as prefaces to selections of each poets work and they were longer and more detailed than originally expected. The work was finished in March 1781 and the whole collection was published in six volumes. As Johnson justified in the advertisement for the work my purpose was only to have allotted to every Poet an Advertisement like those which we find in the French Miscellanies containing a few dates and a general character. Johnson was unable to enjoy this success because Henry Thrale the dear friend with whom he lived died on 4 April 1781. Life changed quickly for Johnson when Hester Thrale became romantically involved with the Italian singing teacher Gabriel Mario Piozzi which forced Johnson to change his previous lifestyle. After returning home and then travelling for a short period Johnson received word that his friend and tenant Robert Levet had died on 17 January 1782. Johnson was shocked by the death of Levet who had resided at Johnsons London home since 1762. Shortly afterwards Johnson caught a cold that developed into bronchitis and lasted for several months. His health was further complicated by feeling forlorn and lonely over Levets death and by the deaths of his friend Thomas Lawrence and his housekeeper Williams. Although he had recovered his health by August Johnson experienced emotional trauma when he was given word that Hester Thrale would sell the residence that Johnson shared with the family. What hurt Johnson most was the possibility that he would be left without her constant company. Months later on 6 October 1782 Johnson attended church for the final time in his life to say goodbye to his former residence and life. The walk to the church strained him but he managed the journey unaccompanied. While there he wrote a prayer for the Thrale family To thy fatherly protection O Lord I commend this family. Bless guide and defend them that they may pass through this world as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness for Jesus Christs sake. Amen. Hester Thrale did not completely abandon Johnson and asked him to accompany the family on a trip to Brighton. He agreed and was with them from 7 October to 20 November 1782. On his return his health began to fail and he was left alone after Boswells visit on 29 May 1783. On 17 June 1783 Johnsons poor circulation resulted in a stroke and he wrote to his neighbour Edmund Allen that he had lost the ability to speak. Two doctors were brought in to aid Johnson; he regained his ability to speak two days later. Johnson feared that he was dying and wrote The black dog I hope always to resist and in time to drive though I am deprived of almost all those that used to help me. The neighbourhood is impoverished. I had once Richardson and Lawrence in my reach. Mrs. Allen is dead. My house has lost Levet a man who took interest in everything and therefore ready at conversation. Mrs. Williams is so weak that she can be a companion no longer. When I rise my breakfast is solitary the black dog waits to share it from breakfast to dinner he continues barking except that Dr. Brocklesby for a little keeps him at a distance. Dinner with a sick woman you may venture to suppose not much better than solitary. After dinner what remains but to count the clock and hope for that sleep which I can scarce expect. Night comes at last and some hours of restlessness and confusion bring me again to a day of solitude. What shall exclude the black dog from an habitation like this By this time he was sick and gout-ridden. He had surgery for gout and his remaining friends including novelist Fanny Burney came to keep him company. He was confined to his room from 14 December 1783 to 21 April 1784. A few days before his death he had asked Sir John Hawkins one of his executors where he should be buried; and on being answered Doubtless in Westminster Abbey seemed to feel a satisfaction very natural to a Poet. His health began to improve by May 1784 and he travelled to Oxford with Boswell on 5 May 1784. By July many of Johnsons friends were either dead or gone; Boswell had left for Scotland and Hester Thrale had become engaged to Piozzi. With no one to visit Johnson expressed a desire to die in London and arrived there on 16 November 1784. On 25 November 1784 he allowed Burney to visit him and expressed an interest to her that he should leave London; he soon left for Islington to George Strahans home. His final moments were filled with mental anguish and delusions; when his physician Thomas Warren visited and asked him if he were feeling better Johnson burst out with No Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death. Many visitors came to see Johnson as he lay sick in bed but he preferred only Langtons company. Burney waited for word of Johnsons condition along with Windham Strahan Hoole Cruikshank Des Moulins and Barber. On 13 December 1784 Johnson met with two others a young woman Miss Morris whom Johnson blessed and Francesco Sastres an Italian teacher who was given some of Johnsons final words Iam Moriturus . Shortly afterwards he fell into a coma and died at 700p.m. Langton waited until 1100p.m. to tell the others which led to John Hawkins becoming pale and overcome with an agony of mind along with Seward and Hoole describing Johnsons death as the most awful sight. Boswell remarked My feeling was just one large expanse of Stupor... I could not believe it. My imagination was not convinced.William Gerard Hamilton joined in and stated He has made a chasm which not only nothing can fill up but which nothing has a tendency to fill up. Johnson is dead. Let us go to the next best There is nobody; no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson. He was buried on 20 December 1784 at Westminster Abbey with an inscription that reads Johnsons works especially his Lives of the Poets series describe various features of excellent writing. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language and he disliked the use of decorative or purposely archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Miltons Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery. In his smaller poetic works Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy which possibly influenced Housmans poetic style. In London his first imitation of Juvenal Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However his second imitation The Vanity of Human Wishes is completely different; the language remains simple but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem but contain views expressed in most of Johnsons works. In particular Johnson emphasises Gods infinite love and argues that happiness can be attained through virtuous action. When it came to biography Johnson disagreed with Plutarchs use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals too were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries including his own as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he writes that a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life. Johnsons thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism or elegance of style. Although a smaller edition became the household standard Johnsons original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose Johnson included quotations from Bacon Hooker Milton Shakespeare Spenser and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields natural science philosophy poetry and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context. Johnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeares plays Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers it is to be imputed to the nature of his work which required the use of common colloquial language and consequently admitted many phrases allusive elliptical and proverbial such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them. His works on Shakespeare were devoted not merely to Shakespeare but to understanding literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeares faults including what he saw as lack of morality vulgarity carelessness in crafting plots and occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeares plays in particular had multiple editions each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way. Johnsons tall and robust figure combined with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when William Hogarth first saw Johnson standing near a window in Richardsons house shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner Hogarth thought Johnson an ideot whom his relations had put under the care of Mr. Richardson. Hogarth was quite surprised when this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument... such a power of eloquence that Hogarth looked at him with astonishment and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired. Beyond appearance Adam Smith claimed that Johnson knew more books than any man alive while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament he certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there. Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric and he is well known for his refutation of Bishop Berkeleys immaterialism his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist during a conversation with Boswell Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeleys theory I refute it thus Johnson was a devout conservative Anglican and a compassionate man who supported a number of poor friends under his own roof even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnsons Christian morality permeated his works and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that Walter Jackson Bate claims no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him. However as Donald Greene points out Johnsons moral writings do not contain a predetermined and authorized pattern of good behavior even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christian beliefs. Although Johnson respected Miltons poetry he could not tolerate Miltons Puritan and Republican beliefs feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds and once proposed a toast to the next rebellion of the Negroes in the West Indies. Beside his beliefs concerning humanity Johnson is also known for his love of cats especially his own two cats Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge his cat. After we came out of the church we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeleys ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone till he rebounded from it I refute it thus. Johnson was also known as a staunch Tory; he admitted to sympathies for the Jacobite cause during his younger years but by the reign of George III he came to accept the Hanoverian Succession. It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an arch-conservative and it was Boswell more than anyone else who determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later. However Boswell was not around for two of Johnsons most politically active periods during Walpoles control over British Parliament and during the Seven Years War. Although Boswell was present with Johnson during the 1770s and describes four major pamphlets written by Johnson he neglects to discuss them because he is more interested in their travels to Scotland. This is compounded by the fact that Boswell held an opinion contrary to two of these pamphlets The False Alarm and Taxation No Tyranny and so attacks Johnsons views in his biography. In his Life of Samuel Johnson Boswell referred to Johnson as Dr. Johnson so often that he would always be known as such even though he hated being called such. Boswells emphasis on Johnsons later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers. Although Boswell a Scotsman was his close companion and friend Johnson like many of his fellow Englishmen had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland Johnson exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism. Hester Thrale in summarising Johnsons nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice said We all know how well he loved to abuse the Scotch indeed to be abused by them in return. Johnson had several health problems including childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring deafness in one ear and blindness in one eye gout testicular cancer and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses including depression and Tourette syndrome. There are many accounts of Johnson suffering from bouts of depression and what Johnson thought might be madness. As Walter Jackson Bate puts it one of the ironies of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common senseof the strong imaginative grasp of concrete realityshould have begun his adult life at the age of twenty in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that at least from his own point of view it seemed the onset of actual insanity. To overcome these feelings Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson at one time strongly entertained thoughts of suicide. Boswell claimed that Johnson felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia with perpetual irritation fretfulness and impatience; and with a dejection gloom and despair which made existence misery. Early on when Johnson was unable to pay off his debts he began to work with professional writers and identified his own situation with theirs. During this time Johnson witnessed Christopher Smarts decline into penury and the madhouse and feared that he might share the same fate. Hester Thrale Piozzi claimed in a discussion on Smarts mental state that Johnson was her friend who feared an apple should intoxicate him. To her what separated Johnson from others who were placed in asylums for madnesslike Christopher Smartwas his ability to keep his concerns and emotions to himself. Two hundred years after Johnsons death the posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnsons lifetime but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell he commonly held his head to one side... moving his body backwards and forwards and rubbing his left knee in the same direction with the palm of his hand... e made various sounds like a half whistle or as if clucking like a hen and ... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period in the course of a dispute by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation he used to blow out his breath like a whale. There are many similar accounts; in particular Johnson was said to perform his gesticulations at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way Johnson responded From bad habit. The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report and Tourette syndrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome. Details provided by the writings of Boswell Hester Thrale and others reinforce the diagnosis with one paper concluding Johnson was in the words of Steven Lynn more than a well-known writer and scholar; he was a celebrity for the activities and the state of his health in his later years were constantly reported in various journals and newspapers and when there was nothing to report something was invented. According to Bate Johnson loved biography and he changed the whole course of biography for the modern world. One by-product was the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature Boswells Life of Johnson and there were many other memoirs and biographies of a similar kind written on Johnson after his death. These accounts of his life include Thomas Tyerss A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson ; Boswells The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides ; Hester Thrales Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson which drew on entries from her diary and other notes; John Hawkinss Life of Samuel Johnson the first full-length biography of Johnson; and in 1792 Arthur Murphys An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson which replaced Hawkinss biography as the introduction to a collection of Johnsons Works. Another important source was Fanny Burney who described Johnson as the acknowledged Head of Literature in this kingdom and kept a diary containing details missing from other biographies. Above all Boswells portrayal of Johnson is the work best known to general readers. Although critics like Donald Greene argue about its status as a true biography the work became successful as Boswell and his friends promoted it at the expense of the many other works on Johnsons life. In criticism Johnson had a lasting influence although not everyone viewed him favourably. Some like Macaulay regarded Johnson as an idiot savant who produced some respectable works and others like the Romantic poets were completely opposed to Johnsons views on poetry and literature especially with regard to Milton. However some of their contemporaries disagreed Stendhals Racine et Shakespeare is based in part on Johnsons views of Shakespeare and Johnson influenced Jane Austens writing style and philosophy. Later Johnsons works came into favour and Matthew Arnold in his Six Chief Lives from Johnsons Lives of the Poets considered the Lives of Milton Dryden Pope Addison Swift and Gray as points which stand as so many natural centres and by returning to which we can always find our way again. More than a century after his death literary critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnsons works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets.Yvor Winters claimed that A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson.F. R. Leavis agreed and on Johnsons criticism said When we read him we know beyond question that we have here a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This we can say with emphatic conviction really is criticism.Edmund Wilson claimed that The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism. The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnsons work firmly within the Western canon describing him as unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him... Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour. Johnsons philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century. Half of Johnsons surviving correspondence together with some of his manuscripts editions of his books paintings and other items associated with him are in the Donald and Mary Hyde Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson housed at Houghton Library at Harvard University since 2003. The collection includes drafts of his Plan for a Dictionary documents associated with Hester Thrale Piozzi and James Boswell and a teapot owned by Johnson. There are many societies formed around and dedicated to the study and enjoyment of Samuel Johnsons life and works. On the bicentennial of Johnsons death in 1984 Oxford University held a week-long conference featuring 50 papers and the Arts Council of Great Britain held an exhibit of Johnsonian portraits and other memorabilia. The London Times and Punch produced parodies of Johnsons style for the occasion. In 1999 the BBC Four television channel started the Samuel Johnson Prize an award for non-fiction. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque unveiled in 1876 marks Johnsons Gough Square house. In 2009 Johnson was among the ten people selected by the Royal Mail for their Eminent Britons commemorative postage stamp issue. On 18 September 2017 Google commemorated Johnsons 308th birthday with a Google Doodle. The date of his death 13 December is commemorated in the Church of Englands Calendar of Saints. There is a memorial to him at St Pauls Cathedral in London.
James Boswell,James Boswell 9th Laird of Auchinleck 19 May 1795 was a Scottish biographer diarist and lawyer born in Edinburgh. He is best known for his biography of his friend and older contemporary the English writer Samuel Johnson which is commonly said to be the greatest biography written in the English language. A great mass of Boswells diaries letters and private papers were recovered from the 1920s to the 1950s and their ongoing publication by Yale University has transformed his reputation. Boswell was born in Blairs Land on the east side of Parliament Close behind St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh on 29 October 1740 . He was the eldest son of a judge Alexander Boswell Lord Auchinleck and his wife Euphemia Erskine. As the eldest son he was heir to his familys estate of Auchinleck in Ayrshire. Boswells mother was a strict Calvinist and he felt that his father was cold to him. As a child he was delicate. Kay Jamison Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins in her book Touched with Fire believes that Boswell may have suffered from bipolar disorder and this condition would afflict him sporadically all through his life. At the age of five he was sent to James Mundells academy an advanced institution by the standards of the time where he was instructed in English Latin writing and arithmetic. The eight-year-old Boswell was unhappy there and suffered from nightmares and extreme shyness. Consequently he was removed from the academy and educated by a string of private tutors. The most notable and supportive of these John Dunn exposed Boswell to modern literature such as The Spectator essays and religion. Dunn was also present during Boswells serious affliction of 1752 when he was confined to the town of Moffat in northern Dumfriesshire. This afforded Boswell his first experience of genuine society. His recovery was rapid and complete and Boswell may have decided that travel and entertainment exerted a calming therapeutic effect on him. At thirteen Boswell was enrolled into the arts course at the University of Edinburgh studying there from 1753 to 1758. Midway through his studies he suffered an episode of serious depression but recovered fully. Boswell had swarthy skin black hair and dark eyes; he was of average height and he tended to plumpness. His appearance was said to be alert and masculine. Upon turning nineteen he was sent to continue his studies at the University of Glasgow where he attended the lectures of Adam Smith. While at Glasgow Boswell decided to convert to Catholicism and become a monk. Upon learning of this his father ordered him home. Instead of obeying though Boswell ran away to London where he spent three months living the life of a libertine before he was taken back to Scotland by his father. Upon returning he was re-enrolled at Edinburgh University and forced by his father to sign away most of his inheritance in return for an allowance of 100 a year. On 30 July 1762 Boswell passed his oral law exam after which his father decided to raise his allowance to 200 a year and permitted him to return to London. In this period Boswell wrote his London Journal and on 16 May 1763 met Johnson for the first time. The pair became friends almost immediately though Johnson became more of a parental figure in Boswells eyes. Johnson eventually nicknamed him Bozzy. The first conversation between Johnson and Boswell is quoted in Life of Samuel Johnson as follows It was around three months after this first encounter with Johnson that Boswell departed for Europe with the initial goal of continuing his law studies at Utrecht University. He spent a year there and although desperately unhappy the first few months eventually quite enjoyed his time in Utrecht. He befriended and fell in love with Isabelle de Charrière also known as Belle van Zuylen a vivacious young Dutchwoman of unorthodox opinions his social and intellectual superior. Boswell admired the young widow Geelvinck who refused to marry him. After this Boswell spent most of the next two years travelling around the continent his Grand Tour. During this time he met Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire with a recommendation letter of Constant dHermenches and made a pilgrimage to Rome where his portrait was painted by George Willison. Boswell also travelled to Corsica to meet one of his heroes the independence leader Pasquale Paoli. His well-observed diaries and correspondence of this time have been compiled into two books Boswell in Holland and Boswell on the Grand Tour. Boswell returned to London in February 1766 accompanied by Rousseaus mistress with whom he had a brief affair on the journey home. After spending a few weeks in the capital he returned to Scotland buying the former house of David Hume on James Court on the Lawnmarket. He studied for his final law exam at Edinburgh University. He passed the exam and became an advocate. He practised for over a decade during which time he spent no more than a month every year with Johnson. Nevertheless he returned to London annually to mingle with Johnson and the rest of the London literary crowd and to escape his mundane existence in Scotland. He found enjoyment in playing the intellectual rhyming game crambo with his peers. Some of his journal entries and letters from this period describe his amatory exploits. Thus in 1767 in a letter to William Johnson Temple he wrote I got myself quite intoxicated went to a Bawdy-house and past a whole night in the arms of a Whore. She indeed was a fine strong spirited Girl a Whore worthy of Boswell if Boswell must have a whore. A few years earlier he wrote that during a night with an actress named Louisa five times was I fairly lost in supreme rapture. Louisa was madly fond of me; she declared I was a prodigy and asked me if this was not extraordinary for human nature. Though he sometimes used a condom for protection he contracted venereal disease at least seventeen times. Boswell was a major supporter of the Corsican Republic. Following the islands invasion by France in 1768 Boswell attempted to raise public awareness and rally support for the Corsicans. He sent arms and money to the Corsican fighters who were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769. Boswell attended the masquerade held at the Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon in September 1769 dressed as a Corsican Chief. He was also much to the chagrin of his friend Johnson a strong defender of the American Revolution. Boswell married his cousin Margaret Montgomerie on 25 November 1769. She remained faithful to Boswell despite his frequent liaisons with prostitutes until her death from tuberculosis in 1789. After his infidelities he would deliver tearful apologies to her and beg her forgiveness before again promising her and himself that he would reform. James and Margaret had four sons and three daughters. Two sons died in infancy; the other two were Alexander and James . Their daughters were Veronica Euphemia and Elizabeth known as Betsy . Boswell also had at least two extramarital children Charles and Sally . Despite his relative literary success with accounts of his European travels Boswell was only a moderately successful advocate with the exception of the copyright infringement case of Donaldson v Beckett where Boswell represented the Scottish bookseller Alexander Donaldson. By the late 1770s Boswell descended further and further into alcoholism and gambling addiction. Throughout his life from childhood until death he was beset by severe swings of mood. His depressions frequently encouraged and were exacerbated by his various vices. His happier periods usually saw him relatively vice-free. His character mixed a superficial Enlightenment sensibility for reason and taste with a genuine and somewhat romantic love of the sublime and a propensity for occasionally puerile whimsy. The latter along with his tendency for drink and other vices caused many contemporaries and later observers to regard him as being too lightweight to be an equal in the literary crowd that he wanted to be a part of. However his humour and innocent good nature won him many lifelong friends. In 1773 Boswell bought the house of David Hume on the south east corner of James Court. He lived there until 1786. Boswells residency at James Court has been well established but not the exact location. For example a later edition of Traditions of Edinburgh by Robert Chambers suggests that Boswells residence at James Court was actually in the Western wing. His James Court flat was notable for having two levels and although a modern renovation in the Eastern section reveals such a possibility it is likely that Boswells residence was a similarly equipped one in the Western section that no longer exists having burned down in the mid 1800s. Boswell became quite friendly with the 6th Earl of Dumfries as well as seeing him in Scotland he also visited him in Rosemount London in 1787 and 1788.In Boswells of November 2 1778 journal he writes I was upon my guard as I well knew that he and his Countess flattered themselves that they would get from me that road through our estate which my father had refused and which in truth I was still more positive for refusing. He saw the Earl as very attentive. Having hosted the Earl Boswell and his wife also decide to visit Dumfries House I however wished to live on civil terms with such near neighbours. On October 27 1782 Boswell writes we looked at Lord Dumfriess gate and the famous road. If Lord Eglinton if my Earl were Earl of Dumfries and living at Dumfries House he should have the road but not to him and his heirs. Boswell was a frequent guest of Lord Monboddo at Monboddo House a setting where he gathered significant observations for his writings by association with Samuel Johnson Lord Kames and other notable attendees. After Johnsons death in 1784 Boswell moved to London to try his luck at the English Bar which proved even less successful than his career in Scotland. In 1792 Boswell lobbied the Home Secretary to help gain royal pardons for four Botany Bay escapees including Mary Bryant. He also offered to stand for Parliament but failed to get the necessary support and he spent the final years of his life writing his Life of Samuel Johnson.  During this time his health began to fail due to venereal disease and his years of drinking. Boswell died in London in 1795. Close to the end of his life he became strongly convinced that the Shakespeare papers including two previously unknown plays Vortigern and Rowena and Henry II allegedly discovered by William Henry Ireland were genuine. After Boswells death they proved to be forgeries created by Ireland himself. Boswells remains were interred in the crypt of the Boswell family mausoleum in what is now the old Auchinleck Kirkyard in Ayrshire. The mausoleum is attached to the old Auchinleck kirk. When the Life of Samuel Johnson was published in 1791 its style was unique in that unlike other biographies of that era it directly incorporated conversations that Boswell had noted down at the time for his journals. He also included more personal and human details than those to which contemporary readers were accustomed. Instead of writing a strictly fact-based record of Johnsons public life in the style of the time he painted a more personal and intimate portrait of the man than was normal in biographies of the day. Macaulay and Carlyle among others have attempted to explain how a man such as Boswell could have produced a work as detailed as the Life of Johnson. The former argued that Boswells uninhibited folly and candour were his greatest qualifications; the latter replied that beneath such traits was a mind to discern excellence and a heart to appreciate it aided by the power of accurate observation and considerable dramatic ability. Boswell was present at the meeting of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in May 1787 set up to persuade William Wilberforce to lead the abolition movement in Parliament. However the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson records that by 1788 Boswell after having supported the cause ... became inimical to it.Boswells most prominent display of support for slavery was his 1791 poem No Abolition of Slavery; or the Universal Empire of Love which lampooned Clarkson Wilberforce and Pitt. The poem also supports the common suggestion of the pro-slavery movement that the slaves actually enjoyed their lot The cheerful gang the negroes see Perform the task of industry. In the 1920s a great part of Boswells private papers including intimate journals for much of his life were discovered at Malahide Castle north of Dublin. These provide a hugely revealing insight into the life and thoughts of the man. They were sold to the American collector Ralph H. Isham and have since passed to Yale University which has published popular and scholarly editions of his journals and correspondence. A second cache was discovered soon after and also purchased by Isham. A substantially longer edition of The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides was published in 1936 based on his original manuscript edited by L. F. Powell. His London Journal 176263 the first of the Yale journal publications appeared in 1950. The last popular edition The Great Biographer 17891795 was published in 1989. Publication of the research edition of Boswells journals and letters each including never before published material was ceased by Yale University in June 2021 prior to the completion of the project. These detailed and frank journals include voluminous notes on the Grand Tour of Europe that he took as a young man and subsequently of his tour of Scotland with Johnson. His journals also record meetings and conversations with eminent individuals belonging to The Club including Lord Monboddo David Garrick Edmund Burke Joshua Reynolds and Oliver Goldsmith. It is since the discovery of these journals that Boswell has become recognized as a major literary artist. In his openness to every nuance of feeling his delicacy in capturing fugitive sentiments and revealing gestures his comic self-regard and self-contempt Boswell was willing to express what other authors of the time repressed. Boswell was initiated into Freemasonry in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning on 14 August 1759. He subsequently became Master of that Lodge in 1773 and in that year was Senior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. From 1776 to 1777 he was the Depute Grand Master of that Grand Lodge. Boswells surname has passed into the English language as a term for a constant companion and observer especially one who records those observations in print. In A Scandal in Bohemia Sir Arthur Conan Doyles character Sherlock Holmes affectionately says of Dr. Watson who narrates the tales I am lost without my Boswell. The comedy Young Auchinleck by Scottish playwright Robert McLellan depicts Boswells various courtships and troubled relations with his father in the period after his return to Scotland in 1766 culminating in his eventual marriage to his cousin Margaret Montgomery in 1769 on the same day as his fathers second marriage in a different part of the country. The play was first produced at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1962 and adapted for BBC Television in 1965. In 1981 the cartoonist R. Crumb published the piece Boswells London Journal in the anthology magazine Weirdo. Presented as a Klassic Komic the piece featured meticulous cross-hatched illustrations and excerpts from Boswells writing to tell a satirical story of the young Boswell attempting to establish himself in London society dallying with prostitutes and suffering from venereal disease. Boswell was played by John Sessions in Boswell Johnsons Tour of the Western Isles a 1993 BBC 2 play. In February and March 2015 BBC Radio 4 broadcast three episodes of Boswells Lives writer Jon Canters comedic take on Boswell meeting later historical figures for the purposes of biographing them. Boswell was played by Miles Jupp. American novelist Philip Baruth wrote a fictional account of James Boswells early life in The Brothers Boswell . The novel which includes scenes that feature Samuel Johnson is a thriller that focuses on the tense relationship between James and his younger brother John. Boswell also features as a character in James Robertsons novel Joseph Knight . After Boswells private papers were recovered and brought together by Ralph Isham they were acquired by Yale University where a dedicated office was established to edit and publish his journals and correspondence. The journals have been published in 13 volumes as follows.
Charlotte Smith,Charlotte Smith 4 May 1749 1806-10-2828 October 1806 was an English novelist and poet of the School of Sensibility whose Elegiac Sonnets contributed to the revival of the form in England. She also helped to set conventions for Gothic fiction and wrote political novels of sensibility. Despite ten novels four childrens books and other works she saw herself mainly as a poet and expected to be remembered for that. Smith left her husband and began writing to support their children. Her struggles for legal independence as a woman affect her poetry novels and autobiographical prefaces. She is credited with turning the sonnet into an expression of woeful sentiment and her early novels show development in sentimentality. Later novels such as Desmond and The Old Manor House praised the ideals of the French Revolution. Waning interest left her destitute by 1803. Barely able to hold a pen she sold her book collection to pay debts and died in 1806. Largely forgotten by the mid-19th century she has since been seen as a major Romantic precursor. Charlotte Turner was born on 4 May 1749 in London and baptised on 12 June as the oldest child of well-to-do Nicholas Turner and Anna Towers. Her two siblings Nicholas and Catherine Ann were born over the next five years. Smith received a typical girls education in a wealthy late 18th-century family. Her childhood was marked by her mothers early death and her fathers reckless spending. After losing his wife Nicholas Turner travelled and the children were raised by Lucy Towers their maternal aunt; when exactly their father returned is unknown. At the age of six Charlotte went to school in Chichester and took drawing lessons from the painter George Smith. Two years later she her aunt and her sister moved to London where she attended a girls school in Kensington and learned dancing drawing music and acting. She loved to read and wrote poems which her father encouraged. She even submitted a few to the Ladys Magazine for publication but they were not accepted. Nicholas Turner met with financial difficulties on his return to England and had to sell some of the familys holdings. He married the wealthy Henrietta Meriton in 1765. His daughter entered society at the age of 12 leaving school and being tutored at home. His reckless spending then forced her to marry early. In a marriage on 23 February 1765 at the age of 15 which she later described as prostitution she was given by her father to a violent profligate man Benjamin Smith son of Richard Smith a wealthy West Indian merchant and a director of the East India Company. The marriage proposal was accepted for her by her father. Condemning his action 40 years later Smith said it had turned her into a legal prostitute. The Smiths had twelve children. Their first in 1766 died the next year just days after the birth of their second Benjamin Berney . Their ten more children between 1767 and 1785 were William Towers Charlotte Mary Braithwaite Nicholas Hankey Charles Dyer Anna Augusta Lucy Eleanor Lionel Harriet and George . Six of their children survived her. The Smith marriage was unhappy. She detested living in commercial Cheapside and argued with her in-laws whom she saw as unrefined and uneducated. They in turn mocked her for spending time reading writing and drawing. Meanwhile Benjamin proved violent unfaithful and profligate. Only her father-in-law Richard appreciated her writing abilities although he wanted her to use them to further his business interests. Richard Smith owned plantations in Barbados which provided the income of 2000 a year upon which Charlotte Smith and her family lived. Smith would later criticize slavery in works such as The Old Manor House and Beachy Head . She persuaded Richard to set Benjamin up as a gentleman farmer in Hampshire and lived with him from 1774 until 1783 at Lys FarmBramdean about 10 miles east of Winchester. Worried about Charlottes future and that of his grandchildren and concerned that his son would continue his irresponsible ways Richard Smith willed most of his property to Charlottes children. However he drew up the will himself and it contained legal problems. The inheritance originally worth nearly 36000 was tied up in chancery after his death in 1776 for almost 40 years. Smith and her children saw little of it. It has been proposed that this may have inspired the famous fictional case of interminable legal proceedings Jarndyce and Jarndyce in Dickenss Bleak House. In fact Benjamin illegally spent at least a third of the legacy and ended up in Kings Bench Prison a debtors prison in December 1783. Smith moved in with him and it was there that she wrote and published her first work.Elegiac Sonnets achieved instant success allowing Charlotte to pay for their release from prison. Smiths sonnets helped initiate a revival of the form and granted an aura of respectability to her later novels as poetry was then considered the highest art. Smith revised Elegiac Poems several times over the years eventually creating a two-volume work. Smiths husband fled to France to escape his creditors. She joined him there until thanks largely to her he was able to return to England. After Benjamin Smith was released from prison the entire family moved to Dieppe France to avoid further creditors. Charlotte returned to negotiate with them but failed to come to an agreement. She went back to France and in 1784 began translating works from French into English. In 1787 she published The Romance of Real Life consisting of translated selections on François Gayot de Pitavals trials. She was forced to withdraw her other translation Manon Lescaut after it was argued that the work was immoral and plagiarised. In 1786 she published it anonymously. In 1785 the family returned to England and moved to Woolbeding House near Midhurst Sussex. Smiths relations with her husband did not improve and on 15 April 1787 she left him after 22 years of marriage writing that she might have been contented to reside in the same house with him had not his temper been so capricious and often so cruel so that her life was not safe. When Charlotte left Benjamin she did not secure a legal agreement to protect her profits he would have access to them under English primogeniture laws. Smith knew that her childrens future rested on a successful settlement of the lawsuit over her father-in-laws will and so made every effort to earn enough money to fund the suit and retain the familys genteel status. Smith claimed the position of gentlewoman signing herself Charlotte Smith of Bignor Park on the title page of Elegiac Sonnets. All her works were published under her own name a daring decision for a woman at the time. Her success as a poet allowed her to make this choice and she identified herself as a poet throughout her career. Although she published far more prose than poetry and her novels brought her more money and fame she believed poetry would bring her respectability. As Sarah Zimmerman claimed in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography She prized her verse for the role it gave her as a private woman whose sorrows were submitted only reluctantly to the public. After leaving her husband Smith moved to a town near Chichester and decided to write novels as they would make more money than poetry. Her first one Emmeline was a success selling 1500 copies within months. She wrote nine more in the next ten years Ethelinde Celestina Desmond The Old Manor House The Wanderings of Warwick The Banished Man Montalbert Marchmont and The Young Philosopher . Smith was beginning her novelist career at a time when womens fiction was expected to focus on romance and to focus on a chaste and flawless heroine subjected to repeated melodramatic distresses until reinstated in society by the virtuous hero. Although Smiths novels employed this structure they also included political commentary notably support of the French Revolution through her male characters. At times she challenged the typical romance plot by including narratives of female desire or tales of females suffering despotism. Her novels contributed to the development of Gothic fiction and the novel of sensibility. Smiths novels include autobiographical characters and events. While a common device at the time Antje Blank writes in The Literary Encyclopedia few exploited fictions potential of self-representation with such determination as Smith. For example Mr and Mrs Stafford in Emmeline are portraits of Charlotte and Benjamin. She suffered sorely throughout her life. Her mother died in childbirth when Charlotte was three. Charlottes own first child died a day after her second child Benjamin Berney was born and Benjamin lived only ten years. The prefaces to Smiths novels told of her own struggles including the deaths of several of her children. According to Zimmerman Smith mourned most publicly for her daughter Anna Augusta who married an émigré... and died aged twenty in 1795. Smiths prefaces placed her as a suffering sentimental heroine and as a vocal critic of laws that kept her and her children in poverty. Smiths experiences led her to argue for legal reforms that would grant women more rights making the case for these in her novels. Her stories showed the legal economic and sexual exploitation of women by marriage and property laws. Initially readers were swayed by her arguments; writers such as William Cowper patronised her. However as years passed readers became exhausted by Smiths stories of struggle and inequality. The public shifted to the view of the poet Anna Seward who called Smith vain and indelicate for exposing her husband to public contempt. Smith moved frequently due to financial concerns and declining health. In the last 20 years of her life she lived in Chichester Brighton Storrington Bath Exmouth Weymouth Oxford London Frant and Elstead. She eventually settled at Tilford Surrey. Smith became involved with English radicals while living in Brighton in 17911793. Like them she supported the French Revolution and its republican principles. Her epistolary novel Desmond tells of a man journeying to revolutionary France and convinced of the rightness of the revolution. He contends that England should be reformed as well. The novel was published in June 1792 a year before France and Britain went to war and before the Reign of Terror began which shocked the public turning them against the revolutionaries. Like many radicals Smith criticised the French but retained the original ideals of the revolution. To support her family Smith had to sell her works and so was eventually forced as Blank claims to tone down the radicalism that had characterised the authorial voice in Desmond and adopt more oblique techniques to express her libertarian ideals. She set her next novel The Old Manor House in the American War of Independence which allowed her to discuss democratic reform without directly addressing the French situation. However her last novel The Young Philosopher was a final piece of outspoken radical fiction. Her protagonist leaves Britain for a more hopeful America. The Old Manor House is frequently deemed best novel for its sentimental themes and development of minor characters. Novelist Walter Scott labelled it as such and poet and critic Anna Laetitia Barbauld chose it for her anthology The British Novelists . As a successful novelist and poet Smith communicated with famous artists and thinkers of the day including musician Charles Burney poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge scientist and poet Erasmus Darwin lawyer and radical Thomas Erskine novelist Mary Hays playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and poet Robert Southey. An array of periodicals reviewed her works including the Anti-Jacobin Review the Analytical Review the British Critic The Critical Review the European Magazine the Gentlemans Magazine the Monthly Magazine and the Universal Magazine. Smith earned most money between 1787 and 1798 after which she was no longer so popular; several reasons have been given for the declining public interest including erosion of the quality of her work after so many years of literary labour an eventual waning of readerly interest as she published on average one work per year for twenty-two years and a controversy that attached to her public profile as she wrote on the French Revolution. Both radical and conservative periodicals criticized her novels about the revolution. Her insistence on pursuing a lawsuit over Richard Smiths inheritance lost her several patrons. Her increasingly blunt prefaces made her less appealing. To continue earning money Smith began writing in less politically charged genres. This included a collection of tales Letters of a Solitary Wanderer and the play What Is She . Her most successful foray was into childrens books Rural Walks Rambles Farther Minor Morals and Conversations Introducing Poetry . She also wrote two volumes of a history of England and A Natural History of Birds . Her return to poetry Beachy Head and Other Poems also appeared posthumously. Publishers paid less for these however and by 1803 Smith was poverty-stricken. She could barely afford food or coal. She even sold her beloved library of 500 books to pay off debts but feared being sent to jail for the remaining 20. Smith complained of gout for many years which made it increasingly difficult and painful for her to write. By the end of her life it had almost paralysed her. She wrote to a friend that she was literally vegetating for I have very little locomotive powers beyond those that appertain to a cauliflower. On 23 February 1806 her husband died in a debtors prison and Smith finally received some money he owed her but she was too ill to do anything with it. She died at Tilford a few months later on 28 October 1806 and was buried at Stoke Church Stoke Park near Guildford. The lawsuit over her father-in-laws estate was settled seven years later on 22 April 1813 more than 36 years after Richard Smiths death. Smiths novels were read and assessed by friends who were also writers as she would return the favour and they found it beneficial to improve and encourage each others work. Ann Radcliffe who also wrote Gothic fiction was among those friends. Along with praise Smith also received backlash from other writers. Jane Austen though she ridiculed Smiths novels actually borrowed plot character and incident from them. John Bennet wrote that the little sonnets of Miss Charlotte Smith are soft pensive sentimental and pathetic as a womans productions should be. The muses if I mistake not will in time raise her to a considerable eminence. She has as yet stepped forth only in little things with a diffidence that is characteristic of real genius in its first attempts. Her next public entre may be more in style and more consequential. Smith is never too specific about her republicanism; her ideas rest on the scholars Rousseau Voltaire Diderot Montesquieu and John Locke. Charlotte Smith tried not to swim too strongly against the current of public view because she needed to sell her novels in order to provide for her children. Robert Southey a poet and contributor to the early Romanticist movement also sympathised with Smiths hardships. He says she has done more and done better than other women writers it has not been her whole employment she is not looking out for admiration and talking to show off. In addition to Jane Austen Henrietta ONeill Reverend Joseph Cooper Walker and Sarah Rose were people Smith saw as trusted friends. Having become famous for marrying into a great Irish home Henrietta ONeill like Austen provided Smith with a poetic sympathetic friendship and with literary connections helping her gain an entry into a fashionable literary world to which she otherwise had little access; here she almost certainly met Dr. Moore and Lady Londonderry. One of Smiths longest friends and respected mentors was Reverend Joseph Cooper Walker a Dublin antiquarian and writer. Walker handled her dealings with John Rice who published Dublin editions of many of her works. She confided openly in Walker about literary and familial matters. Through publication of personal letters Smith sent to a close companion Sarah Rose readers are shown a more positive and joyful side to Smith. Although today his writing is seen as mediocre William Hayley another friend of Smiths was liked respected influential in their time especially as he was offered the laureateship on the death of Thomas Warton. As time went on Hayley Smith withdrew support from her in 1794 and corresponded with her only infrequently. Smith saw Hayleys actions as betrayal; he would often make claims that she was a Lady of signal sorrows signal woes. Even with her success as a writer and handful of accredited friends through her lifetime Smith was sadly isolated from other writers and literary friends. Although many believed in Hayleys statements many saw Smith as a woman of signal achievement energy ambition devotion and sacrifice. Her children and her literary career evoked from her best efforts and did so in about equal measure. Stuart Curran as editor of Smiths poems has written that she is the first poet in England whom in retrospect we would call Romantic. She helped shape the patterns of thought and conventions of style for the period and was responsible for rekindling the sonnet form in England. She influenced popular Romantic poets of her time such as William Wordsworth and John Keats. Wordsworth the leading Romantic poet believed that Smith wrote with true feeling for rural nature at a time when nature was not much regarded by English Poets. He also stated in the 1830s that she was a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered. By the mid-19th century however Smith was largely forgotten. Smith was respected also for her ten novels publishing works in a variety of genres. These include Gothic revolutionary educational epistolary but always incorporating the novel of sensibility. Although they have yet to receive any critical attention today Smith was famous for childrens books she wrote in her writing period. Smith is noted as one of the most popular poets of her time. One of the first poets to receive a salary Henry James Pye claimed Smith was in two species of composition so different as the novel and the sonnet and whose powers are so equally capable of charming the imagination and awakening the passions. Smith is known for striving to produce her writing at the same level and expectation as Anna Barbauld and famous political economist Francis Edgeworth. The inspiration she received in the 17th century from these writers helped her build an audience and dominate in certain genres. Smith was notorious for not only expressing her personal and emotional struggles but also for the anxiety and complications she faced when it came to meeting deadlines mailing out completed volumes and payment advancements. She was keen in persuading her publishers to work with her issues. Smith would submit final drafts in exchange for food lodging and expenses for her children. Other publishers willing to negotiate with Smith throughout her career as a writer were Thomas Cadell the elder Thomas Cadell the younger and William Davies. Unfortunately she also struggled with disputes from various booksellers over copyright a printers competence or the quality of an engraving for an illustration. She would argue that the time was ripe for a second edition of a novel. Smith clung to her own sense of herself as a gentlewoman of integrity. The negative sides that Smith claimed to have experienced during the publication process were perceived as self-pity by many publishers of her time affecting her relationship and reputation with them. Smiths push to be taken seriously and how she emerges as an essential figure of the Age of Sensibility is observed in her powerful use of vulnerability. Antje Blank of The Literary Encyclopedia states Few exploited fictions potential of self-representation with such determination as Smith. Her work is defined as squarely in the cult of sensibility she believed in the virtue of kindness in generosity to those less fortunate and in the cultivation of the finer feelings of sympathy and tenderness for those who suffered needlessly. Ultimately Smiths autobiographical incursions bridge the old and the new older poetic forms and an emerging Romantic voice. Smith was a skillful satirist and political commentator on the condition of England and this is I think the most interesting aspect of her fiction and the one that had most influence on later writers. Oneț felt that Smiths work rejected an identity defined exclusively by emotionality matrimony the family unit and female sexuality. Overall Smiths career in writing was rejoiced well perceived and popular until her later years of living. Smith deserves to be read not simply as a writer whose work demonstrates changes in taste but as one of the primary voices of her time and a worthy contemporary of the male romantic poets. Smiths novels reappeared at the end of the 20th century when critics interested in the periods women poets and prose writers the Gothic novel the historical novel the social problem novel and post-colonial studies argued for her significance as a writer. They concluded that she helped to revitalise the English sonnet a view found in Coleridge and others. Scott wrote that she preserves in her landscapes the truth and precision of a painter and poet. Barbauld claimed that Smith was the first to include sustained natural description in novels. In 2008 Smiths complete prose became available to the general public. The edition contains all her novels the childrens stories and rural walks.
Mary Robinson,Mary Robinson was an English actress poet dramatist novelist and celebrity figure. She lived in England in the cities of Bristol and London; she also lived in France and Germany for a time. She enjoyed poetry from the age of seven and started working first as a teacher and then as actress from the age of fourteen. She wrote many plays poems and novels. She was a celebrity gossiped about in newspapers famous for her acting and writing. During her lifetime she was known as the English Sappho. She earned her nickname Perdita for her role as Perdita in 1779. She was the first public mistress of King George IV while he was still Prince of Wales. Robinson was born in Bristol England to Nicholas Darby a naval captain and his wife Hester who had married at Donyatt Somerset in 1749 and was baptised Polle at St Augustines Church Bristol 19 July 1758 the entry noting that she was born 27 November 1756. In her memoirs Robinson gives her birth in 1758 but the year 1757 seems more likely according to recently published research . Her father deserted her mother and took a mistress when Robinson was still a child. The family hoped for a reconciliation but Captain Darby made it clear that this was not going to happen. Without the support of her husband Hester Darby supported herself and the five children born of the marriage by starting a school for young girls in Little Chelsea London . However during one of his brief returns to the family Captain Darby had the school closed . Darby died in the Russian naval service in 1785. Robinson who at one point attended a school run by the social reformer Hannah More came to the attention of actor David Garrick. Hester Darby encouraged her daughter to accept the proposal of an articled clerk Thomas Robinson who claimed to have an inheritance. Mary was against this idea; however after falling ill and watching him take care of her and her younger brother she felt that she owed him and she did not want to disappoint her mother who was pushing for the engagement. After the early marriage Robinson discovered her husband did not have an inheritance. He continued to live an elaborate lifestyle however and made no effort to hide multiple affairs. Subsequently Mary supported their family. After her husband squandered their money the couple fled to Talgarth Breconshire . Here they lived in a fairly large estate called Tregunter Park. Eventually her husband was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison where she lived with him for many months. While it was common for the wives of prisoners to live with their husbands while indebted children were usually sent to live with relatives to keep them away from the dangers of prison. However Robinson was deeply devoted to her daughter Maria and when her husband was imprisoned Robinson brought the 6-month-old baby with her. It was in the Fleet Prison that Robinsons literary career really began as she found that she could publish poetry to earn money and to give her an escape from the harsh reality that had become her life. Her first book Poems By Mrs. Robinson was published in 1775 by C. Parker. Additionally Robinsons husband was offered work in the form of copying legal documents so he could try to pay back some of his debts but he refused to do anything. Robinson in an effort to keep the family together and to get back to normal life outside of prison took the job instead collecting the pay that her husband neglected to earn. During this time Mary Robinson found a patron in Georgiana Cavendish Duchess of Devonshire who sponsored the publication of Robinsons second volume of poems Captivity. After her husband obtained his release from prison Robinson decided to return to the theatre. She launched her acting career and took to the stage playing Juliet at Drury Lane Theatre in December 1776. Robinson was best known for her facility with the breeches parts and her performances as Viola in William ShakespearesTwelfth Night and Rosalind in As You Like It won her extensive praise. But she gained popularity with playing in Florizel and Perdita an adaptation of Shakespeare with the role of Perdita in 1779. It was during this performance that she attracted the notice of the young Prince of Wales later King George IV of the United Kingdom. He offered her twenty thousand pounds to become his mistress. During this time the very young Emma Lady Hamilton sometimes worked as her maid and dresser at the theatre. With her new social prominence Robinson became a trend-setter in London introducing a loose flowing muslin style of gown based upon Grecian statuary that became known as the Perdita. It took Robinson a considerable amount of time to decide to leave her husband for the Prince as she did not want to be seen by the public as that type of woman. Throughout much of her life she struggled to live in the public eye and also to stay true to the values in which she believed. She eventually gave in to her desires to be with a man who she thought would treat her better than Mr Robinson. However the Prince ended the affair in 1781 refusing to pay the promised sum. Perdita Robinson was left to support herself through an annuity promised by the Crown in return for some letters written by the Prince and through her writings. After her affair with the young Prince of Wales she became famous for her rides in her extravagant carriages and her celebritylike perception by the public. Mary Robinson who now lived separately from her husband went on to have several love affairs most notably with Banastre Tarleton a soldier who had recently distinguished himself fighting in the American War of Independence. Prior to their relationship Robinson had been having an affair with a man named Lord Malden. According to one account Malden and Tarleton were betting men and Malden was so confident in Robinsons loyalty to him and believed that no man could ever take her from him. As such he made a bet of a thousand guineas that none of the men in his circle could seduce her. Unfortunately for Malden Tarleton accepted the bet and swooped in to not only seduce Robinson but establish a relationship that would last the next 15 years. This relationship though rumoured to have started on a bet saw Tarletons rise in military rank and his concomitant political successes Marys own various illnesses financial vicissitudes and the efforts of Tarletons own family to end the relationship. They had no children although Robinson had a miscarriage. However in the end Tarleton married Susan Bertie an heiress and an illegitimate daughter of the young 4th Duke of Ancaster and niece of his sisters Lady Willoughby de Eresby and Lady Cholmondeley. In 1783 Robinson suffered a mysterious illness that left her partially paralysed. Biographer Paula Byrne speculates that a streptococcal infection resulting from a miscarriage led to a severe rheumatic fever that left her disabled for the rest of her life. From the late 1780s Robinson became distinguished for her poetry and was called the English Sappho. In addition to poems she wrote eight novels three plays feminist treatises and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death. Like her contemporary Mary Wollstonecraft she championed the rights of women and was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution. She died in poverty at Englefield Cottage Englefield Green Surrey 26 December 1800 aged 44 having survived several years of ill health and was survived by her daughter Maria Elizabeth who was also a published novelist. Administration of her estate was granted to her husband Thomas Robinson from whom she had long been separated and who in 1803 inherited a substantial estate from his half-brother William. One of Robinsons dying wishes was to see the rest of her works published. She tasked her daughter Maria Robinson with publishing most of these works. She also placed her Memoirs in the care of her daughter insisting that she publish the work. Maria Robinson published Memoirs just a few months later. During her lifetime Robinson also enjoyed the distinction of having her image captured by the most notable artists of the period. The earliest known drawn by James Roberts II depicts Mrs. Robinson in the Character of Amanda from Cibbers Loves Last Shift in 1777. In 1781 Thomas Gainsborough produced an oil sketch Mrs. Mary Robinson Perdita and an untitled study. That year George Romney also painted Mrs. Mary Robinson and John Keyse Sherwin printed an untitled portrait. Joshua Reynolds sketched a study for what became Portrait of a Lady in 1782 and in 1784 he finished Mrs Robinson as Contemplation for which he also sketched a study. George Dance the Younger sketched a later portrait in 1793. In 1792 Robinson published her most popular novel which was a Gothic novel titled Vancenza; or The Dangers of Credulity. The books were sold out by lunch time on the first day and five more editions quickly followed making it one of the top-selling novels in the latter part of the eighteenth century. It did not receive either critical or popular acclaim. In 1794 she wrote The Widow; or A Picture of Modern Times which portrayed themes of manners in the fashionable world. Since Robinson was a fashion icon and very much involved in the fashion world the novel did not get a lot of favourable reception in 1794 as it might have now. In 1796 she wrote Angelina A Novel. It cost more money than it brought in. Through this novel she offers her thoughts on the afterlife of her literary career. There has been an increase in scholarly attention to Robinsons literary output in recent years. While most of the early literature written about Robinson focused on her sexuality emphasising her affairs and fashions she also spoke out about womans place in the literary world for which she began to receive the attention of feminists and literary scholars in the 1990s. Robinson recognised that women writers were deeply ambivalent about the myths of authorship their male counterparts had created and as a result she sought to elevate womans place in the literary world by recognising women writers in her own work. In A Letter to the Women of England Robinson includes an entire page dedicated to English women writers to support her notion that they were just as capable as men of being successful in the literary world. These ideas have continued to keep Mary Robinson relevant in literary discussions today. In addition to maintaining literary and cultural notability she has re-attained a degree of celebrity in recent years when several biographies of her appeared including one by Paula Byrne entitled Perdita The Literary Theatrical and Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson that became a top-ten best-seller after being selected for the Richard Judy Book Club. An eight-volume scholarly edition of Robinsons complete works was published in 20092010. In 2011 Daniel Robinson editor of the poetry for the edition published the first scholarly monograph to focus exclusively on her literary achievement--The Poetry of Mary Robinson Form and Fame. A second monograph on Robinsons literary career Mary Robinson and the Genesis of Romanticism Literary Dialogues and Debts 1784-1821 by Ashley Cross appeared in 2016. Although Robinsons novels were not as successful as she hoped she had a talent for her poetry. Her ability to produce poetry can be seen furthermore in her poems titled Sappho and Phaeon. Since the press had given her the name The English Sappho a clear relationship can be drawn between these poems and her literary name. The poems are love poems and many scholars have come to the conclusion that they represent her affairs with the Prince of Wales. Mary Darby Robinson was not only praised in literary circles for her poetry but also for her works written in prose. The two best known examples are A Letter to the Women of England and The Natural Daughter . Both her works are dealing with the role of women during the Romantic Era. Mary Robinson as much as Mary Wollenstonecraft tried to put the focus on how inferior women were treated in comparison to men. The discrepancy can be seen in both of her works. The Natural Daughter can be seen as an autobiography of Mary Robinson. The characters are in many ways patterns of her own life and the stages of her life. All the characters are symbols of her own coming of age or people she met in her life. From the late 1780s Robinson striving to separate herself from her past scandals and life as a theatre actress turned to writing as a full-time career. Robinson disregarding her previous associations with the nickname Perdita meaning lost one soon became distinguished for her poetry and was reclassified as the English Sappho by the English public. During her 25-year writing career from 1775 until her premature death in 1800 Robinson produced an immense body of work. In addition to eight collections of poems Robinson wrote eight novels three plays feminist treatises and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death. Poems by Mrs. Robinson was published by C. Parker in London in 1775. Poems consisted of twenty-six ballads odes and elegies that echo traditional values praising values such as charity sincerity and innocence particularly in a woman. Robinsons husband Thomas Robinson was imprisoned at the Kings Bench Prison for fifteen months for the gambling debts he acquired. Robinson originally intended for the profits made from this collection to help pay off his debts. But the publication of Poems could not prevent his imprisonment. Robinson lived for nine months and three weeks with Thomas and their baby within the squalor of prison. Motivated by the months she spent in prison Robinson wrote Captivity; a Poem and Celadon and Lydia a Tale published by T. Becket in London in 1777. This collection described the horrors of captivity and painted a sympathetic picture of the wretch and the guiltless partners of his poignant woes...The poem ends admonishing people to open their hearts and to pity the unfortunate... Following the publication of Captivity Robinson established a new poetic identity for herself. Robinson let go of her Della Cruscan style when she wrote Poems by Mary Robinson published in 1791 by J. Bell in London and Poems by Mrs. Robinson published in 1793 by T. Spilsbury in London. A review was written by the Gentlemans Magazine and the reviewer stated that if Robinson had been less blessed with beauty and captivating mannersher poetical taste might have been confined in its influence. At the end of the review the Gentlemans Magazine describes her poetry as elegant and harmonious. In 1795 Robinson wrote a satirical poem titled Londons Summer Morning but it was published after her death in 1800. This poem showcased Robinsons critical perspective of the infrastructure and society of London. Robinson described the busy and loud sounds of the industrialised city in the morning. She employed characters such as the chimney-boy and ruddy housemaid to make a heavy critique on the way English society treated children as both innocent and fragile creatures. In 1796 Robinson argued for womens rationality their right to education and illustrated ideas of free will suicide rationalisation empiricism and relationship to sensibility in Sappho and Phaon In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets. During the 1790s Robinson was highly inspired by feminism and desired to spread her liberal sentiments through her writing. She was an ardent admirer of Mary Wollstonecraft an established and influential feminist writer of the period. But to Robinsons surprise her intense feelings were not reciprocated by Wollstonecraft. While Robinson expected a strong friendship between the two of them to flourish Wollstonecraft found Robinson herself considerably less appealing than the title character of Angelina. In 1796 Wollstonecraft wrote an extremely harsh review of Robinsons work in the Analytical Review. It was this critique that was not critical or well thought out. Instead Wollstonecrafts review of Robinson proved to be relatively shallow and pointed at her jealousy of Robinsons comparable freedom. Wollstonecraft had the potential to spend more of her own time writing instead of having to entertain her husband William Goodwin. Robinsons Letter to the Women of England against Mental Subordination is still powerful reading. Robinson reiterates the rights women have to live by sexual passion. Lastly in 1800 after years of failing health and decline into financial ruin Robinson wrote her last piece of literature during her lifetime a series of poems titled the Lyrical Tales published by Longman Rees in London. This poetry collection explored themes of domestic violence misogyny violence against destitute characters and political oppression. Robinsons last work pleads for a recognition of the moral and rational worth of women Let me ask this plain and rational question-- is not woman a human being gifted with all the feelings that inhabit the bosom of man. Robinsons main objective was to respond to Lyrical Ballads written by authors Wordsworth and Coleridge; who were not as well known at the time. Although it was not as highly praised as Mary Wollstonecrafts A Vindication of the Rights of Woman published in 1792 Lyrical Tales provides a powerful critique of the division of duties and privileges between the sexes. It places Robinson firmly on the side of the feminist thinkers or modern philosophers of the 1790s as one of the strong defenders of her sex. Robinson was known as a sexualised celebrity but she was a very talented writer. Robinson did not receive recognition for her work until much later because of strict attitudes led to a rejection of the literary work of such a notorious woman. She became a lesson to young girls about the dangers of promiscuity and pleasure seeking. She was named by her friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge as a woman of undoubted genius. The collection of Poems published in 1791 had a subscription list of 600 people was headed by His Royal Highness George Prince of Wales and included many other members of the nobility. Some people subscribed because of her writing some because of her notoriety and some perhaps out of pity for the former actress now crippled and ill. Reviews were generally kind and noted traces in her poems of a sensibility that would later be termed Romanticism. Twenty years after her death the Poetical Works of The Late Mrs. Robinson was published in 1824 which speaks to her ongoing popularity. Robinsons second novel The Widow and in her controversial comedy Nobody A Comedy in Two Acts both of which according to newspaper reports offended fashionable women. Needless to say Robinsons playwright career was short-lived after all the bad reviews of her play. The upper class interpreted her satire as mockery on female gambling and it was an attack on moral legitimacy of the Whig elite. The upper class interpretation of Nobody reveals a great deal about the social and political anxieties during the revolutionary era. Robinsons poems were popular especially after she produced a variety of poems whilst working at the newspaper The Morning Post. The poetry columns had a double agenda of pleasing a substantial and diverse audience and shaping them into a select group of elite readers eager to buy and consume books. The public adored the novel Vancenza; or The Dangers of Credulity but the critical reception was mixed. Furthermore a biographer Paula Byrne recently dismissed it as a product of the vogue for Gothic fiction Novels such as Vancenza The Widow Angelina and Walsingham went through multiple editions and were often translated into French and German. They owed part of their popularity to their suspected autobiographical elements. Even when her characters were placed in scenes of gothic horror their views could be related to the experiences of their author. Mary Robinson was one of the first female celebrities of the modern era. She was dubbed as scandalous but on the other hand educated and able to be partially independent from her husband. She was one of the first women to enter the sphere of writing and to be successful there. Scholars often argue that she used her celebrity status only in her own advantage but it is to be noted how much she contributed to the awareness of early feminism. She tried to elaborate the ideas of equality for women in England during the late 18th century. Nevertheless many contemporary women were not amused with how she exposed herself to the public and ostracised her. They did not want to be associated with her since they feared to receive a bad reputation sympathising with Mary Robinson.
William Blake,William Blake was an English poet painter and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his prophetic works were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language. His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced. In 2002 Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBCs poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life except for three years spent in Felpham he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works which embraced the imagination as the body of God or human existence itself. Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views he came to be highly regarded by later critics and readers for his expressiveness and creativity and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as Pre-Romantic. In fact he has been said to be a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism. A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions. Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Despite these known influences the singularity of Blakes work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a glorious luminary and a man not forestalled by predecessors nor to be classed with contemporaries nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors. William Blake was born on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street in Soho London. He was the third of seven children two of whom died in infancy. Blakes father James was a hosier who had lived in London. He attended school only long enough to learn reading and writing leaving at the age of ten and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Blake . Even though the Blakes were English Dissenters William was baptised on 11 December at St Jamess Church Piccadilly London. The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life. Blakes childhood according to him included mystical religious experiences such as beholding Gods face pressed against his window seeing angels among the haystacks and being visited by the Old Testament prophet Ezekiel. Blake started engraving copies of drawings of Greek antiquities purchased for him by his father a practice that was preferred to actual drawing. Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of Raphael Michelangelo Maarten van Heemskerck and Albrecht Dürer. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed at least for a time a comfortable wealth. When William was ten years old his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Henry Pars drawing school in the Strand. He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of Ben Jonson Edmund Spenser and the Psalms. On 4 August 1772 Blake was apprenticed to engraver James Basire of Great Queen Street at the sum of 52.10 for a term of seven years. At the end of the term aged 21 he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blakes apprenticeship but Peter Ackroyds biography notes that Blake later added Basires name to a list of artistic adversaries; and then crossed it out. This aside Basires style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier stipple or mezzotint styles. It has been speculated that Blakes instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life. After two years Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the Gothic churches in London . His experiences in Westminster Abbey helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that ...the most immediate would have been of faded brightness and colour. This close study of the Gothic left clear traces in his style. In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey he was occasionally interrupted by boys from Westminster School who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground upon which he fell with terrific Violence. After Blake complained to the Dean the schoolboys privilege was withdrawn. Blake claimed that he experienced visions in the Abbey. He saw Christ with his Apostles and a great procession of monks and priests and heard their chant. On 8 October 1779 Blake became a student at the Royal Academy in Old Somerset House near the Strand. While the terms of his study required no payment he was expected to supply his own materials throughout the six-year period. There he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as Rubens championed by the schools first president Joshua Reynolds. Over time Blake came to detest Reynolds attitude towards art especially his pursuit of general truth and general beauty. Reynolds wrote in his Discourses that the disposition to abstractions to generalising and classification is the great glory of the human mind; Blake responded in marginalia to his personal copy that To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit. Blake also disliked Reynolds apparent humility which he held to be a form of hypocrisy. Against Reynolds fashionable oil painting Blake preferred the Classical precision of his early influences Michelangelo and Raphael. David Bindman suggests that Blakes antagonism towards Reynolds arose not so much from the presidents opinions but rather against his hypocrisy in not putting his ideals into practice. Certainly Blake was not averse to exhibiting at the Royal Academy submitting works on six occasions between 1780 and 1808. Blake became a friend of John Flaxman Thomas Stothard and George Cumberland during his first year at the Royal Academy. They shared radical views with Stothard and Cumberland joining the Society for Constitutional Information. Blakes first biographer Alexander Gilchrist records that in June 1780 Blake was walking towards Basires shop in Great Queen Street when he was swept up by a rampaging mob that stormed Newgate Prison. The mob attacked the prison gates with shovels and pickaxes set the building ablaze and released the prisoners inside. Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism became known as the Gordon Riots and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of George III and the creation of the first police force. In 1781 Blake met Catherine Boucher when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents after which he asked Catherine Do you pity me When she responded affirmatively he declared Then I love you. Blake married Catherine who was five years his junior on 18 August 1782 in St Marys Church Battersea. Illiterate Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X. The original wedding certificate may be viewed at the church where a commemorative stained-glass window was installed between 1976 and 1982. Around 1783 Blakes first collection of poems Poetical Sketches was printed. In 1784 after his fathers death Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop. They began working with radical publisher Joseph Johnson. Johnsons house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time theologian and scientist Joseph Priestley; philosopher Richard Price; artist John Henry Fuseli; early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft; and English-American revolutionary Thomas Paine. Along with William Wordsworth and William Godwin Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a Phrygian cap in solidarity with the French revolutionaries but despaired with the rise of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror in France. That same year Blake composed his unfinished manuscript An Island in the Moon . Blake illustrated Original Stories from Real Life by Mary Wollstonecraft. Although they seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage no evidence is known that would prove that they had met. In Visions of the Daughters of Albion Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfillment. From 1790 to 1800 William Blake lived in North Lambeth London at 13 Hercules Buildings Hercules Road. The property was demolished in 1918 but the site is now marked with a plaque. A series of 70 mosaics commemorates Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of Waterloo Station. The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blakes illuminated books The Songs of Innocence and of Experience The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and the prophetic books. In 1788 aged 31 Blake experimented with relief etching a method he used to produce most of his books paintings pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier illuminated manuscripts. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief . This is a reversal of the usual method of etching where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid and the plate printed by the intaglio method. Relief etching was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype a process invented in 1725 consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving but Blakes innovation was as described above very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in watercolours and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works including Songs of Innocence and of Experience The Book of Thel The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and Jerusalem. Although Blake has become better known for his relief etching his commercial work largely consisted of intaglio engraving the standard process of engraving in the 18th century in which the artist incised an image into the copper plate a complex and laborious process with plates taking months or years to complete but as Blakes contemporary John Boydell realised such engraving offered a missing link with commerce enabling artists to connect with a mass audience and became an immensely important activity by the end of the 18th century. Europe Supported by Africa and America is an engraving by Blake held in the collection of the University of Arizona Museum of Art. The engraving was for a book written by Blakes friend John Gabriel Stedman called The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam . It depicts three women embracing one another. Black Africa and White Europe hold hands in a gesture of equality as the barren earth blooms beneath their feet. Europe wears a string of pearls while her sisters Africa and America are depicted wearing slave bracelets. Some scholars have speculated that the bracelets represent the historical fact of slavery in Africa and the Americas while the handclasp refer to Stedmans ardent wish we only differ in color but are certainly all created by the same Hand. Others have said it expresses the climate of opinion in which the questions of color and slavery were at that time being considered and which Blakes writings reflect. Blake employed intaglio engraving in his own work such as for his Illustrations of the Book of Job completed just before his death. Most critical work has concentrated on Blakes relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art but a 2009 study drew attention to Blakes surviving plates including those for the Book of Job they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as repoussage a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques typical of engraving work of the time are very different from the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete. Blakes marriage to Catherine was close and devoted until his death. Blake taught Catherine to write and she helped him colour his printed poems. Gilchrist refers to stormy times in the early years of the marriage. Some biographers have suggested that Blake tried to bring a concubine into the marriage bed in accordance with the beliefs of the more radical branches of the Swedenborgian Society but other scholars have dismissed these theories as conjecture.In his Dictionary Samuel Foster Damon suggests that Catherine may have had a stillborn daughter for which The Book of Thel is an elegy. That is how he rationalizes the Books unusual ending but notes that he is speculating. In 1800 Blake moved to a cottage at Felpham in Sussex to take up a job illustrating the works of William Hayley a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began Milton . The preface to this work includes a poem beginning And did those feet in ancient time which became the words for the anthem Jerusalem. Over time Blake began to resent his new patron believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry and preoccupied with the meer drudgery of business . Blakes disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced Milton a Poem in which Blake wrote that Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies.  Blakes trouble with authority came to a head in August 1803 when he was involved in a physical altercation with a soldier John Schofield. Blake was charged not only with assault but with uttering seditious and treasonable expressions against the king. Schofield claimed that Blake had exclaimed Damn the king. The soldiers are all slaves. Blake was cleared in the Chichester assizes of the charges. According to a report in the Sussex county paper was ... so obvious that an acquittal resulted. Schofield was later depicted wearing mind forged manacles in an illustration to Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion. Blake returned to London in 1804 and began to write and illustrate Jerusalem his most ambitious work. Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in Chaucers Canterbury Tales Blake approached the dealer Robert Cromek with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work Cromek promptly commissioned Blakes friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brothers haberdashery shop at 27 Broad Street in Soho. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration along with other works. As a result he wrote his Descriptive Catalogue which contains what Anthony Blunt called a brilliant analysis of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism. It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review in The Examiner was hostile. Also around this time Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the Discourses of Sir Joshua Reynolds denouncing the Royal Academy as a fraud and proclaiming To Generalize is to be an Idiot. In 1818 he was introduced by George Cumberlands son to a young artist named John Linnell. A blue plaque commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes at North End Hampstead. Through Linnell he met Samuel Palmer who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the Shoreham Ancients. The group shared Blakes rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65 Blake began work on illustrations for the Book of Job later admired by Ruskin who compared Blake favourably to Rembrandt and by Vaughan Williams who based his ballet Job A Masque for Dancing on a selection of the illustrations. In later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works particularly his Bible illustrations to Thomas Butts a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life. The commission for Dantes Divine Comedy came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blakes death in 1827 cut short the enterprise and only a handful of watercolours were completed with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so they have earned praise Blakes illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works but rather seem to critically revise or furnish commentary on certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text. Because the project was never completed Blakes intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blakes illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany in the margin of Homer Bearing the Sword and His Companions Blake notes Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All the Goddess Nature not the Holy Ghost. Blake seems to dissent from Dantes admiration of the poetic works of ancient Greece and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell . At the same time Blake shared Dantes distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dantes work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death Blakes central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dantes Inferno; he is said to have spent one of the last shillings he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching. Blakes last years were spent at Fountain Court off the Strand . On the day of his death Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually it is reported he ceased working and turned to his wife who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her Blake is said to have cried Stay Kate Keep just as you are I will draw your portrait for you have ever been an angel to me. Having completed this portrait Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses. At six that evening after promising his wife that he would be with her always Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house present at his expiration said I have been at the death not of a man but of a blessed angel. George Richmond gives the following account of Blakes death in a letter to Samuel Palmer He died ... in a most glorious manner. He said He was going to that Country he had all His life wished to see expressed Himself Happy hoping for Salvation through Jesus Christ Just before he died His Countenance became fair. His eyes Brightend and he burst out Singing of the things he saw in Heaven. Catherine paid for Blakes funeral with money lent to her by Linnell. Blakes body was buried in a plot shared with others five days after his death on the eve of his 45th wedding anniversary at the Dissenters burial ground in Bunhill Fields in what is today the London Borough of Islington. His parents bodies were buried in the same graveyard. Present at the ceremonies were Catherine Edward Calvert George Richmond Frederick Tatham and John Linnell. Following Blakes death Catherine moved into Tathams house as a housekeeper. She believed she was regularly visited by Blakes spirit. She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings but entertained no business transaction without first consulting Mr. Blake. On the day of her death in October 1831 she was as calm and cheerful as her husband and called out to him as if he were only in the next room to say she was coming to him and it would not be long now. On her death longtime acquaintance Frederick Tatham took possession of Blakes works and continued selling them. Tatham later joined the fundamentalist Irvingite church and under the influence of conservative members of that church burned manuscripts that he deemed heretical. The exact number of destroyed manuscripts is unknown but shortly before his death Blake told a friend he had written twenty tragedies as long as Macbeth none of which survive. Another acquaintance William Michael Rossetti also burned works by Blake that he considered lacking in quality and John Linnell erased sexual imagery from a number of Blakes drawings. At the same time some works not intended for publication were preserved by friends such as his notebook and An Island in the Moon. Blakes grave is commemorated by two stones. The first was a stone that reads Near by lie the remains of the poet-painter William Blake 17571827 and his wife Catherine Sophia 17621831. The memorial stone is situated approximately 20 metres away from the actual grave which was not marked until 12 August 2018. For years since 1965 the exact location of William Blakes grave had been lost and forgotten. The area had been damaged in the Second World War; gravestones were removed and a garden was created. The memorial stone indicating that the burial sites are nearby was listed as a Grade II listed structure in 2011. A Portuguese couple Carol and Luís Garrido rediscovered the exact burial location after 14 years of investigatory work and the Blake Society organised a permanent memorial slab which was unveiled at a public ceremony at the site on 12 August 2018. The new stone is inscribed Here lies William Blake 17571827 Poet Artist Prophet above a verse from his poem Jerusalem. The Blake Prize for Religious Art was established in his honour in Australia in 1949. In 1957 a memorial to Blake and his wife was erected in Westminster Abbey. Another memorial lies in St Jamess Church Piccadilly where he was baptised. At the time of Blakes death he had sold fewer than 30 copies of Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Blake was not active in any well-established political party. His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdmans major study Blake Prophet Against Empire A Poets Interpretation of the History of His Own Times . Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the Industrial Revolution. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with the political outcomes of the conflicts believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism. Erdman also notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing free love had their anti-slavery implications short-changed. A more recent study William Blake Visionary Anarchist by Peter Marshall classified Blake and his contemporary William Godwin as forerunners of modern anarchism. British Marxist historian E. P. Thompsons last finished work Witness Against the Beast William Blake and the Moral Law claims to show how far he was inspired by dissident religious ideas rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the English Civil War. Because Blakes later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The Vintage anthology of Blake edited by Patti Smith focuses heavily on the earlier work as do many critical studies such as William Blake by D. G. Gillham. The earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell in which the figure represented by the Devil is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works such as Milton and Jerusalem Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blakes earlier and later works. Psychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blakes late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works namely the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study The Unholy Bible suggests the later works are the Bible of Hell promised in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Regarding Blakes final poem Jerusalem she writes The promise of the divine in man made in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is at last fulfilled. John Middleton Murry notes discontinuity between Marriage and the late works in that while the early Blake focused on a sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of Marriage of Heaven and Hell is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of Urizen in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found mutual understanding and mutual forgiveness. Regarding conventional religion Blake was a satirist and ironist in his viewpoints which are illustrated and summarized in his poem Vala or The Four Zoas one of his uncompleted prophetic books begun in 1797. The demi-mythological and demi-religious main characters of the book are the Four Zoas who were created by the fall of Albion in Blakes mythology. It consists of nine books referred to as nights. These outline the interactions of the Zoas their fallen forms and their Emanations. Blake intended the book to be a summation of his mythic universeBlakes Four Zoas which represent four aspects of the Almighty God and Vala is the first work to mention them. In particular Blakes GodMan union is broken down into the bodily components of Urizen Urthona Luvah and Tharmas with paired Emanations being Ahania Enitharmon Vala and Enion . As connected to Blakes understanding of the divine the Zoas are the God the Father the Son of God the Holy Ghost and Satan who was originally of the divine substance and their Emanations represent Sexual Urges Nature Inspiration and Pleasure . Blake believed that each person had a twofold identity with one half being good and the other evil. In Vala both the character Orc and The Eternal Man discuss their selves as divided. By the time he was working on his later works including Vala Blake felt that he was able to overcome his inner battle but he was concerned about losing his artistic abilities. These thoughts carried over into Vala as the character Los is connected to the image of Christ and he added a Christian element to his mythic world. In the revised version of Vala Blake added Christian and Hebrew images and describes how Los experiences a vision of the Lamb of God that regenerates Loss spirit. In opposition to Christ is Urizen and the Synagogue of Satan who later crucifies Christ. It is from them that Deism is born. Blake did not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul but sees the body as an extension of the soul derived from the discernment of the senses. Thus the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul. Elsewhere he describes Satan as the state of error and as beyond salvation. Blake opposed the sophistry of theological thought that excuses pain admits evil and apologises for injustice. He abhorred self-denial which he associated with religious repression and particularly sexual repression Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence.  He saw the concept of sin as a trap to bind mens desires and believed that restraint in obedience to a moral code imposed from the outside was against the spirit of life Abstinence sows sand all overThe ruddy limbs flaming hairBut Desire GratifiedPlants fruits beauty there.  He did not hold with the doctrine of God as Lord an entity separate from and superior to mankind; this is shown clearly in his words about Jesus Christ He is the only God ... and so am I and so are you. A telling phrase in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast. Blake had a complex relationship with Enlightenment philosophy. His championing of the imagination as the most important element of human existence ran contrary to Enlightenment ideals of rationalism and empiricism. Due to his visionary religious beliefs he opposed the Newtonian view of the universe. This mindset is reflected in an excerpt from Blakes Jerusalem I turn my eyes to the Schools Universities of EuropeAnd there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages direWashd by the Water-wheels of Newton. black the clothIn heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel WorksOf many Wheels I view wheel without wheel with cogs tyrannicMoving by compulsion each other not as those in Eden whichWheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony peace.  Blake believed the paintings of Sir Joshua Reynolds which depict the naturalistic fall of light upon objects were products entirely of the vegetative eye and he saw Locke and Newton as the true progenitors of Sir Joshua Reynolds aesthetic. The popular taste in the England of that time for such paintings was satisfied with mezzotints prints produced by a process that created an image from thousands of tiny dots upon the page. Blake saw an analogy between this and Newtons particle theory of light. Accordingly Blake never used the technique opting rather to develop a method of engraving purely in fluid line insisting that It has been supposed that despite his opposition to Enlightenment principles Blake arrived at a linear aesthetic that was in many ways more similar to the Neoclassical engravings of John Flaxman than to the works of the Romantics with whom he is often classified. However Blakes relationship with Flaxman seems to have grown more distant after Blakes return from Felpham and there are surviving letters between Flaxman and Hayley wherein Flaxman speaks ill of Blakes theories of art. Blake further criticized Flaxmans styles and theories of art in his responses to criticism made against his print of Chaucers Caunterbury Pilgrims in 1810. Since his death Blake has been claimed by those of various movements who apply his complex and often elusive use of symbolism and allegory to the issues that concern them. In particular Blake is sometimes considered a forerunner of the 19th-century free love movement a broad reform tradition starting in the 1820s that held that marriage is slavery and advocated the removal of all state restrictions on sexual activity such as homosexuality prostitution and adultery culminating in the birth control movement of the early 20th century. Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsjö who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century free love movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was legal prostitution and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements . Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue. At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage in part due to Catherines apparent inability to bear children he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house. His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as Why should I be bound to thee O my lovely Myrtle-tree and Earths Answer seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem London he speaks of the Marriage-Hearse plagued by the youthful Harlots curse the result alternately of false Prudence andor Harlotry. Visions of the Daughters of Albion is widely read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake law and love are opposed and he castigates the frozen marriage-bed. In Visions Blake writes Till she who burns with youth and knows no fixed lot is boundIn spells of law to one she loathes and must she drag the chainOf life in weary lust  In the 19th century poet and free love advocate Algernon Charles Swinburne wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises sacred natural love that is not bound by anothers possessive jealousy the latter characterised by Blake as a creeping skeleton. Swinburne notes how Blakes Marriage of Heaven and Hell condemns the hypocrisy of the pale religious letchery of advocates of traditional norms. Another 19th-century free love advocate Edward Carpenter was influenced by Blakes mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions. In the early 20th century Pierre Berger described how Blakes views echo Mary Wollstonecrafts celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty the former being the true measure of purity. Irene Langridge notes that in Blakes mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of the soul. Michael Davis 1977 book William Blake a New Kind of Man suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity condemning him to a frozen death. As a theological writer Blake has a sense of human fallenness. S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication. Thomas Wrights 1928 book Life of William Blake notes that Blake thinks marriage should in practice afford the joy of love but notes that in reality it often does not as a couples knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blakes early mythological poems such as Ahania as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity as these are born from pride and jealousy. Some scholars have noted that Blakes views on free love are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as The Sick Rose. Magnus Ankarsjö notes that while the hero of Visions of the Daughters of Albion is a strong advocate of free love by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown crying Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water Ankarsjö also notes that a major inspiration to Blake Mary Wollstonecraft similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blakes aforementioned sense of human fallenness Ankarsjö thinks Blake does not fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained. Ankarsjö records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners though David Worrall read The Book of Thel as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church. Blakes later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems and there is advocacy of self-denial though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion. Berger is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems . However the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness redemption and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships. Northrop Frye commenting on Blakes consistency in strongly held views notes Blake himself says that his notes on Reynolds written at fifty are exactly Similar to those on Locke and Bacon written when he was very Young. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency then foolish or otherwise is one of Blakes chief preoccupations just as self-contradiction is always one of his most contemptuous comments. Blake abhorred slavery and believed in racial and sexual equality. Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity As all men are alike . In one poem narrated by a black child white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds which exist only until one learns to bear the beams of love When I from black and he from white cloud freeAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joyIll shade him from the heat till he can bearTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.And then Ill stand and stroke his silver hairAnd be like him and he will then love me.  Blake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in Songs of Experience in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God whose restrictions he rejected and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence. From a young age William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when according to one anecdote the young artist saw God when God put his head to the window causing Blake to break into screaming. At the age of eight or ten in Peckham Rye London Blake claimed to have seen a tree filled with angels bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars. According to Blakes Victorian biographer Gilchrist he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive his mother seems to have been especially so and several of Blakes early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber. On another occasion Blake watched haymakers at work and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them. Blake claimed to experience visions throughout his life. They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blakes works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by Archangels to create his artistic works which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to William Hayley dated 6 May 1800 four days after the death of Hayleys son Blake wrote I know that our deceased friends are more really with us than when they were apparent to our mortal part. Thirteen years ago I lost a brother and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit and see him in my remembrance in the region of my imagination. I hear his advice and even now write from his dictate. In a letter to John Flaxman dated 21 September 1800 Blake wrote In a letter to Thomas Butts dated 25 April 1803 Blake wrote Now I may say to you what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoyd that I may converse with my friends in Eternity See Visions Dream Dreams prophecy speak Parables unobservd at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness but Doubts are always pernicious Especially when we Doubt our Friends. Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up then not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation that to me it is hindrance not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me. What it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty I question not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a Window concerning a Sight I look thro it not with it.  Despite seeing angels and God Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London. Aware of Blakes visions William Wordsworth commented There was no doubt that this poor man was mad but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott. In a more deferential vein John William Cousins wrote in A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature that Blake was a truly pious and loving soul neglected and misunderstood by the world but appreciated by an elect few who led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations. Blakes sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica whose entry on Blake comments that the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence. Blakes work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time Alexander Gilchrist began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the Life of William Blake rapidly transformed Blakes reputation in particular as he was taken up by Pre-Raphaelites and associated figures in particular Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. In the 20th century however Blakes work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blakes standing in literary and artistic circles included S. Foster Damon Geoffrey Keynes Northrop Frye and David V. Erdman. While Blake had a significant role in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. William Butler Yeats who edited an edition of Blakes collected works in 1893 drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blakes conceptions of non-mimetic visionary practice in the painting of artists such as Paul Nash and Graham Sutherland. His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams who set his works. Modern British composer John Tavener set several of Blakes poems including The Lamb and The Tyger. Many such as June Singer have argued that Blakes thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung. In Jungs own words Blake a tantalizing study since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes. Similarly Diana Hume George claimed that Blake can be seen as a precursor to the ideas of Sigmund Freud. Blake had an enormous influence on the beat poets of the 1950s and the counterculture of the 1960s frequently being cited by such seminal figures as beat poet Allen Ginsberg songwriters Bob Dylan Jim MorrisonVan Morrison and English writer Aldous Huxley. The Pulitzer-winning composer William Bolcom set Songs of Innocence and of Experience to music with different poems set to different styles of music from modern techniques to Broadway to CountryWestern and reggae. Much of the central conceit of Philip Pullmans fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials is rooted in the world of Blakes The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Blake also features as a relatively significant character in Brian Catlings fantasy novel The Erstwhile where his visions of angelic beings are figured into the story. Canadian music composer Kathleen Yearwood is one of many contemporary musicians that have set Blakes poems to music. After World War II Blakes role in popular culture came to the fore in a variety of areas such as popular music film and the graphic novel leading Edward Larrissy to assert that Blake is the Romantic writer who has exerted the most powerful influence on the twentieth century. Major recent exhibitions focusing on William Blake include
Robert Burns,Robert Burns also known familiarly as Rabbie Burns was a Scottish poet and lyricist. He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language although much of his writing is in a light Scots dialect of English accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest. He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature. In 2009 he was chosen as the greatest Scot by the Scottish public in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV. As well as making original compositions Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland often revising or adapting them. His poem Auld Lang Syne is often sung at Hogmanay and Scots Wha Hae served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world today include A Red Red Rose A Mans a Man for A That To a Louse To a Mouse The Battle of Sherramuir Tam o Shanter and Ae Fond Kiss. Burns was born two miles south of Ayr in Alloway the eldest of the seven children of William Burnes a self-educated tenant farmer from Dunnottar in the Mearns and Agnes Broun the daughter of a Kirkoswald tenant farmer. He was born in a house built by his father where he lived until Easter 1766 when he was seven years old. William Burnes sold the house and took the tenancy of the 70-acre Mount Oliphant farm southeast of Alloway. Here Burns grew up in poverty and hardship and the severe manual labour of the farm left its traces in a weakened constitution. He was given irregular schooling and a lot of his education was with his father who taught his children reading writing arithmetic geography and history and also wrote for them A Manual of Christian Belief. He was also taught and tutored by the young teacher John Murdoch who opened an adventure school in Alloway in 1763 and taught Latin French and mathematics to both Robert and his brother Gilbert from 1765 to 1768 until Murdoch left the parish. After a few years of home education Burns was sent to Dalrymple Parish School in mid-1772 before returning at harvest time to full-time farm labouring until 1773 when he was sent to lodge with Murdoch for three weeks to study grammar French and Latin. By the age of 15 Burns was the principal labourer at Mount Oliphant. During the harvest of 1774 he was assisted by Nelly Kilpatrick who inspired his first attempt at poetry O Once I Lovd A Bonnie Lass. In 1775 he was sent to finish his education with a tutor at Kirkoswald where he met Peggy Thompson to whom he wrote two songs Now Westlin Winds and I Dreamd I Lay. Despite his ability and character William Burnes was consistently unfortunate and migrated with his large family from farm to farm without ever being able to improve his circumstances. At Whitsun 1777 he removed his large family from the unfavourable conditions of Mount Oliphant to the 130-acre farm at Lochlea near Tarbolton where they stayed until William Burness death in 1784. Subsequently the family became integrated into the community of Tarbolton. To his fathers disapproval Robert joined a country dancing school in 1779 and with Gilbert formed the Tarbolton Bachelors Club the following year. His earliest existing letters date from this time when he began making romantic overtures to Alison Begbie . In spite of four songs written for her and a suggestion that he was willing to marry her she rejected him. Robert Burns was initiated into the Masonic lodge St David Tarbolton on 4 July 1781 when he was 22. In December 1781 Burns moved temporarily to Irvine to learn to become a flax-dresser but during the workers celebrations for New Year 17811782 the flax shop caught fire and was burnt to the ground. This venture accordingly came to an end and Burns went home to Lochlea farm. During this time he met and befriended Richard Brown who encouraged him to become a poet. He continued to write poems and songs and began a commonplace book in 1783 while his father fought a legal dispute with his landlord. The case went to the Court of Session and Burnes was upheld in January 1784 a fortnight before he died. Robert and Gilbert made an ineffectual struggle to keep on the farm but after its failure they moved to Mossgiel Farm near Mauchline in March which they maintained with an uphill fight for the next four years. In mid-1784 Burns came to know a group of girls known collectively as The Belles of Mauchline one of whom was Jean Armour the daughter of a stonemason from Mauchline. His first child Elizabeth Bess Burns was born to his mothers servant Elizabeth Paton while he was embarking on a relationship with Jean Armour who became pregnant with twins in March 1786. Burns signed a paper attesting his marriage to Jean but her father was in the greatest distress and fainted away. To avoid disgrace her parents sent her to live with her uncle in Paisley. Although Armours father initially forbade it they were married in 1788. Armour bore him nine children three of whom survived infancy. Burns had encountered financial difficulties due to his lack of success as a farmer. In order to make enough money to support a family he accepted a job offer from Patrick Douglas an absentee landowner who lived in Cumnock to work on his sugar plantations near Port Antonio Jamaica. Douglas plantations were managed by his brother Charles and the job offer which had a salary of 30 per annum entailed working in Jamaica as a book-keeper whose duties included serving as an assistant overseer to the Black slaves on the plantations . The position which was for a single man would entail Burns living on a plantation in rustic conditions as it was unlikely a book keeper would be housed in the plantations great house. Apologists have argued in Burns defence that in 1786 the Scottish abolitionist movement was just beginning to be broadly active. Burnss authorship of The Slaves Lament a 1792 poem argued as an example of his abolitionist views is disputed. His name is absent from any abolitionist petition written in Scotland during the period and according to academic Lisa Williams Burns is strangely silent on the question of chattel slavery compared to other contemporary poets. Perhaps this was due to his government position severe limitations on free speech at the time or his association with beneficiaries of the slave trade system. Around the same time Burns fell in love with a woman named Mary Campbell whom he had seen in church while he was still living in Tarbolton. She was born near Dunoon and had lived in Campbeltown before moving to work in Ayrshire. He dedicated the poems The Highland Lassie O Highland Mary and To Mary in Heaven to her. His song Will ye go to the Indies my Mary And leave auld Scotias shore suggests that they planned to emigrate to Jamaica together. Their relationship has been the subject of much conjecture and it has been suggested that on 14 May 1786 they exchanged Bibles and plighted their troth over the Water of Fail in a traditional form of marriage. Soon afterwards Mary Campbell left her work in Ayrshire went to the seaport of Greenock and sailed home to her parents in Campbeltown. In October 1786 Mary and her father sailed from Campbeltown to visit her brother in Greenock. Her brother fell ill with typhus which she also caught while nursing him. She died of typhus on 20 or 21 October 1786 and was buried there. As Burns lacked the funds to pay for his passage to Jamaica Gavin Hamilton suggested that he should publish his poems in the mean time by subscription as a likely way of getting a little money to provide him more liberally in necessaries for Jamaica. On 3 April Burns sent proposals for publishing his Scotch Poems to John Wilson a printer in Kilmarnock who published these proposals on 14 April 1786 on the same day that Jean Armours father tore up the paper in which Burns attested his marriage to Jean. To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for rebuke in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays. He transferred his share in Mossgiel farm to his brother Gilbert on 22 July and on 30 July wrote to tell his friend John Richmond that Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail until I can find a warrant for an enormous sum... I am wandering from one friends house to another. On 31 July 1786 John Wilson published the volume of works by Robert Burns Poems Chiefly in the Scottish dialect. Known as the Kilmarnock volume it sold for 3 shillings and contained much of his best writing including The Twa Dogs Address to the Deil Halloween The Cotters Saturday Night To a Mouse Epitaph for James Smith and To a Mountain Daisy many of which had been written at Mossgiel farm. The success of the work was immediate and soon he was known across the country. Burns postponed his planned emigration to Jamaica on 1 September and was at Mossgiel two days later when he learnt that Jean Armour had given birth to twins. On 4 September Thomas Blacklock wrote a letter expressing admiration for the poetry in the Kilmarnock volume and suggesting an enlarged second edition. A copy of it was passed to Burns who later recalled I had taken the last farewell of my few friends my chest was on the road to Greenock; I had composed the last song I should ever measure in Scotland The Gloomy night is gathering fast when a letter from Dr Blacklock to a friend of mine overthrew all my schemes by opening new prospects to my poetic ambition. The Doctor belonged to a set of critics for whose applause I had not dared to hope. His opinion that I would meet with encouragement in Edinburgh for a second edition fired me so much that away I posted for that city without a single acquaintance or a single letter of introduction. On 27 November 1786 Burns borrowed a pony and set out for Edinburgh. On 14 December William Creech issued subscription bills for the first Edinburgh edition of Poems Chiefly in the Scottish dialect which was published on 17 April 1787. Within a week of this event Burns had sold his copyright to Creech for 100 guineas. For the edition Creech commissioned Alexander Nasmyth to paint the oval bust-length portrait now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery which was engraved to provide a frontispiece for the book. Nasmyth had come to know Burns and his fresh and appealing image has become the basis for almost all subsequent representations of the poet. In Edinburgh he was received as an equal by the citys men of lettersincluding Dugald Stewart Robertson Blair and othersand was a guest at aristocratic gatherings where he bore himself with unaffected dignity. Here he encountered and made a lasting impression on the 16-year-old Walter Scott who described him later with great admiration The new edition of his poems brought Burns 400. His stay in the city also resulted in some lifelong friendships among which were those with Lord Glencairn and Frances Anna Dunlop who became his occasional sponsor and with whom he corresponded for many years until a rift developed. He embarked on a relationship with the separated Agnes Nancy McLehose with whom he exchanged passionate letters under pseudonyms . When it became clear that Nancy would not be easily seduced into a physical relationship Burns moved on to Jenny Clow Nancys domestic servant who bore him a son Robert Burns Clow in 1788. He also had an affair with a servant girl Margaret May Cameron. His relationship with Nancy concluded in 1791 with a final meeting in Edinburgh before she sailed to Jamaica for what turned out to be a short-lived reconciliation with her estranged husband. Before she left he sent her the manuscript of Ae Fond Kiss as a farewell. On his return from Edinburgh in February 1788 he resumed his relationship with Jean Armour and they married in March 1788. He took out a lease on Ellisland Farm Dumfriesshire settling there in June. He also took up a training position as an exciseman or gauger which involved long rides and detailed bookkeeping. He was appointed to duties in Customs and Excise in 1789. Burns chose the land of Ellisland a few miles north of the town of Dumfries from Patrick Millers estate at Dalswinton where he had a new farmhouse and byre built. He and Jean moved in the following summer 1789 to the new farm house at Ellisland. In November 1790 he had written his masterpiece the narrative poem Tam O Shanter. The Ellisland farm beside the river Nith now holds a unique collection of Burnss books artefacts and manuscripts and is mostly preserved as when Burns and his young family lived there. Burns gave up the farm in 1791 to move to Dumfries. About this time he was offered and declined an appointment in London on the staff of The Star newspaper and refused to become a candidate for a newly created Chair of Agriculture in the University of Edinburgh although influential friends offered to support his claims. He did however accept membership of the Royal Company of Archers in 1792. After giving up his farm he removed to Dumfries. It was at this time that being requested to write lyrics for The Melodies of Scotland he responded by contributing over 100 songs. He made major contributions to George Thomsons A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice as well as to James Johnsons Scots Musical Museum. Arguably his claim to immortality chiefly rests on these volumes which placed him in the front rank of lyric poets. As a songwriter he provided his own lyrics sometimes adapted from traditional words. He put words to Scottish folk melodies and airs which he collected and composed his own arrangements of the music including modifying tunes or recreating melodies on the basis of fragments. In letters he explained that he preferred simplicity relating songs to spoken language which should be sung in traditional ways. The original instruments would be fiddle and the guitar of the period which was akin to a cittern but the transcription of songs for piano has resulted in them usually being performed in classical concert or music hall styles. At the 3 week Celtic Connections festival Glasgow each January Burns songs are often performed with both fiddle and guitar. Thomson as a publisher commissioned arrangements of Scottish Welsh and Irish Airs by such eminent composers of the day as Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven with new lyrics. The contributors of lyrics included Burns. While such arrangements had wide popular appeal Beethovens music was more advanced and difficult to play than Thomson intended. Burns described how he had to master singing the tune before he composed the words My way is I consider the poetic sentiment correspondent to my idea of the musical expression then chuse my theme begin one stanza when that is composedwhich is generally the most difficult part of the businessI walk out sit down now and then look out for objects in nature around me that are in unison or harmony with the cogitations of my fancy and workings of my bosom humming every now and then the air with the verses I have framed. when I feel my Muse beginning to jade I retire to the solitary fireside of my study and there commit my effusions to paper swinging at intervals on the hind-legs of my elbow chair by way of calling forth my own critical strictures as my pen goes. Burns also worked to collect and preserve Scottish folk songs sometimes revising expanding and adapting them. One of the better known of these collections is The Merry Muses of Caledonia a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. At Dumfries he wrote his world famous song A Mans a Man for A That which was based on the writings in The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine one of the chief political theoreticians of the American Revolution. Burns sent the poem anonymously in 1795 to the Glasgow Courier. He was also a radical for reform and wrote poems for democracy such as Parcel of Rogues to the Nation and the Rights of Women.  Many of Burnss most famous poems are songs with the music based upon older traditional songs. For example Auld Lang Syne is set to the traditional tune Can Ye Labour Lea A Red Red Rose is set to the tune of Major Graham and The Battle of Sherramuir is set to the Cameronian Rant. Burnss worldly prospects were perhaps better than they had ever been but he alienated some acquaintances by freely expressing sympathy with the French and American Revolutions for the advocates of democratic reform and votes for all men and the Society of the Friends of the People which advocated Parliamentary Reform. His political views came to the notice of his employers to which he pleaded his innocence. Burns met other radicals at the Globe Inn Dumfries. As an Exciseman he felt compelled to join the Royal Dumfries Volunteers in March 1795. He lived in Dumfries in a two-storey red sandstone house on Mill Hole Brae now Burns Street. The home is now a museum. He went on long journeys on horseback often in harsh weather conditions as an Excise Supervisor. He was kept very busy doing reports father of four young children song collector and songwriter. As his health began to give way he aged prematurely and fell into fits of despondency. The habits of intemperance are said to have aggravated his long-standing possible rheumatic heart condition. On the morning of 21 July 1796 Burns died in Dumfries at the age of 37. The funeral took place on Monday 25 July 1796 the day that his son Maxwell was born. He was at first buried in the far corner of St. Michaels Churchyard in Dumfries; a simple slab of freestone was erected as his gravestone by Jean Armour which some felt insulting to his memory. His body was eventually moved to its final location in the same cemetery the Burns Mausoleum in September 1817. The body of his widow Jean Armour was buried with his in 1834. Armour had taken steps to secure his personal property partly by liquidating two promissory notes amounting to fifteen pounds sterling . The family went to the Court of Session in 1798 with a plan to support his surviving children by publishing a four-volume edition of his complete works and a biography written by James Currie. Subscriptions were raised to meet the initial cost of publication which was in the hands of Thomas Cadell and William Davies in London and William Creech bookseller in Edinburgh. Hogg records that fund-raising for Burnss family was embarrassingly slow and it took several years to accumulate significant funds through the efforts of John Syme and Alexander Cunningham. Burns was posthumously given the freedom of the town of Dumfries. Hogg records that Burns was given the freedom of the Burgh of Dumfries on 4 June 1787 9 years before his death and was also made an Honorary Burgess of Dumfries. Through his five surviving children Burns has over 900 living descendants as of 2019. Burnss style is marked by spontaneity directness and sincerity and ranges from the tender intensity of some of his lyrics through the humour of Tam o Shanter and the satire of Holy Willies Prayer and The Holy Fair. Burnss poetry drew upon a substantial familiarity with and knowledge of Classical Biblical and English literature as well as the Scottish Makar tradition. Burns was skilled in writing not only in the Scots language but also in the Scottish English dialect of the English language. Some of his works such as Love and Liberty are written in both Scots and English for various effects. His themes included republicanism and Radicalism which he expressed covertly in Scots Wha Hae Scottish patriotism anticlericalism class inequalities gender roles commentary on the Scottish Kirk of his time Scottish cultural identity poverty sexuality and the beneficial aspects of popular socialising . The strong emotional highs and lows associated with many of Burnss poems have led some such as Burns biographer Robert Crawford to suggest that he suffered from manic depressiona hypothesis that has been supported by analysis of various samples of his handwriting. Burns himself referred to suffering from episodes of what he called blue devilism. The National Trust for Scotland has downplayed the suggestion on the grounds that evidence is insufficient to support the claim. Burns is generally classified as a proto-Romantic poet and he influenced William Wordsworth Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley greatly. His direct literary influences in the use of Scots in poetry were Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson. The Edinburgh literati worked to sentimentalise Burns during his life and after his death dismissing his education by calling him a heaven-taught ploughman. Burns influenced later Scottish writers especially Hugh MacDiarmid who fought to dismantle what he felt had become a sentimental cult that dominated Scottish literature. Burns had a significant influence on Alexander McLachlan and some influence on Robert Service. While this may not be so obvious in Services English verse which is Kiplingesque it is more readily apparent in his Scots verse. Scottish Canadians have embraced Robert Burns as a kind of patron poet and mark his birthday with festivities. Robbie Burns Day is celebrated from Newfoundland and Labrador to Nanaimo. Every year Canadian newspapers publish biographies of the poet listings of local events and buffet menus. Universities mark the date in a range of ways McMaster University library organized a special collection and Simon Fraser Universitys Centre for Scottish Studies organized a marathon reading of Burnss poetry.Senator Heath Macquarrie quipped of Canadas first Prime Minister that While the lovable Burns went in for wine women and song his fellow Scot John A. did not chase women and was not musical Gung Haggis Fat Choy is a hybrid of Chinese New Year and Robbie Burns Day celebrated in Vancouver since the late 1990s. In January 1864 President Abraham Lincoln was invited to attend a Robert Burns celebration by Robert Crawford; and if unable to attend send a toast. Lincoln composed a toast. An example of Burnss literary influence in the US is seen in the choice by novelist John Steinbeck of the title of his 1937 novel Of Mice and Men taken from a line in the second-to-last stanza of To a Mouse The best laid schemes o mice an men Gang aft agley. Burnss influence on American vernacular poets such as James Whitcomb Riley and Frank Lebby Stanton has been acknowledged by their biographers. When asked for the source of his greatest creative inspiration singer-songwriter Bob Dylan selected Burnss 1794 song A Red Red Rose as the lyric that had the biggest effect on his life. The author J. D. Salinger used protagonist Holden Caulfields misinterpretation of Burnss poem Comin Through the Rye as his title and a main interpretation of Caulfields grasping to his childhood in his 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye. The poem actually about a rendezvous is thought by Caulfield to be about saving people from falling out of childhood. Burns became the peoples poet of Russia. In Imperial Russia Burns was translated into Russian and became a source of inspiration for the ordinary oppressed Russian people. In Soviet Russia he was elevated as the archetypal poet of the people. As a great admirer of the egalitarian ethos behind the American and French Revolutions who expressed his own egalitarianism in poems such as his Birthday Ode for George Washington or his Is There for Honest Poverty Burns was well placed for endorsement by the Communist regime as a progressive artist. A new translation of Burns begun in 1924 by Samuil Marshak proved enormously popular selling over 600000 copies. The USSR honoured Burns with a commemorative stamp in 1956. He remains popular in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. Burns clubs have been founded worldwide. The first one known as The Mother Club was founded in Greenock in 1801 by merchants born in Ayrshire some of whom had known Burns. The club set its original objectives as To cherish the name of Robert Burns; to foster a love of his writings and generally to encourage an interest in the Scottish language and literature. The club also continues to have local charitable work as a priority. Burnss birthplace in Alloway is now a National Trust for Scotland property called the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum. It includes the humble Burns Cottage where he was born and spent the first years of his life a modern museum building which houses more than 5000 Burns artefacts including his handwritten manuscripts the historic Alloway Auld Kirk and Brig o Doon which feature in Burnss masterpiece Tam o Shanter and the Burns Monument which was erected in Burnss honour and finished in 1823.His house in Dumfries is operated as the Robert Burns House and the Robert Burns Centre in Dumfries features more exhibits about his life and works. Ellisland Farm in Auldgirth which he owned from 1788 to 1791 is maintained as a working farm with a museum and interpretation centre by the Friends of Ellisland Farm. Significant 19th-century monuments to him stand in Alloway Leith and Dumfries. An early 20th-century replica of his birthplace cottage belonging to the Burns Club Atlanta stands in Atlanta Georgia. These are part of a large list of Burns memorials and statues around the world. Organisations include the Robert Burns Fellowship of the University of Otago in New Zealand and the Burns Club Atlanta in the United States. Towns named after Burns include Burns New York and Burns Oregon. In the suburb of Summerhill Dumfries the majority of the streets have names with Burns connotations. A British Rail Standard Class 7 steam locomotive was named after him along with a later Class 87 electric locomotive No. 87035. On 24 September 1996 Class 156 diesel unit 156433 was named The Kilmarnock Edition at Girvan station to launch the new Burns Line services between Girvan Ayr and Kilmarnock supported by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport. Several streets surrounding the Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.s Back Bay Fens in Boston Massachusetts were designated with Burns connotations. A life-size statue was dedicated in Burnss honour within the Back Bay Fens of the West Fenway neighbourhood in 1912. It stood until 1972 when it was relocated downtown sparking protests from the neighbourhood literary fans and preservationists of Olmsteds vision for the Back Bay Fens. There is a statue of Burns in The Octagon Dunedin in the same pose as the one in Dundee. Dunedins first European settlers were Scots; Thomas Burns a nephew of Burns was one of Dunedins founding fathers. In November 2012 Burns was awarded the title Honorary Chartered Surveyor by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the only posthumous membership so far granted by the institution. The oldest statue of Burns is in the town of Camperdown Victoria. It now hosts an annual Robert Burns Scottish Festival in celebration of the statue and its history. In 2020 the Robert Burns Academy in Cumnock East Ayrshire opened and is named after Burns as an honour of Burns having spent time living in nearby Mauchline. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to honour Burns with a commemorative stamp marking the 160th anniversary of his death in 1956. The UK postal service the Royal Mail has issued postage stamps commemorating Burns three times. In 1966 two stamps were issued priced fourpence and one shilling and threepence both carrying Burnss portrait. In 1996 an issue commemorating the bicentenary of his death comprised four stamps priced 19p 25p 41p and 60p and including quotes from Burnss poems. On 22 January 2009 two 1st class stamps were issued by the Royal Mail to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Burnss birth. Burns was pictured on the Clydesdale Bank 5 note from 1971 to 2009. On the reverse of the note was a vignette of a field mouse and a wild rose in reference to Burnss poem To a Mouse. The Clydesdale Banks notes were redesigned in 2009 and since then he has been pictured on the front of their 10 note. In September 2007 the Bank of Scotland redesigned their banknotes to feature famous Scottish bridges. The reverse side of new 5 features Brig o Doon famous from Burnss poem Tam o Shanter and pictures the statue of Burns at that site. In 1996 the Isle of Man issued a four-coin set of Crown pieces on the themes of Auld Lang Syne Edinburgh Castle Revenue Cutter and Writing Poems. Tristan da Cunha produced a gold 5 Bicentenary Coin. In 2009 the Royal Mint issued a commemorative two pound coin featuring a quote from Auld Lang Syne. In 1976 singer Jean Redpath in collaboration with composer Serge Hovey started to record all of Burnss songs with a mixture of traditional and Burnss own compositions. The project ended when Hovey died after seven of the planned twenty-two volumes were completed. Redpath also recorded four cassettes of Burnss songs for the Scots Musical Museum. In 1996 a musical about Burnss life called Red Red Rose won third place at a competition for new musicals in Denmark. Robert Burns was played by John Barrowman. On 25 January 2008 a musical play about the love affair between Robert Burns and Nancy McLehose entitled Clarinda premiered in Edinburgh before touring Scotland. The plan was that Clarinda would make its American premiere in Atlantic Beach FL at Atlantic Beach Experimental Theatre on 25 January 2013.Eddi Reader has released two albums Sings the Songs of Robert Burns and The Songs of Robert Burns Deluxe Edition about the work of the poet. Alfred B. Street wrote the words and Henry Tucker wrote the music for a song called Our Own Robbie Burns in 1856. Burns Night in effect a second national day is celebrated on Burnss birthday 25 January with Burns suppers around the world and is more widely observed in Scotland than the official national day St. Andrews Day. The first Burns supper in The Mother Club in Greenock was held on what was thought to be his birthday on 29 January 1802; in 1803 it was discovered from the Ayr parish records that the correct date was 25 January 1759. The format of Burns suppers has changed little since. The basic format starts with a general welcome and announcements followed with the Selkirk Grace. After the grace comes the piping and cutting of the haggis when Burnss famous Address to a Haggis is read and the haggis is cut open. The event usually allows for people to start eating just after the haggis is presented. At the end of the meal a series of toasts often including a Toast to the Lassies and replies are made. This is when the toast to the immortal memory an overview of Burnss life and work is given. The event usually concludes with the singing of Auld Lang Syne. In 2009 STV ran a television series and public vote on who was The Greatest Scot of all time. Robert Burns won narrowly beating William Wallace. A bust of Burns is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. A crater on the planet Mercury has been named after Burns.

Mary Wollstonecraft,Mary Wollstonecraft was a British writer philosopher and advocate of womens rights. Until the late 20th century Wollstonecrafts life which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time received more attention than her writing. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences. During her brief career she wrote novels treatises a travel narrative a history of the French Revolution a conduct book and a childrens book. Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason. After two ill-fated affairs with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died 11 days after giving birth to her second daughter Mary Shelley who became an accomplished writer and the author of Frankenstein. Wollstonecrafts widower published a Memoir of her life revealing her unorthodox lifestyle which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century Wollstonecrafts advocacy of womens equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Wollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields London. She was the second of the seven children of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecrafts youth. The familys financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecrafts father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mothers bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters Everina and Eliza throughout her life. In a defining moment in 1784 she persuaded Eliza who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs however were severe her sister suffered social condemnation and because she could not remarry was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work. Two friendships shaped Wollstonecrafts early life. The first was with Jane Arden in Beverley. The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Ardens father a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her I have formed romantic notions of friendship... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none. In some of Wollstonecrafts letters to Arden she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life. The second and more important friendship was with Fanny Blood introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Unhappy with her home life Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a ladys companion to Sarah Dawson a widow living in Bath. However Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman . In 1780 she returned home upon being called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawsons employ after the death of her mother Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realised during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealised Blood who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to Fanny and her family throughout her life frequently giving pecuniary assistance to Bloods brother. Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially but this dream collapsed under economic realities. In order to make a living Wollstonecraft her sisters and Blood set up a school together in Newington Green a Dissenting community. Blood soon became engaged and after her marriage moved to Lisbon Portugal with her husband Hugh Skeys in hopes that it would improve her health which had always been precarious. Despite the change of surroundings Bloods health further deteriorated when she became pregnant and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her but to no avail. Moreover her abandonment of the school led to its failure. Bloods death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel Mary A Fiction . After Bloods death in 1785 Wollstonecrafts friends helped her obtain a position as governess to the daughters of the Anglo-Irish Kingsborough family in Ireland. Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough the children found her an inspiring instructor; one of the daughters Margaret King would later say she had freed her mind from all superstitions. Some of Wollstonecrafts experiences during this year would make their way into her only childrens book Original Stories from Real Life . Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor womenan impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of Thoughts on the Education of Daughters entitled Unfortunate Situation of Females Fashionably Educated and Left Without a Fortuneshe decided after only a year as a governess to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice since at the time few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787 she was trying to become the first of a new genus. She moved to London and assisted by the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson found a place to live and work to support herself. She learned French and German and translated texts most notably Of the Importance of Religious Opinions by Jacques Necker and Elements of Morality for the Use of Children by Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. She also wrote reviews primarily of novels for Johnsons periodical the Analytical Review. Wollstonecrafts intellectual universe expanded during this time not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept she attended Johnsons famous dinners and met the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the philosopher William Godwin. The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met they were disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself however became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother. In London Wollstonecraft lived on Dolben Street in Southwark; an up-and-coming area following the opening of the first Blackfriars Bridge in 1769. While in London she formed connections with members of the Blue Stockings Society and pursued a relationship with the artist Henry Fuseli even though he was already married. She was she wrote enraptured by his genius the grandeur of his soul that quickness of comprehension and lovely sympathy. She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife but Fuselis wife was appalled and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft. After Fuselis rejection Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent Vindication of the Rights of Men . She had written the Rights of Men in response to the Whig MP Edmund Burkes politically conservative critique of the French Revolution in Reflections on the Revolution in France and it made her famous overnight. Reflections on the Revolution in France was published on 1 November 1790 and so angered Wollstonecraft that she spent the rest of the month writing her rebuttal. A Vindication of the Rights of Men in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke was published on 29 November 1790 initially anonymously; the second edition of A Vindication of the Rights of Men was published on 18 December and this time the publisher revealed Wollstonecraft as the author. Wollstonecraft called the French Revolution a glorious chance to obtain more virtue and happiness than hitherto blessed our globe. Against Burkes dismissal of the Third Estate as men of no account Wollstonecraft wrote Time may show that this obscure throng knew more of the human heart and of legislation than the profligates of rank emasculated by hereditary effeminacy. About the events of 56 October 1789 when the royal family was marched from Versailles to Paris by a group of angry housewives Burke praised Queen Marie Antoinette as a symbol of the refined elegance of the ancien régime who was surrounded by furies from hell in the abused shape of the vilest of women. Wollstonecraft by contrast wrote of the same event Probably you mean women who gained a livelihood by selling vegetables or fish who never had any advantages of education. Wollstonecraft was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine whose Rights of Man would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecrafts fame extended across the English channel for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792 he visited her during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France. Wollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before Louis XVI was guillotined. Britain and France were on the brink of war when she left for Paris and many advised her not to go. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British visitors such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. During her time in Paris Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate Girondins rather than the more radical Jacobins. It was indicative that when Archibald Hamilton Rowan the United Irishman encountered her in the city in 1794 it was at a post-Terror festival in honour of the moderate revolutionary leader Mirabeau who had been a great hero for Irish and English radicals before his death in April 1791. On 26 December 1792 Wollstonecraft saw the former king Louis XVI being taken to be tried before the National Assembly and much to her own surprise found the tears flow insensibly from my eyes when I saw Louis sitting with more dignity than I expected from his character in a hackney coach going to meet death where so many of his race have triumphed. France declared war on Britain in February 1793. Wollstonecraft tried to leave France for Switzerland but was denied permission. In March the Jacobin-dominated Committee of Public Safety came to power instituting a totalitarian regime meant to mobilise France for the first total war. Life became very difficult for foreigners in France. At first they were put under police surveillance and to get a residency permit had to produce six written statements from Frenchmen testifying to their loyalty to the republic. Then on 12 April 1793 all foreigners were forbidden to leave France. Despite her sympathy for the revolution life for Wollstonecraft become very uncomfortable all the more so as the Girondins had lost out to the Jacobins. Some of Wollstonecrafts French friends lost their heads to the guillotine as the Jacobins set out to annihilate their enemies. Having just written the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French Revolution she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay even though they were not married which was unacceptable behaviour from a respectable British woman. Whether or not she was interested in marriage he was not and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealisation of the man. Despite her rejection of the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft discovered that Imlay awakened her interest in sex. Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France writing that the people under the republic still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained venal and brutal. Despite her disenchantment Wollstonecraft wrote I cannot yet give up the hope that a fairer day is dawning on Europe though I must hesitatingly observe that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce which seems everywhere to be shoving aside the point of honour of the noblesse . For the same pride of office the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation that fearing to return to obscurity after having but just acquired a relish for distinction each hero or philosopher for all are dubbed with these new titles endeavors to make hay while the sun shines. Wollstonecraft was offended by the Jacobins treatment of women. They refused to grant women equal rights denounced Amazons and made it clear that women were supposed to conform to Jean-Jacques Rousseaus ideal of helpers to men. On 16 October 1793 Marie Antoinette was guillotined; among her charges and convictions she was found guilty of committing incest with her son. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen she was troubled that the Jacobins would make Marie Antoinettes alleged perverse sexual acts one of the central reasons for the French people to hate her. As the daily arrests and executions of the Reign of Terror began Wollstonecraft came under suspicion. She was after all a British citizen known to be a friend of leading Girondins. On 31 October 1793 most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined; when Imlay broke the news to Wollstonecraft she fainted. By this time Imlay was taking advantage of the British blockade of France which had caused shortages and worsened ever-growing inflation by chartering ships to bring food and soap from America and dodge the British Royal Navy goods that he could sell at a premium to Frenchmen who still had money. Imlays blockade-running gained the respect and support of some Jacobins ensuring as he had hoped his freedom during the Terror. To protect Wollstonecraft from arrest Imlay made a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her automatically making her an American citizen. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many like Thomas Paine were arrested and some were even guillotined. Her sisters believed she had been imprisoned. Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins nightmarish. There were gigantic daytime parades requiring everyone to show themselves and lustily cheer lest they be suspected of inadequate commitment to the republic as well as nighttime police raids to arrest enemies of the republic. In a March 1794 letter to her sister Everina Wollstonecraft wrote It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind ... death and misery in every shape of terrour haunts this devoted countryI certainly am glad that I came to France because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded. Wollstonecraft soon became pregnant by Imlay and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child Fanny naming her after perhaps her closest friend. Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the Rts of Woman . She continued to write avidly despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at Le Havre in northern France she wrote a history of the early revolution An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution which was published in London in December 1794. Imlay unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft eventually left her. He promised that he would return to her and Fanny at Le Havre but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations which most critics explain as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman while others say they resulted from her circumstancesa foreign woman alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution that had seen good friends imprisoned or executed. In July 1794 Wollstonecraft welcomed the fall of the Jacobins predicting it would be followed with a restoration of freedom of the press in France which led her to return to Paris. In August 1794 Imlay departed for London and promised to return soon. In 1793 the British government had begun a crackdown on radicals suspending civil liberties imposing drastic censorship and trying for treason anyone suspected of sympathy with the revolution which led Wollstonecraft to fear she would be imprisoned if she returned. The winter of 179495 was the coldest winter in Europe for over a century which reduced Wollstonecraft and her daughter Fanny to desperate circumstances. The river Seine froze that winter which made it impossible for ships to bring food and coal to Paris leading to widespread starvation and deaths from the cold in the city. Wollstonecraft continued to write to Imlay asking him to return to France at once declaring she still had faith in the revolution and did not wish to return to Britain. After she left France on 7 April 1795 she continued to refer to herself as Mrs. Imlay even to her sisters in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child. The British historian Tom Furniss called An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution the most neglected of Wollstonecrafts books. It was first published in London in 1794 but a second edition did not appear until 1989. Later generations were more interested in her feminist writings than in her account of the French Revolution which Furniss has called her best work. Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian but she used all sorts of journals letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the revolution. She was trying to counteract what Furniss called the hysterical anti-revolutionary mood in Britain which depicted the revolution as due to the entire French nations going mad. Wollstonecraft argued instead that the revolution arose from a set of social economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789. An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution was a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft. She condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror but at same time she argued that the revolution was a great achievement which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 179394. Edmund Burke had ended his Reflections on the Revolution in France with reference to the events of 56 October 1789 when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris. Burke called the women furies from hell while Wollstonecraft defended them as ordinary housewives angry about the lack of bread to feed their families. Against Burkes idealised portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a femme fatale a seductive scheming and dangerous woman. Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy corrupted women in a monarchy because womens main purpose in such a society was to bear sons to continue a dynasty which essentially reduced a womans value to only her womb. Moreover Wollstonecraft pointed out that unless a queen was a queen regnant most queens were queen consorts which meant a woman had to exercise influence via her husband or son encouraging her to become more and more manipulative. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values by emphasising a womans body and her ability to be charming over her mind and character had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the ancien régime. In Biographical Memoirs of the French Revolution the historian John Adolphus F.S.A. condemned Wollstonecrafts work as a rhapsody of libellous declamations and took particular offense at her depiction of Louis XVI. Seeking Imlay Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795 but he rejected her. In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide probably with laudanum but Imlay saved her life . In a last attempt to win back Imlay she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia trying to locate a Norwegian captain who had absconded with silver that Imlay was trying to get past the British blockade of France. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and Marguerite her maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay many of which were eventually published as Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden Norway and Denmark in 1796. When she returned to England and came to the full realisation that her relationship with Imlay was over she attempted suicide for the second time leaving a note for Imlay Let my wrongs sleep with me Soon very soon shall I be at peace. When you receive this my burning head will be cold... I shall plunge into the Thames where there is the least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek. God bless you May you never know by experience what you have made me endure. Should your sensibility ever awake remorse will find its way to your heart; and in the midst of business and sensual pleasure I shall appear before you the victim of your deviation from rectitude. I have only to lament that when the bitterness of death was past I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured. Gradually Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life becoming involved with Joseph Johnsons circle again in particular with Mary Hays Elizabeth Inchbald and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecrafts unique courtship began slowly but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden Norway and Denmark and later wrote that If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows in a way that fills us with melancholy and dissolves us in tenderness at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin was further criticised because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice. After their marriage on 29 March 1797 Godwin and Wollstonecraft moved to 29 The Polygon Somers Town. Godwin rented an apartment 20 doors away at 17 Evesham Buildings in Chalton Street as a study so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts theirs was a happy and stable though brief relationship. On 30 August 1797 Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter Mary. Although the delivery seemed to go well initially the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; childbed fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the 18th century. After several days of agony Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again. She was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church where her tombstone reads Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman Born 27 April 1759 Died 10 September 1797. In January 1798 Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love compassion and sincerity many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecrafts illegitimate children love affairs and suicide attempts. The Romantic poet Robert Southey accused him of the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked and vicious satires such as The Unsexd Females were published. Godwins Memoirs portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic than her own writings suggest. Godwins views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as Wollstonecraft and Fuseli by British poet Robert Browning and that by William Roscoe which includes the lines Hard was thy fate in all the scenes of lifeAs daughter sister mother friend and wife;But harder still thy fate in death we ownThus mournd by Godwin with a heart of stone. In 1851 Wollstonecrafts remains were moved by her grandson Sir Percy Shelley 3rd Baronet to his family tomb in St Peters Church Bournemouth. Wollstonecraft has what scholar Cora Kaplan labelled in 2002 a curious legacy that has evolved over time for an author-activist adept in many genres... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecrafts life has been read much more closely than her writing. After the devastating effect of Godwins Memoirs Wollstonecrafts reputation lay in tatters for nearly a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth who patterned the freakish Harriet Freke in Belinda after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays Charlotte Smith Fanny Burney and Jane West created similar figures all to teach a moral lesson to their readers.  In contrast there was one writer of the generation after Wollstonecraft who apparently did not share the judgmental views of her contemporaries. Jane Austen never mentioned the earlier woman by name but several of her novels contain positive allusions to Wollstonecrafts work. The American literary scholar Anne K. Mellor notes several examples. In Pride and Prejudice Mr Wickham seems to be based upon the sort of man Wollstonecraft claimed that standing armies produce while the sarcastic remarks of protagonist Elizabeth Bennet about female accomplishments closely echo Wollstonecrafts condemnation of these activities. The balance a woman must strike between feelings and reason in Sense and Sensibility follows what Wollstonecraft recommended in her novel Mary while the moral equivalence Austen drew in Mansfield Park between slavery and the treatment of women in society back home tracks one of Wollstonecrafts favourite arguments. In Persuasion Austens characterisation of Anne Eliot as better qualified than her father to manage the family estate also echoes a Wollstonecraft thesis. Scholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecrafts works during the nineteenth century as her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work. If readers were few then many were inspired; one such reader was Elizabeth Barrett Browning who read Rights of Woman at age 12 and whose poem Aurora Leigh reflected Wollstonecrafts unwavering focus on education.Lucretia Mott a Quaker minister and Elizabeth Cady Stanton Americans who met in 1840 at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London discovered they both had read Wollstonecraft and they agreed upon the need for the Seneca Falls Convention an influential womens rights meeting held in 1848. Another woman who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot a prolific writer of reviews articles novels and translations. In 1855 she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller. Fuller was an American journalist critic and womens rights activist who like Wollstonecraft had travelled to the Continent and had been involved in the struggle for reform and she had a child by a man without marrying him. Wollstonecrafts childrens tales were adapted by Charlotte Mary Yonge in 1870. Wollstonecrafts work was exhumed with the rise of the womens suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. First was an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879 with the publication of Wollstonecrafts Letters to Imlay with prefatory memoir by Charles Kegan Paul. Then followed the first full-length biography which was by Elizabeth Robins Pennell; it appeared in 1884 as part of a series by the Roberts Brothers on famous women.Millicent Garrett Fawcett a suffragist and later president of the National Union of Womens Suffrage Societies wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of the Rights of Woman; it cleansed the memory of Wollstonecraft and claimed her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. By 1898 Wollstonecraft was the subject of a first doctoral thesis and its resulting book. With the advent of the modern feminist movement women as politically dissimilar from each other as Virginia Woolf and Emma Goldman embraced Wollstonecrafts life story. By 1929 Woolf described Wollstonecrafther writing arguments and experiments in livingas immortal she is alive and active she argues and experiments we hear her voice and trace her influence even now among the living. Others however continued to decry Wollstonecrafts lifestyle. A biography published in 1932 refers to recent reprints of her works incorporating new research and to a study in 1911 a play in 1922 and another biography in 1924. Interest in her never completely died with full-length biographies in 1937 and 1951. With the emergence of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s Wollstonecrafts works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself; for example in the early 1970s six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her passionate life in apposition to radical and rationalist agenda. The feminist artwork The Dinner Party first exhibited in 1979 features a place setting for Wollstonecraft. Wollstonecrafts work has also had an effect on feminism outside academia. Ayaan Hirsi Ali a political writer and former Muslim who is critical of Islam in general and its dictates regarding women in particular cited the Rights of Woman in her autobiography Infidel and wrote that she was inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights. British writer Caitlin Moran author of the best-selling How to Be a Woman described herself as half Wollstonecraft to the New Yorker. She has also inspired more widely. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the missing women of Asia draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in The Idea of Justice. In 2009 Wollstonecraft was selected by the Royal Mail for their Eminent Britons commemorative postage stamp issue. Several plaques have been erected to honour Wollstonecraft. A commemorative sculpture A Sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft by Maggi Hambling was unveiled on 10 November 2020; it was criticised for its symbolic depiction rather than a lifelike representation of Wollstonecraft which commentators felt represented stereotypical notions of beauty and the diminishing of women. In November 2020 it was announced that Trinity College Dublin whose library had previously held forty busts all of them of men was commissioning four new busts of women one of whom would be Wollstonecraft. The majority of Wollstonecrafts early productions are about education; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts for the improvement of young women entitled The Female Reader and she translated two childrens works Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambons Young Grandison and Christian Gotthilf Salzmanns Elements of Morality. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her conduct book Thoughts on the Education of Daughters and her childrens book Original Stories from Real Life Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos self-discipline honesty frugality and social contentment. Both books also emphasise the importance of teaching children to reason revealing Wollstonecrafts intellectual debt to the educational views of seventeenth-century philosopher John Locke. However the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of sensibility popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Both texts also advocate the education of women a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career most notably in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation. Published in response to Edmund Burkes Reflections on the Revolution in France which was a defence of constitutional monarchy aristocracy and the Church of England and an attack on Wollstonecrafts friend the Rev. Richard Price at the Newington Green Unitarian Church Wollstonecrafts A Vindication of the Rights of Men attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the Revolution Controversy in which Thomas Paines Rights of Man became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals. Wollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the Reflections Burke had lamented I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her  In her arguments for republican virtue Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality pointing out that Burkes system would lead to the continuation of slavery simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society drawn with what she says is genuine feeling to Burkes false feeling. The Rights of Men was Wollstonecrafts first overtly political work as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career. It was this text that made her a well-known writer. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be companions to their husbands rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond vitriolically to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau who wanted to deny women an education. that women should be educated for the pleasure of men. Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that womens deficient educations have placed on them; she writes Taught from their infancy that beauty is womans sceptre the mind shapes itself to the body and roaming round its gilt cage only seeks to adorn its prison. She implies that without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments women could achieve much more. While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life such as morality she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted that from the constitution of their bodies men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact how can they if virtue has only one eternal standard I must therefore if I reason consequently as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction as that there is a God. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist particularly since the word did not come into existence until the 1890s. One of Wollstonecrafts most scathing critiques in the Rights of Woman is of false and excessive sensibility particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are blown about by every momentary gust of feeling and because they are the prey of their senses they cannot think rationally. In fact she claims they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilisation these are not women who can help refine a civilisationa popular eighteenth-century ideabut women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather she believes that they should inform each other. In addition to her larger philosophical arguments Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the Rights of Woman On National Education she argues that all children should be sent to a country day school as well as given some education at home to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures. She also maintains that schooling should be co-educational arguing that men and women whose marriages are the cement of society should be educated after the same model. Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class which she describes as the most natural state and in many ways the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world. It encourages modesty and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example in her national plan for education she suggests that after the age of nine the poor except for those who are brilliant should be separated from the rich and taught in another school. Both of Wollstonecrafts novels criticise what she viewed as the patriarchal institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel Mary A Fiction the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside marriage with two passionate romantic friendships one with a woman and one with a man. Maria or The Wrongs of Woman an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecrafts most radical feminist work revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecrafts novels depict successful marriages although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman. At the end of Mary the heroine believes she is going to that world where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage presumably a positive state of affairs. Both of Wollstonecrafts novels also critique the discourse of sensibility a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroines indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental. Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecrafts novels but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum that is the most historically significant. This friendship based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument that is that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women. Wollstonecrafts Letters Written in Sweden Norway and Denmark is a deeply personal travel narrative. The 25 letters cover a wide range of topics from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with Imlay . Using the rhetoric of the sublime Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of Rousseau Letters Written in Sweden Norway and Denmark shares the themes of the French philosophers Reveries of a Solitary Walker the search for the source of human happiness the stoic rejection of material goods the ecstatic embrace of nature and the essential role of sentiment in understanding. While Rousseau ultimately rejects society however Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text. Wollstonecraft promotes subjective experience particularly in relation to nature exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecrafts desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works however she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one an attitude she associates with Imlay. Letters Written in Sweden Norway and Denmark was Wollstonecrafts most popular book in the 1790s. It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics. Godwin wrote if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author this appears to me to be the book. It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge who drew on its themes and its aesthetic. This is a complete list of Mary Wollstonecrafts works; all works are the first edition unless otherwise noted.
William Wordsworth,William Wordsworth was an English Romantic poet who with Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication Lyrical Ballads . Wordsworths magnum opus is generally considered to be The Prelude a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death before which it was generally known as the poem to Coleridge. Wordsworth was Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death from pleurisy on 23 April 1850. The second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named Wordsworth House in Cockermouth Cumberland part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the Lake District. Williams sister the poet and diarist Dorothy Wordsworth to whom he was close all his life was born the following year and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings Richard the eldest who became a lawyer; John born after Dorothy who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain the Earl of Abergavenny was wrecked off the south coast of England; and Christopher the youngest who entered the Church and rose to be Master of Trinity College Cambridge. Wordsworths father was a legal representative of James Lowther 1st Earl of Lonsdale and through his connections lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783. However he did encourage William in his reading and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory including works by Milton Shakespeare and Spenser which William would pore over in his fathers library. William also spent time at his mothers parents house in Penrith Cumberland where he was exposed to the moors but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide. Wordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended first a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families where he was taught by Ann Birkett who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities especially the festivals around Easter May Day and Shrove Tuesday. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the Spectator but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons including Mary who later became his wife. After the death of Wordsworths mother in 1778 his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School in Lancashire and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in Yorkshire. She and William did not meet again for nine years. Wordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in The European Magazine. That same year he began attending St Johns College Cambridge. He received his BA degree in 1791. He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge and often spent later holidays on walking tours visiting places famous for the beauty of their landscape. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe during which he toured the Alps extensively and visited nearby areas of France Switzerland and Italy. In November 1791 Wordsworth visited Revolutionary France and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman Annette Vallon who in 1792 gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and Britains tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year. The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The Reign of Terror left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years. With the Peace of Amiens again allowing travel to France in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in Calais. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson. Afterwards he wrote the sonnet It is a beauteous evening calm and free recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Carolines marriage in 1816 Wordsworth settled 30 a year on her payments which continued until 1835 when they were replaced by a capital settlement. It was also in 1795 that he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795 William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorseta property of the Pinney familyto the west of Pilsdon Pen. They walked in the area for about two hours every day and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote In 1797 the pair moved to Alfoxton House Somerset just a few miles away from Coleridges home in Nether Stowey. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge produced Lyrical Ballads an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworths nor Coleridges name as author. One of Wordsworths most famous poems Tintern Abbey was published in this collection along with Coleridges The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The second edition published in 1800 had only Wordsworth listed as the author and included a preface to the poems. It was augmented significantly in the next edition published in 1802. In this preface which some scholars consider a central work of Romantic literary theory Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of verse one that is based on the ordinary language really used by men while avoiding the poetic diction of much 18th-century verse. Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility and calls his own poems in the book experimental. A fourth and final edition of Lyrical Ballads was published in 1805. Between 1795 and 1797 Wordsworth wrote his only play The Borderers a verse tragedy set during the reign of King Henry III of England when Englishmen in the North Country came into conflict with Scottish border reivers. He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797 but it was rejected by Thomas Harris the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre who proclaimed it impossible that the play should succeed in the representation. The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842 after substantial revision. I travelled among unknown menI travelled among unknown menIn lands beyond the sea;Nor England did I know till thenWhat love I bore to thee.T is past that melancholy dreamNor will I quit thy shoreA second time for still I seemTo love thee more and more.Among thy mountains did I feelThe joy of my desire;And she I cherished turned her wheelBeside an English fire.Thy mornings showed thy nights concealedThe bowers where Lucy played;And thine too is the last green fieldThat Lucys eyes surveyed. Wordsworth Dorothy and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness. During the harsh winter of 179899 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in Goslar and despite extreme stress and loneliness began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled The Prelude. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar including The Lucy poems. In the Autumn of 1799 Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sisters settling at Dove Cottage in Grasmere in the Lake District this time with another poet Robert Southey nearby. Wordsworth Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the Lake Poets. Throughout this period many of Wordsworths poems revolved around themes of death endurance separation and grief. In 1802 Lowthers heir William Lowther 1st Earl of Lonsdale paid the 4000 owed to Wordsworths father through Lowthers failure to pay his aide. It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson. Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children three of whom predeceased her and William Wordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts which he intended to call The Recluse. In 179899 he started an autobiographical poem which he referred to as the poem to Coleridge and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called The Recluse. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work now generally referred to as the first version of The Prelude in 1805 but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of The Recluse. The death of his brother John also in 1805 affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works. Wordsworths philosophical allegiances as articulated in The Prelude and in such shorter works as Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworths ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792 the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveller John Walking Stewart who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering on foot from Madras India through Persia and Arabia across Africa and Europe and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled The Apocalypse of Nature to which many of Wordsworths philosophical sentiments may well be indebted. In 1807 Wordsworth published Poems in Two Volumes including Ode Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood. Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for Lyrical Ballads and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm however. In 1810 Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latters opium addiction and in 1812 his son Thomas died at the age of 6 six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland and the stipend of 400 a year made him financially secure albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813 he and his family including Dorothy moved to Rydal Mount Ambleside where he spent the rest of his life. In 1814 Wordsworth published The Excursion as the second part of the three-part work The Recluse even though he never completed the first part or the third part. He did however write a poetic Prospectus to The Recluse in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworths most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature Some modern critics suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems had been resolved in his writings and his life. By 1820 he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works. The poet William Blake who knew of Wordsworths work was struck by Wordsworths boldness in centering his poetry on the human mind. In response to Wordsworths poetic program that when we look Into our Minds into the Mind of Man- My haunt and the main region of my song William Blake wrote to his friend Henry Crabb Robinson that the passage caused him a bowel complaint which nearly killed him. Following the death of his friend the painter William Green in 1823 Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge. The two were fully reconciled by 1828 when they toured the Rhineland together. Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and Charles Lamb both died in 1834 their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of James Hogg. Despite the death of many contemporaries the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost. Wordsworths youthful political radicalism unlike Coleridges never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established Church of England reflected in his Ecclesiastical Sketches of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours The Excursion a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century. It features three central characters the Wanderer the Solitary who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the French Revolution and the Pastor who dominates the last third of the poem. Behler has pointed out the fact that Wordsworth wanted to invoke the basic feeling that a human heart possesses and expresses. He had reversed the philosophical standpoint expressed by his friend S. T. Coleridge of creating the characters in such an environment so that the public feels them belonging to the distant place and time. And it is true that this philosophical realization by Wordsworth allowed him to choose the language and structural patterning of the poetry that a common man used every day. Kurland wrote that the conversational aspect of a language emerges through social necessity. Social necessity posits the theme of possessing the proper knowledge interest and biases also among the speakers. William Wordsworth has used conversation in his poetry to let the poet I merge into We. The poem Farewell exposes the identical emotion that the poet and his sister nourish Thou like the morning in thy saffron coat Bright gowan and marsh-marigold farewell .  This kind of conversational tone persists all through the poetic journey of the poet that positions him as a man in society who speaks to the purpose of communion with the very common mass of that society. Again; Preface to Lyrical Ballads is the evidence where the poet expresses why he is writing and what he is writing and what purpose it will serve humanity. Wordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837 the Scottish poet and playwright Joanna Baillie reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully well; and when one knows how benevolent excellent he is it disposes one to be very much pleased with him. In 1838 Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the University of Durham and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford when John Keble praised him as the poet of humanity praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth. . In 1842 the government awarded him a Civil List pension of 300 a year. Following the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became Poet Laureate. He initially refused the honour saying that he was too old but accepted when the Prime Minister Robert Peel assured him that you shall have nothing required of you. Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the aging poet to take and in his depression he completely gave up writing new material. William Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of pleurisy on 23 April 1850 and was buried at St Oswalds Church Grasmere. His widow Mary published his lengthy autobiographical Poem to Coleridge as The Prelude several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece. Composer Alicia Van Buren used text by Wordsworth for her song In Early Spring. Margaret Louisa Woods portrayed the young Wordsworth in her novel A Poets Youth . Ken Russells 1978 film William and Dorothy portrays the relationship between William and his sister Dorothy. Wordsworth and Coleridges friendship is examined by Julien Temple in his 2000 film Pandaemonium. Wordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction including Isaac Asimovs 1966 novelisation of the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworths The Prelude as the miniaturised submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain comparing it to the strange seas of thought. Taylor Swifts 2020 album Folklore mentions Wordsworth in her bonus track The Lakes which is thought to be about the Lake District. In April 2020 the Royal Mail issued a series of postage stamps to mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wordsworth. Ten 1st class stamps were issued featuring Wordsworth and all the major British Romantic poets including William Blake John Keats Lord Byron Samuel Taylor Coleridge Percy Bysshe Shelley and Walter Scott. Each stamp included an extract from one of their most popular and enduring works with Wordsworths The Rainbow selected for the poet.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge,Samuel Taylor Coleridge was an English poet literary critic philosopher and theologian who with his friend William Wordsworth was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets. He also shared volumes and collaborated with Charles Lamb Robert Southey and Charles Lloyd.  He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria. His critical work especially on William Shakespeare was highly influential and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking cultures. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases including suspension of disbelief. He had a major influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson and American transcendentalism. Throughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated that he had bipolar disorder which had not been defined during his lifetime. He was physically unhealthy which may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with laudanum which fostered a lifelong opium addiction. Although experiencing a turbulent career and personal life with a variety of highs and lows Coleridges esteem grew after his death and he became considered one of the most influential figures in English literature. For instance a 2018 report by the British news agency The Guardian labeled him a genius who had progressed into one of the most renowned English poets. Organizations such as the Church of England celebrate his work during public events such as a Coleridge Day in June with these activities including literary recitals. Coleridge was born on 21 October 1772 in the town of Ottery St Mary in Devon England. Samuels father was the Reverend John Coleridge the well-respected vicar of St Marys Church Ottery St Mary and was headmaster of the Kings School a free grammar school established by King Henry VIII in the town. He had previously been master of Hugh Squiers School in South Molton Devon and lecturer of nearby Molland. John Coleridge had three children by his first wife. Samuel was the youngest of ten by the Reverend Mr. Coleridges second wife Anne Bowden probably the daughter of John Bowden mayor of South Molton Devon in 1726. Coleridge suggests that he took no pleasure in boyish sports but instead read incessantly and played by himself. After John Coleridge died in 1781 8-year-old Samuel was sent to Christs Hospital a charity school which was founded in the 16th century in Greyfriars London where he remained throughout his childhood studying and writing poetry. At that school Coleridge became friends with Charles Lamb a schoolmate and studied the works of Virgil and William Lisle Bowles. In one of a series of autobiographical letters written to Thomas Poole Coleridge wrote At six years old I remember to have read Belisarius Robinson Crusoe and Philip Quarll and then I found the Arabian Nights Entertainments one tale of which made so deep an impression on me that I was haunted by spectres whenever I was in the dark and I distinctly remember the anxious and fearful eagerness with which I used to watch the window in which the books lay and whenever the sun lay upon them I would seize it carry it by the wall and bask and read. I enjoyed the inestimable advantage of a very sensible though at the same time a very severe master...At the same time that we were studying the Greek Tragic Poets he made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons and they were the lessons too which required most time and trouble to bring up so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him that Poetry even that of the loftiest and seemingly that of the wildest odes had a logic of its own as severe as that of science; and more difficult because more subtle more complex and dependent on more and more fugitive causes...In our own English compositions he showed no mercy to phrase metaphor or image unsupported by a sound sense or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words...In fancy I can almost hear him now exclaiming Harp Harp Lyre Pen and ink boy you mean Muse boy Muse your Nurses daughter you mean Pierian spring Oh aye the cloister-pump I suppose...Be this as it may there was one custom of our masters which I cannot pass over in silence because I think it ...worthy of imitation. He would often permit our theme exercises...to accumulate till each lad had four or five to be looked over. Then placing the whole number abreast on his desk he would ask the writer why this or that sentence might not have found as appropriate a place under this or that other thesis and if no satisfying answer could be returned and two faults of the same kind were found in one exercise the irrevocable verdict followed the exercise was torn up and another on the same subject to be produced in addition to the tasks of the day. He later wrote of his loneliness at school in the poem Frost at MidnightWith unclosed lids already had I dreamtOf my sweet birthplace. From 1791 until 1794 Coleridge attended Jesus College Cambridge. In 1792 he won the Browne Gold Medal for an ode that he wrote attacking the slave trade. In December 1793 he left the college and enlisted in the 15th Light Dragoons using the false name Silas Tomkyn Comberbache perhaps because of debt or because the girl that he loved Mary Evans had rejected him. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later under the reason of insanity and he was readmitted to Jesus College though he would never receive a degree from the university. At Jesus College Coleridge was introduced to political and theological ideas then considered radical including those of the poet Robert Southey with whom he collaborated on the play The Fall of Robespierre. Coleridge joined Southey in a plan later abandoned to found a utopian commune-like society called Pantisocracy in the wilderness of Pennsylvania. In 1795 the two friends married sisters Sara and Edith Fricker in St Mary Redcliffe Bristol but Coleridges marriage with Sara proved unhappy. By 1804 they were separated. When Coleridge wrote to his brother he laid all the blame on Sara The few friends who have been Witnesses of my domestic life have long advised separation as the necessary condition of everything desirable for me.. Subsequent biographers have not agreed with Coleridges negative view of the wife he called his Sally Pally when he first married her. A third sister Mary had already married a third poet Robert Lovell and both became partners in Pantisocracy. Lovell also introduced Coleridge and Southey to their future patron Joseph Cottle but died of a fever in April 1796. Coleridge was with him at his death. In 1796 he released his first volume of poems entitled Poems on Various Subjects which also included four poems by Charles Lamb as well as a collaboration with Robert Southey and a work suggested by his and Lambs schoolfriend Robert Favell. Among the poems were Religious Musings Monody on the Death of Chatterton and an early version of The Eolian Harp entitled Effusion 35. A second edition was printed in 1797 this time including an appendix of works by Lamb and Charles Lloyd a young poet to whom Coleridge had become a private tutor. In 1796 he also privately printed Sonnets from Various Authors including sonnets by Lamb Lloyd Southey and himself as well as older poets such as William Lisle Bowles. Coleridge made plans to establish a journal The Watchman to be printed every eight days to avoid a weekly newspaper tax. The first issue of the short-lived journal was published in March 1796. It had ceased publication by May of that year. The years 1797 and 1798 during which he lived in what is now known as Coleridge Cottage in Nether Stowey Somerset were among the most fruitful of Coleridges life. In 1795 Coleridge met poet William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy. Besides The Rime of the Ancient Mariner Coleridge composed the symbolic poem Kubla Khan writtenColeridge claimedas a result of an opium dream in a kind of a reverie; and the first part of the narrative poem Christabel. The writing of Kubla Khan written about the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan and his legendary palace at Xanadu was said to have been interrupted by the arrival of a Person from Porlock an event that has been embellished upon in such varied contexts as science fiction and Nabokovs Lolita. During this period he also produced his much-praised conversation poems This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison Frost at Midnight and The Nightingale. In 1798 Coleridge and Wordsworth published a joint volume of poetry Lyrical Ballads which proved to be the starting point for the English romantic age. Wordsworth may have contributed more poems but the real star of the collection was Coleridges first version of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It was the longest work and drew more praise and attention than anything else in the volume. In the spring Coleridge temporarily took over for Rev. Joshua Toulmin at Tauntons Mary Street Unitarian Chapel while Rev. Toulmin grieved over the drowning death of his daughter Jane. Poetically commenting on Toulmins strength Coleridge wrote in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin I walked into Taunton and back again and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin. I suppose you must have heard that his daughter in a melancholy derangement suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between Sidmouth and Bere . These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian there is indeed a tear in his eye but that eye is lifted up to the Heavenly Father. Coleridge also worked briefly in Shropshire where he came in December 1797 as locum to its local Unitarian minister Dr Rowe in their church in the High Street at Shrewsbury. He is said to have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner at a literary evening in Mardol. He was then contemplating a career in the ministry and gave a probationary sermon in High Street church on Sunday 14 January 1798. William Hazlitt a Unitarian ministers son was in the congregation having walked from Wem to hear him. Coleridge later visited Hazlitt and his father at Wem but within a day or two of preaching he received a letter from Josiah Wedgwood II who had offered to help him out of financial difficulties with an annuity of 150 per year on condition he give up his ministerial career. Coleridge accepted this to the disappointment of Hazlitt who hoped to have him as a neighbour in Shropshire. From 16 September 1798 Coleridge and the Wordsworths left for a stay in Germany; Coleridge soon went his own way and spent much of his time in university towns. In February 1799 he enrolled at the University of Göttingen where he attended lectures by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. During this period he became interested in German philosophy especially the transcendental idealism and critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant and in the literary criticism of the 18th-century dramatist Gotthold Lessing. Coleridge studied German and after his return to England translated the dramatic trilogy Wallenstein by the German Classical poet Friedrich Schiller into English. He continued to pioneer these ideas through his own critical writings for the rest of his life although they were unfamiliar and difficult for a culture dominated by empiricism. In 1799 Coleridge and the Wordsworths stayed at Thomas Hutchinsons farm on the River Tees at Sockburn near Darlington. It was at Sockburn that Coleridge wrote his ballad-poem Love addressed to Sara Hutchinson. The knight mentioned is the mailed figure on the Conyers tomb in ruined Sockburn church. The figure has a wyvern at his feet a reference to the Sockburn Worm slain by Sir John Conyers . The worm was supposedly buried under the rock in the nearby pasture; this was the greystone of Coleridges first draft later transformed into a mount. The poem was a direct inspiration for John Keats famous poem La Belle Dame Sans Merci. Coleridges early intellectual debts besides German idealists like Kant and critics like Lessing were first to William Godwins Political Justice especially during his Pantisocratic period and to David Hartleys Observations on Man which is the source of the psychology which is found in Frost at Midnight. Hartley argued that one becomes aware of sensory events as impressions and that ideas are derived by noticing similarities and differences between impressions and then by naming them. Connections resulting from the coincidence of impressions create linkages so that the occurrence of one impression triggers those links and calls up the memory of those ideas with which it is associated . Coleridge was critical of the literary taste of his contemporaries and a literary conservative insofar as he was afraid that the lack of taste in the ever growing masses of literate people would mean a continued desecration of literature. In 1800 he returned to England and shortly thereafter settled with his family and friends in Greta Hall at Keswick in the Lake District of Cumberland to be near Grasmere where Wordsworth had moved. He stayed with the Wordsworths for eighteen months but was a difficult houseguest as his dependency on laudanum grew and his frequent nightmares would wake the children. He was also a fussy eater to the frustration of Dorothy Wordsworth who had to cook. For example not content with salt Coleridge sprinkled cayenne pepper on his eggs which he ate from a teacup. His marital problems nightmares illnesses increased opium dependency tensions with Wordsworth and a lack of confidence in his poetic powers fuelled the composition of Dejection An Ode and an intensification of his philosophical studies. In 1802 Coleridge took a nine-day walking holiday in the fells of the Lake District. Coleridge is credited with the first recorded descent of Scafell to Mickledore via Broad Stand although this may have been more due to his getting lost than a purposeful new route. He coined the term mountaineering. In 1804 he travelled to Sicily and Malta working for a time as Acting Public Secretary of Malta under the Civil Commissioner Alexander Ball a task he performed successfully. He lived in San Anton Palace in the village of Attard. He gave this up and returned to England in 1806. Dorothy Wordsworth was shocked at his condition upon his return.  From 1807 to 1808 Coleridge returned to Malta and then travelled in Sicily and Italy in the hope that leaving Britains damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium. Thomas De Quincey alleges in his Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth. It has been suggested that this reflects De Quinceys own experiences more than Coleridges. His opium addiction now began to take over his life he separated from his wife Sara in 1808 quarrelled with Wordsworth in 1810 lost part of his annuity in 1811 and put himself under the care of Dr. Daniel in 1814. His addiction caused severe constipation which required regular and humiliating enemas. In 1809 Coleridge made his second attempt to become a newspaper publisher with the publication of the journal entitled The Friend. It was a weekly publication that in Coleridges typically ambitious style was written edited and published almost entirely single-handedly. Given that Coleridge tended to be highly disorganised and had no head for business the publication was probably doomed from the start. Coleridge financed the journal by selling over five hundred subscriptions over two dozen of which were sold to members of Parliament but in late 1809 publication was crippled by a financial crisis and Coleridge was obliged to approach Conversation Sharp Tom Poole and one or two other wealthy friends for an emergency loan to continue. The Friend was an eclectic publication that drew upon every corner of Coleridges remarkably diverse knowledge of law philosophy morals politics history and literary criticism.  Although it was often turgid rambling and inaccessible to most readers it ran for 25 issues and was republished in book form a number of times. Years after its initial publication a revised and expanded edition of The Friend with added philosophical content including his Essays on the Principles of Method became a highly influential work and its effect was felt on writers and philosophers from John Stuart Mill to Ralph Waldo Emerson. From 1810 to 1820 Coleridge gave a series of lectures in London and Bristol those on Shakespeare renewed interest in the playwright as a model for contemporary writers. Much of Coleridges reputation as a literary critic is founded on the lectures that he undertook in the winter of 181011 which were sponsored by the Philosophical Institution and given at Scots Corporation Hall off Fetter Lane Fleet Street. These lectures were heralded in the prospectus as A Course of Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton in Illustration of the Principles of Poetry. Coleridges ill-health opium-addiction problems and somewhat unstable personality meant that all his lectures were plagued with problems of delays and a general irregularity of quality from one lecture to the next.  As a result of these factors Coleridge often failed to prepare anything but the loosest set of notes for his lectures and regularly entered into extremely long digressions which his audiences found difficult to follow. However it was the lecture on Hamlet given on 2 January 1812 that was considered the best and has influenced Hamlet studies ever since. Before Coleridge Hamlet was often denigrated and belittled by critics from Voltaire to Dr. Johnson. Coleridge rescued the plays reputation and his thoughts on it are often still published as supplements to the text. In 1812 he allowed Robert Southey to make use of extracts from his vast number of private notebooks in their collaboration Omniana; Or Horae Otiosiores. In August 1814 Coleridge was approached by John Murray Lord Byrons publisher about the possibility of translating Goethes classic Faust . Coleridge was regarded by many as the greatest living writer on the demonic and he accepted the commission only to abandon work on it after six weeks. Until recently scholars were in agreement that Coleridge never returned to the project despite Goethes own belief in the 1820s that he had in fact completed a long translation of the work. In September 2007 Oxford University Press sparked a heated scholarly controversy by publishing an English translation of Goethes work that purported to be Coleridges long-lost masterpiece . From 1814 to 1816 Coleridge rented from a local surgeon Mr Page in Calne Wiltshire. He seemed able to focus on his work and manage his addiction drafting Biographia Literaria. A blue plaque marks the property today. In April 1816 Coleridge with his addiction worsening his spirits depressed and his family alienated took residence in the Highgate homes then just north of London of the physician James Gillman first at South Grove and later at the nearby 3 The Grove. It is unclear whether his growing use of opium was a symptom or a cause of his growing depression. Gillman was partially successful in controlling the poets addiction. Coleridge remained in Highgate for the rest of his life and the house became a place of literary pilgrimage for writers including Carlyle and Emerson. In Gillmans home Coleridge finished his major prose work the Biographia Literaria a volume composed of 23 chapters of autobiographical notes and dissertations on various subjects including some incisive literary theory and criticism. He composed a considerable amount of poetry of variable quality. He published other writings while he was living at the Gillman homes notably the Lay Sermons of 1816 and 1817 Sibylline Leaves Hush Aids to Reflection and On the Constitution of the Church and State . He also produced essays published shortly after his death such as Essay on Faith and Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit . A number of his followers were central to the Oxford Movement and his religious writings profoundly shaped Anglicanism in the mid-nineteenth century. Coleridge also worked extensively on the various manuscripts which form his Opus Maximum a work which was in part intended as a post-Kantian work of philosophical synthesis. The work was never published in his lifetime and has frequently been seen as evidence for his tendency to conceive grand projects which he then had difficulty in carrying through to completion. But while he frequently berated himself for his indolence the long list of his published works calls this myth into question. Critics are divided on whether the Opus Maximum first published in 2002 successfully resolved the philosophical issues he had been exploring for most of his adult life. Faith may be defined as fidelity to our own being so far as such being is not and cannot become an object of the senses; and hence by clear inference or implication to being generally as far as the same is not the object of the senses; and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the condition or concomitant or consequence of the same. This will be best explained by an instance or example. That I am conscious of something within me peremptorily commanding me to do unto others as I would they should do unto me; in other words a categorical imperative; that the maxim of my actions both inward and outward should be such as I could without any contradiction arising therefrom will to be the law of all moral and rational beings. Essay on Faith Carlyle described him at Highgate Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill in those years looking down on London and its smoke-tumult like a sage escaped from the inanity of lifes battle...The practical intellects of the world did not much heed him or carelessly reckoned him a metaphysical dreamer but to the rising spirits of the young generation he had this dusky sublime character; and sat there as a kind of Magus girt in mystery and enigma; his Dodona oak-grove whispering strange things uncertain whether oracles or jargon. Coleridge is buried in the aisle of St. Michaels Parish Church in Highgate London. He was originally buried at Old Highgate Chapel next to the main entrance of Highgate School but was re-interred in St. Michaels in 1961. Coleridge could see the red door of the then new church from his last residence across the green where he lived with a doctor he had hoped might cure him . When it was discovered Coleridges vault had become derelict the coffins Coleridges and those of his wife daughter son-in-law and grandsonwere moved to St. Michaels after an international fundraising appeal. Drew Clode a member of St. Michaels stewardship committee states They put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure and quite suitable bricked them up and forgot about them. A recent excavation revealed the coffins were not in the location most believed the far corner of the crypt but actually below a memorial slab in the nave inscribed with Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. St. Michaels plans to restore the crypt and allow public access. Says vicar Kunle Ayodeji of the plans ...we hope that the whole crypt can be cleared as a space for meetings and other uses which would also allow access to Coleridges cellar. Coleridge is one of the most important figures in English poetry. His poems directly and deeply influenced all the major poets of the age. He was known by his contemporaries as a meticulous craftsman who was more rigorous in his careful reworking of his poems than any other poet and Southey and Wordsworth were dependent on his professional advice. His influence on Wordsworth is particularly important because many critics have credited Coleridge with the very idea of Conversational Poetry. The idea of utilising common everyday language to express profound poetic images and ideas for which Wordsworth became so famous may have originated almost entirely in Coleridges mind. It is difficult to imagine Wordsworths great poems The Excursion or The Prelude ever having been written without the direct influence of Coleridges originality. As important as Coleridge was to poetry as a poet he was equally important to poetry as a critic. His philosophy of poetry which he developed over many years has been deeply influential in the field of literary criticism. This influence can be seen in such critics as A. O. Lovejoy and I. A. Richards. Coleridge is arguably best known for his longer poems particularly The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel. Even those who have never read the Rime have come under its influence its words have given the English language the metaphor of an albatross around ones neck the quotation of water water everywhere nor any drop to drink and the phrase a sadder and a wiser man . The phrase All creatures great and small may have been inspired by The Rime He prayeth best who loveth best; All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us; He made and loveth all. Millions more who have never read the poem nonetheless know its story thanks to the 1984 song Rime of the Ancient Mariner by the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Christabel is known for its musical rhythm language and its Gothic tale. Kubla Khan or A Vision in a Dream A Fragment although shorter is also widely known. Both Kubla Khan and Christabel have an additional Romantic aura because they were never finished. Stopford Brooke characterised both poems as having no rival due to their exquisite metrical movement and imaginative phrasing. The eight of Coleridges poems listed above are now often discussed as a group entitled Conversation poems. The term was coined in 1928 by George McLean Harper who borrowed the subtitle of The Nightingale A Conversation Poem to describe the seven other poems as well. The poems are considered by many critics to be among Coleridges finest verses; thus Harold Bloom has written With Dejection The Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan Frost at Midnight shows Coleridge at his most impressive. They are also among his most influential poems as discussed further below. Harper considered that the eight poems represented a form of blank verse that is ...more fluent and easy than Miltons or any that had been written since Milton. In 2006 Robert Koelzer wrote about another aspect of this apparent easiness noting that Conversation poems such as Coleridges The Eolian Harp and The Nightingale maintain a middle register of speech employing an idiomatic language that is capable of being construed as un-symbolic and un-musical language that lets itself be taken as merely talk rather than rapturous song. The last ten lines of Frost at Midnight were chosen by Harper as the best example of the peculiar kind of blank verse Coleridge had evolved as natural-seeming as prose but as exquisitely artistic as the most complicated sonnet. The speaker of the poem is addressing his infant son asleep by his side Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to theeWhether the summer clothe the general earthWith greenness or the redbreast sit and singBetwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branchOf mossy apple-tree while the nigh thatchSmokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fallHeard only in the trances of the blastOr if the secret ministry of frostShall hang them up in silent iciclesQuietly shining to the quiet Moon. In 1965 M. H. Abrams wrote a broad description that applies to the Conversation poems The speaker begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory thought anticipation and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight faces up to a tragic loss comes to a moral decision or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began at the outer scene but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation. In fact Abrams was describing both the Conversation poems and later poems influenced by them. Abrams essay has been called a touchstone of literary criticism. As Paul Magnuson described it in 2002 Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the greater Romantic lyric a genre that began with Coleridges Conversation poems and included Wordsworths Tintern Abbey Shelleys Stanzas Written in Dejection and Keatss Ode to a Nightingale and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold Walt Whitman Wallace Stevens and W. H. Auden. In addition to his poetry Coleridge also wrote influential pieces of literary criticism including Biographia Literaria a collection of his thoughts and opinions on literature which he published in 1817. The work delivered both biographical explanations of the authors life as well as his impressions on literature. The collection also contained an analysis of a broad range of philosophical principles of literature ranging from Aristotle to Immanuel Kant and Schelling and applied them to the poetry of peers such as William Wordsworth. Coleridges explanation of metaphysical principles were popular topics of discourse in academic communities throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and T.S. Eliot stated that he believed that Coleridge was perhaps the greatest of English critics and in a sense the last. Eliot suggests that Coleridge displayed natural abilities far greater than his contemporaries dissecting literature and applying philosophical principles of metaphysics in a way that brought the subject of his criticisms away from the text and into a world of logical analysis that mixed logical analysis and emotion. However Eliot also criticises Coleridge for allowing his emotion to play a role in the metaphysical process believing that critics should not have emotions that are not provoked by the work being studied.Hugh Kenner in Historical Fictions discusses Norman Frumans Coleridge the Damaged Archangel and suggests that the term criticism is too often applied to Biographia Literaria which both he and Fruman describe as having failed to explain or help the reader understand works of art. To Kenner Coleridges attempt to discuss complex philosophical concepts without describing the rational process behind them displays a lack of critical thinking that makes the volume more of a biography than a work of criticism. In Biographia Literaria and his poetry symbols are not merely objective correlatives to Coleridge but instruments for making the universe and personal experience intelligible and spiritually covalent. To Coleridge the cinque spotted spider making its way upstream by fits and starts is not merely a comment on the intermittent nature of creativity imagination or spiritual progress but the journey and destination of his life. The spiders five legs represent the central problem that Coleridge lived to resolve the conflict between Aristotelian logic and Christian philosophy. Two legs of the spider represent the me-not me of thesis and antithesis the idea that a thing cannot be itself and its opposite simultaneously the basis of the clockwork Newtonian world view that Coleridge rejected. The remaining three legsexothesis mesothesis and synthesis or the Holy trinityrepresent the idea that things can diverge without being contradictory. Taken together the five legswith synthesis in the center form the Holy Cross of Ramist logic. The cinque-spotted spider is Coleridges emblem of holism the quest and substance of Coleridges thought and spiritual life. Coleridge wrote reviews of Ann Radcliffes books and The Mad Monk among others. He comments in his reviews Situations of torment and images of naked horror are easily conceived; and a writer in whose works they abound deserves our gratitude almost equally with him who should drag us by way of sport through a military hospital or force us to sit at the dissecting-table of a natural philosopher. To trace the nice boundaries beyond which terror and sympathy are deserted by the pleasurable emotions to reach those limits yet never to pass them hic labor hic opus est. and The horrible and the preternatural have usually seized on the popular taste at the rise and decline of literature. Most powerful stimulants they can never be required except by the torpor of an unawakened or the languor of an exhausted appetite...We trust however that satiety will banish what good sense should have prevented; and that wearied with fiends incomprehensible characters with shrieks murders and subterraneous dungeons the public will learn by the multitude of the manufacturers with how little expense of thought or imagination this species of composition is manufactured. However Coleridge used these elements in poems such as The Rime of the Ancient Mariner Christabel and Kubla Khan and certainly influenced other poets and writers of the time. Poems like these both drew inspiration from and helped to inflame the craze for Gothic romance. Coleridge also made considerable use of Gothic elements in his commercially successful play Remorse. Mary Shelley who knew Coleridge well mentions The Rime of the Ancient Mariner twice directly in Frankenstein and some of the descriptions in the novel echo it indirectly. Although William Godwin her father disagreed with Coleridge on some important issues he respected his opinions and Coleridge often visited the Godwins. Mary Shelley later recalled hiding behind the sofa and hearing his voice chanting The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. C. S. Lewis also makes mention of his name in The Screwtape Letters . His father was an Anglican vicar and though Coleridge worked as a Unitarian preacher from 1796 to 1797 he eventually returned to the Church of England in 1814. His most noteworthy writings on religion are Lay Sermons Aids to Reflection and The Constitution of Church and State . Despite being mostly remembered today for his poetry and literary criticism Coleridge was also a theologian. His writings include discussions of the status of scripture the doctrines of the Fall justification and sanctification and the personality and infinity of God. A major figure in the Anglican theology of his day his writings are still regularly referred to by contemporary Anglican theologians. F. D. Maurice F. J. A. Hort F. W. Robertson B. F. Westcott John Oman and Thomas Erskine were all influenced by him. Coleridge was also a political thinker. Early in life he was a political radical and an enthusiast for the French Revolution. However he subsequently developed a more conservative view of society somewhat in the manner of Edmund Burke. He was critical of the French Constitution of 1799 adopted following the Coup of 18 Brumaire which he regarded as oligarchic. Although seen as cowardly treachery by the next generation of Romantic poets Coleridges later thought became a fruitful source for the evolving radicalism of J. S. Mill. Mill found three aspects of Coleridges thought especially illuminating The current standard edition is The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge edited by Kathleen Coburn and many others from 1969 to 2002. This collection appeared across 16 volumes as Bollingen Series 75 published variously by Princeton University Press and Routledge Kegan Paul. The set is broken down as follows into further parts resulting in a total of 34 separate printed volumes In addition Coleridges letters are available in The Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge ed. Earl Leslie Griggs 6 vols. .
Ann Radcliffe,Ann Radcliffe was an English novelist and a pioneer of Gothic fiction. Her technique of explaining apparently supernatural elements in her novels has been credited with gaining respectability for Gothic fiction in the 1790s. Radcliffe was the most popular writer of her day and almost universally admired; contemporary critics called her the mighty enchantress and the Shakespeare of romance-writers and her popularity continued through the 19th century. Interest has revived in the early 21st century with the publication of three biographies. Radcliffe was born Ann Ward in Holborn London on 9 July 1764. She was the only child to William Ward and Ann Oates and her mother was 36 years old when she gave birth. Her father worked as a haberdasher in London before moving the family to Bath in 1772 to take over management of a porcelain shop for his business partners Thomas Bentley and Josiah Wedgwood. Both of her parents were relatively well connected. Her father had a famous uncle William Cheselden who was Surgeon to King George II and her mother descended from the De Witt family of Holland and had a cousin Sir Richard Jebb who was a fashionable London physician. Growing up Radcliffe often visited her maternal uncle Thomas Bentley in Chelsea London and later Turnham Green. Bentley was business partners with a fellow Unitarian Josiah Wedgwood maker of the Wedgwood China. Sukey Wedgwoods daughter also stayed in Chelsea and is Radcliffes only known childhood companion. Sukey later married Dr. Robert Darwin and had a son the naturalist Charles Darwin. Although mixing in some distinguished circles Radcliffe seems to have made little impression in this society and was described by Wedgwood as Bentleys shy niece. In 1787 when Ann was 23 years old she married William Radcliffe who was an Oxford-educated journalist. William had initially been a student of law but he didnt complete his legal studies and instead turned his attention to literature and journalism. Ann and William were married in Bath but soon after moved to London where William got a job working for a paper. William wrote for the Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser which was a campaigning newspaper that celebrated the French Revolution freedom of the press and Dissenters rights. Ann and William never had children. By all accounts theirs was a happy marriage. Radcliffe called him her nearest relative and friend. According to Talfourds memoir Ann started writing while her husband remained out late most evenings for work. She published her first novel The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne in 1789 at the age of 25 and she would go on to publish her next four novels in short succession. The money she earned from her novels later allowed her husband to quit his job and the two of them travelled together along with their dog Chance. In 1794 they went to the Netherlands and Germany. This was her only trip abroad and it became the inspiration for a travelog that she published a year later. On this trip Ann and William were actually meant to go on to Switzerland but this plan was frustrated by a disobliging official who refused to believe that they were English and would not honor their passports. In 1795 William returned as editor of the Gazetteer and a year later he purchased the English Chronicle or Universal Evening Post which was a Whig newspaper. Ann published The Italian in 1797 and it would be the last novel published in her lifetime. She was paid 800 for it which was three times her husbands yearly income. In her final years Radcliffe retreated from public life and was rumoured to have gone insane as a result of her writing. These rumours arose because Radcliffe seemingly abandoned writing after publishing her fifth novel and vanished from the public eye. While these rumours were later proven false they were so popular that Talfourds memoir actually included a statement from her physician that spoke about her mental condition in her later years. Radcliffe remained secluded for 26 years with no real explanation available to her many fans. However this supposed seclusion is contradicted in The New Monthly Magazine which states that the tenor of Mrs Radcliffes life was characterized by the rare union of the literary gentlewoman and the active housewife. Instead of being in confinement in Derbyshire as had been asserted she was seen every Sunday at St Jamess Church; almost every fine day in Hyde Park; sometimes at the theatres and very frequently at the Opera. Radcliffe spent the rest of her adult life travelling and living a comfortable life with her husband and their dog Chance. They travelled domestically almost once a year from 1797 to 1811 and in later years when they had stopped doing distant excursions Ann and William would hire a carriage during the summer months so that they could make trips to places near London. Radcliffe did continue to write. She wrote poetry and another novel Gaston de Blondeville but this novel was not published until after her lifetime. She was said to have suffered from asthma for which she received regular treatment. In 1823 Radcliffe went to Ramsgate but it was here that she caught a chest infection which caused her death. She died 7 February 1823 at the age of 58 and was buried in a vault in the Chapel of Ease at St Georges Hanover Square London. Although she had suffered from asthma for twelve years previously her modern biographer Rictor Norton cites the description given by her physician Dr. Scudamore of how a new inflammation seized the membranes of the brain which led to violent symptoms and argues that they suggest a bronchial infection leading to pneumonia high fever delirium and death. Shortly after her death Gaston de Blondeville was published by Henry Colburn featuring A Memoir for the Authoress the first known biographical piece on Radcliffe. It also contained some of her poetry and her essay On the Supernatural in Poetry which outlines her distinction between terror and horror. Christina Rossetti attempted to write a biography of Radcliffe in 1883 but abandoned it for lack of information. For 50 years biographers stayed away from her as a subject agreeing with Rossettis estimation. Rictor Norton author of Mistress of Udolpho The Life of Ann Radcliffe argues that those 50 years were dominated by interpretation rather than scholarship where information was repeated rather than traced to a reliable source. Radcliffe published five novels during her lifetime which she always referred to as romances. Her first novel The Castles of Athlin and Dubnayne was published anonymously in 1789. Early reviewers were mostly unenthusiastic about it. The Monthly Review said that while the novel was commendable for its morality it appealed only to women and children To men who have passed or even attained the meridian of life a series of events which seem not to have their foundation in nature will ever be insipid if not disgustful. It was also largely criticized for its anachronisms and inauthentic renderings of the Highlands. One year later Radcliffe published her second novel A Sicilian Romance which also received little attention. In 1791 she published her third novel The Romance of the Forest. Like her first two novels this book was initially published anonymously. On the original title page it stated that the novel was By the Authoress of A Sicilian Romance.The Romance of the Forest was popular with readers and in the second edition Radcliffe began adding her own name to the title page. In 1794 three years later Radcliffe published The Mysteries of Udolpho. At a time when the average amount earned by an author for a manuscript was 10 her publishers G. G. and J. Robinson bought the copyright for this novel for 500 and it was a runaway success. The money from this novel allowed her and her husband to travel to the Netherlands and Germany which she described in her travelogue A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794 . She published The Italian in 1797 and it was the last novel published in her lifetime. Cadell and Davies paid 800 making Radcliffe the highest-paid professional writer of the 1790s. This novel was written in response to Matthew Gregory Lewiss The Monk because Radcliffe did not like the direction in which Gothic literature was heading. One critic Nick Groom writes that in The Italian Radcliffe takes the violence and eroticism that so titillated readers of The Monk and subsumes them beneath the veil and the cowl of oppressive Catholicism. A final novel Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This novel was published with Talfourds memoir and Radcliffes unfinished essay On the Supernatural in Poetry which details the difference between the sensation of terror her works aimed to achieve and the horror Lewis sought to evoke. Radcliffe stated that terror aims to stimulate readers through imagination and perceived evils while horror closes them off through fear and physical dangers Terror and Horror are so far opposite that the first expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life; the other contracts freezes and nearly annihilates them. Radcliffe portrayed her female characters as equal to male characters allowing them to dominate and overtake the typically powerful male villains and heroes creating new roles for women in literature previously not available. Radcliffe was also known for including supernatural elements but eventually giving readers a rational explanation for the supernatural. Usually Radcliffe would reveal the logical excuse for what first appeared to be supernatural towards the end of her novels which led to heightened suspense. Some criticsreaders found this disappointing and felt duped. Perhaps the most eloquent complaint against the trope was penned by Walter Scott in his Lives of the Novelists . Regarding Radcliffes penchant for explaining the supernatural he writes A stealthy step behind the arras may doubtless in some situations and when the nerves are tuned to a certain pitch have no small influence upon the imagination; but if the conscious listener discovers it to be only the noise made by the cat the solemnity of the feeling is gone and the visionary is at once angry with his sense for having been cheated and with his reason for having acquiesced in the deception. Some modern critics have been frustrated by her work as she fails to include real ghosts. This could be motivated by the idea that works in the Romantic period from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century had to undermine Enlightenment values such as rationalism and realism. Radcliffes work have been considered by some scholars to be part of a larger tradition of anti-Catholicism within Gothic literature; her works contain hostile portrayals of both Catholicism and Catholics.The Italian frequently presents Catholicism the largest religion in Italy in a negative light. In the novel Radcliffe portrays Catholic elements such as the Inquisition in a negative light pointing to its discriminatory practises against non-Catholics. Radcliffe also portrays the confessional as a danger zone controlled by the power of the priest and the church.The Mysteries of Udolpho also contained negative portrayals of Catholicism; both novels are set in Catholic-majority Italy and Catholicism was presented as being part of ancient Italianess. Italy along with its Catholicism had been featured in earlier Gothic literature; Horace Walpoles novel The Castle of Otranto claimed in-universe that it was found in the library of an ancient catholic family in the north of England and printed at Naples in the black letter in the year 1529. Some scholars have suggested that Radcliffes anti-Catholicism was partly a response to the 1791 Roman Catholic Relief Act passed by the British parliament which was a major component of Catholic emancipation in Great Britain. Other scholars have suggested that Radcliffe was ultimately ambivalent towards Catholicism claiming that she was a Latitudinarian. Radcliffe used the framing narrative of personifying nature in many of her novels. For example she believed that the sublime motivated the protagonist to create an image that was more idealistic within the plot. Her elaborate descriptions of landscape were influenced by the painters Claude Lorrain Nicolas Poussin and Salvator Rosa. She often wrote about places she had never visited. Lorrains influence can be seen through Radcliffes picturesque romantic descriptions for example in the first volume of The Mysteries of Udolpho. Rosas influence can be seen through dark landscapes and elements of the Gothic. In a shaded corner near the chimney a most exquisite Claude an evening view perhaps over the Campagna of Rome. The sight of this picture imparted much of the luxurious repose and satisfaction which we derive from contemplating the finest scenes of nature. Here was the poet as well as the painter touching the imagination and making you see more than the picture contained. You saw the real light of the sun you breathed the air of the country you felt all the circumstances of a luxurious climate on the most serene and beautiful landscape; and the mind thus softened you almost fancied you hear Italian music in the air. Radcliffe influenced many later authors both by inspiring more Gothic fiction and by inspiring parodies. In the eighteenth century she inspired writers like Matthew Lewis and the Marquis de Sade who praised her work but produced more intensely violent fiction. Radcliffe is known for having spawned a large number of lesser imitators of the Radcliffe School such as Harriet Lee and Catherine Cuthbertson. Jane Austen parodied The Mysteries of Udolpho in Northanger Abbey and she defined her fiction as a contrast to Radcliffe and writers like her. Scholars have also perceived other apparent allusions to Radcliffes novels and life in Austens work. In the early nineteenth century Radcliffe influenced Edgar Allan Poe and Sir Walter Scott . For example Scott interspersed his work with poems in a similar manner to Radcliffe and one assessment of her reads Scott himself said that her prose was poetry and her poetry was prose. She was indeed a prose poet in both the best and the worst senses of the phrase. The romantic landscape the background is the best thing in all her books; the characters are two dimensional the plots far fetched and improbable with elaboration of means and futility of result. Later in the nineteenth century Charlotte and Emily Brontë continued Radcliffes Gothic tradition with their novels Jane Eyre Villette and Wuthering Heights. Radcliffe was also admired by French authors like Honoré de Balzac Victor Hugo Alexandre Dumas and Charles Baudelaire .Honoré de Balzacs novel of the supernatural LHéritière de Birague follows the tradition of Radcliffes style and parodies it. As a child the young Fyodor Dostoyevsky was deeply impressed by Radcliffe. In Winter Notes on Summer Impressions he writes I used to spend the long winter hours before bed listening agape with ecstasy and terror as my parents read aloud to me from the novels of Ann Radcliffe. Then I would rave deliriously about them in my sleep. A number of scholars have noted elements of Gothic literature in Dostoyevskys novels and some have tried to show direct influence of Radcliffes work. In 1875 Paul Féval wrote a story starring Radcliffe as a vampire hunter titled La Ville Vampire Adventure Incroyable de Madame Anne Radcliffe which blends fiction and history. At the last minute a mysterious man on a white horse saves the day none other than Lord Wellington fresh from the Battle of Waterloo. Helen McCrory plays Ann Radcliffe in the 2007 film Becoming Jane starring Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen. The film depicts Radcliffe as meeting the young Jane Austen and encouraging her to pursue a literary career. No evidence exists that such a meeting ever occurred.
Jane Austen,Jane Austen was an English novelist known primarily for her six novels which implicitly interpret critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austens plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage for the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works are an implicit critique of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her deft use of social commentary realism and biting irony have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars. The anonymously published Sense and Sensibility Pride and Prejudice Mansfield Park and Emma were a modest success but brought her little fame in her lifetime. She wrote two other novelsNorthanger Abbey and Persuasion both published posthumously in 1818and began another eventually titled Sanditon but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript the short epistolary novel Lady Susan and the unfinished novel The Watsons. Since her death Austens novels have rarely been out of print. A significant transition in her reputation occurred in 1833 when they were republished in Richard Bentleys Standard Novels series . They gradually gained wide acclaim and popular readership. In 1869 fifty-two years after her death her nephews publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience. Her work has inspired a large number of critical essays and has been included in many literary anthologies. Her novels have also inspired many films including 1940s Pride and Prejudice 1995s Sense and Sensibility and 2016s Love Friendship. The scant biographical information about Austen comes from her few surviving letters and sketches her family members wrote about her. Only about 160 of the approximately 3000 letters Austen wrote have survived and been published. Cassandra Austen destroyed the bulk of the letters she received from her sister burning or otherwise destroying them. She wanted to ensure that the younger nieces did not read any of Janes sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members. In the interest of protecting reputations from Janes penchant for honesty and forthrightness Cassandra omitted details of illnesses unhappiness and anything she considered unsavory. Important details about the Austen family were elided by intention such as any mention of Austens brother George whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot arrested and tried on charges of larceny. The first Austen biography was Henry Thomas Austens 1818 Biographical Notice. It appeared in a posthumous edition of Northanger Abbey and included extracts from two letters against the judgement of other family members. Details of Austens life continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephews A Memoir of Jane Austen published in 1869 and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leighs biography Jane Austen Her Life and Letters published in 1913 all of which included additional letters. Austens family and relatives built a legend of good quiet Aunt Jane portraying her as a woman in a happy domestic situation whose family was the mainstay of her life. Modern biographers include details excised from the letters and family biographies but the biographer Jan Fergus writes that the challenge is to keep the view balanced not to present her languishing in periods of deep unhappiness as an embittered disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family. Jane Austen was born in Steventon Hampshire on 16 December 1775 in a harsh winter. Her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago. He added that the newborn infant was a present plaything for Cassy and a future companion. The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane. George Austen served as the rector of the Anglican parishes of Steventon and Deane. The Reverend Austen came from an old and wealthy family of wool merchants. As each generation of eldest sons received inheritances the wealth was divided and Georges branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. In 1745 at the age of fifteen George Austens sister Philadelphia was apprenticed to a milliner in Covent Garden. At the age of sixteen George entered St Johns College Oxford where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh . She came from the prominent Leigh family; her father was rector at All Souls College Oxford where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot. George Austen and Cassandra Leigh were engaged probably around 1763 when they exchanged miniatures. He received the living of the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin Thomas Knight. They married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithins Church in Bath by license in a simple ceremony two months after Cassandras father died. Their income was modest with Georges small per annum living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mothers death. The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon a 16th-century house in disrepair underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane James in 1765 George in 1766 and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then place it with Elizabeth Littlewood a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months. In 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures may have been deaf and mute and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773 Cassandra was born followed by Francis in 1774 and Jane in 1775. According to Professor of Literature Park Honan the atmosphere of the Austen home was an open amused easy intellectual one where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed. The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Mrs Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with Georges sister Philadelphia and her daughter Eliza accompanied by his other sister Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were according to Le Faye the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times all helped to widen Janes youthful horizon and influence her later life and works. Cassandra Austens cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents upon her return ...and almost home they were when they met Jane Charles the two little ones of the family who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise have the pleasure of riding home in it. Le Faye writes that Mr Austens predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand and between Henry and Jane on the other. From 1773 until 1796 George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time who boarded at his home. The Reverend Austen had an annual income of 200 from his two livings. This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about 100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between 1000 and 5000. Mr. Austen also rented the 200-acre Cheesedown farm from his benefactor Thomas Knight which could make a profit of 300 a year. During this period of her life Jane Austen attended church regularly socialised with friends and neighbours and read novelsoften of her own compositionaloud to her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing either impromptu in someones home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall. Her brother Henry later said that Jane was fond of dancing and excelled in it. In 1783 Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them to Southampton later that year. That autumn both girls were sent home after catching typhus from which Jane Austen nearly died. She was from then home educated until she attended boarding school with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls School ruled by Mrs La Tournelle. The curriculum probably included French spelling needlework dancing music and drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. After 1786 Austen never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment. Her education came from reading guided by her father and brothers James and Henry.Irene Collins said that Austen used some of the same school books as the boys. Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her fathers library and that of a family friend Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austens sometimes risqué experiments in writing and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing. Private theatricals were an essential part of Austens education. From her early childhood the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn including Richard Sheridans The Rivals and David Garricks Bon Ton. Austens eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies which suggests how Austens satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12 she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years. From at least the time she was aged eleven Austen wrote poems and stories to amuse herself and her family. She exaggerated mundane details of daily life and parodied common plot devices in stories full of anarchic fantasies of female power licence illicit behaviour and general high spirits according to Janet Todd. Containing work written between 1787 and 1793 Austen compiled fair copies of twenty-nine early works into three bound notebooks now referred to as the Juvenilia. She called the three notebooks Volume the First Volume the Second and Volume the Third and they preserve 90000 words she wrote during those years. The Juvenilia are often according to scholar Richard Jenkyns boisterous and anarchic; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne. Among these works is a satirical novel in letters titled Love and Freindship written when aged fourteen in 1790 in which she mocked popular novels of sensibility. The next year she wrote The History of England a manuscript of thirty-four pages accompanied by thirteen watercolour miniatures by her sister Cassandra. Austens History parodied popular historical writing particularly Oliver Goldsmiths History of England . Honan speculates that not long after writing Love and Freindship Austen decided to write for profit to make stories her central effort that is to become a professional writer. When she was around eighteen years old Austen began to write longer more sophisticated works. In August 1792 aged seventeen Austen started Catharine or the Bower which presaged her mature work especially Northanger Abbey but was left unfinished until picked up in Lady Susan which Todd describes as less prefiguring than Catharine. A year later she began but abandoned a short play later titled Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man a comedy in 6 acts which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austens favourite contemporary novel The History of Sir Charles Grandison by Samuel Richardson. When Austen became an aunt for the first time aged eighteen she sent new-born niece Fanny-Catherine Austen-Knight five short pieces of ... the Juvenilia now known collectively as Scraps .. purporting to be her Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women. For Jane-Anna-Elizabeth Austen her aunt wrote two more Miscellanious on 2 June 1793 convinced that if you seriously attend to them You will derive from them very important Instructions with regard to your Conduct in Life. There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1811 and that her niece and nephew Anna and James Edward Austen made further additions as late as 1814. Between 1793 and 1795 Austen wrote Lady Susan a short epistolary novel usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work. It is unlike any of Austens other works. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novellas heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate betray and abuse her lovers friends and family. Tomalin writes Told in letters it is as neatly plotted as a play and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration... It stands alone in Austens work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters. According to Janet Todd the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Elizas French husband was guillotined in 1794; she married Janes brother Henry Austen in 1797. When Austen was twenty Tom Lefroy a neighbour visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering and it is clear from Austens letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. Austen wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a very gentlemanlike good-looking pleasant young man. Five days later in another letter Austen wrote that she expected an offer from her friend and that I shall refuse him however unless he promises to give away his white coat going on to write I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy for whom I dont give a sixpence and refuse all others. The next day Austen wrote The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea. Halperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire he was carefully kept away from the Austens and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798 Lefroy was still on Austens mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives wanted desperately to ask about him but could not bring herself to raise the subject. After finishing Lady Susan Austen began her first full-length novel Elinor and Marianne. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family before 1796 and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as Sense and Sensibility. Austen began a second novel First Impressions in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797 aged 21; as with all of her novels Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an established favourite. At this time her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797 George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell an established publisher in London to ask if he would consider publishing First Impressions. Cadell returned Mr. Austens letter marking it Declined by Return of Post. Austen may not have known of her fathers efforts. Following the completion of First Impressions Austen returned to Elinor and Marianne and from November 1797 until mid-1798 revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to Sense and Sensibility. In 1797 Austen met her cousin Eliza de Feuillide a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feuillide had been guillotined causing her to flee to Britain where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feuillide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life. During the middle of 1798 after finishing revisions of Elinor and Marianne Austen began writing a third novel with the working title Susanlater Northanger Abbeya satire on the popular Gothic novel. Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803 Henry Austen offered Susan to Benjamin Crosby a London publisher who paid 10 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being in the press but did nothing more. The manuscript remained in Crosbys hands unpublished until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816. In December 1800 George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry leave Steventon and move the family to 4 Sydney Place in Bath Somerset. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving 50 miles away from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived in Bath. She was able to make some revisions to Susan and she began and then abandoned a new novel The Watsons but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 17951799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer but Honan disagrees arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life except for a few months after her father died. It is often claimed that Austen was unhappy in Bath which caused her to lose interest in writing but it is just as possible that Austens social life in Bath prevented her from spending much time writing novels. The critic Robert Irvine argued that if Austen spent more time writing novels when she was in the countryside it might just have been because she had more spare time as opposed to being more happy in the countryside as is often argued. Furthermore Austen frequently both moved and travelled over southern England during this period which was hardly a conducive environment for writing a long novel. Austen sold the rights to publish Susan to a publisher Crosby Company who paid her 10 . The Crosby Company advertised Susan but never published it. The years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother Harris Bigg-Wither had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen Janes niece and Reginald Bigg-Wither a descendant Harris was not attractivehe was a large plain-looking man who spoke little stuttered when he did speak was aggressive in conversation and almost completely tactless. However Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age give Cassandra a permanent home and perhaps assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. Irvine described Bigg-Wither as somebody who ...seems to have been a man very hard to like let alone love. In 1814 Austen wrote a letter to her niece Fanny Knight who had asked for advice about a serious relationship telling her that having written so much on one side of the question I shall now turn around entreat you not to commit yourself farther not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection. The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity the meaning of ardent love. A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates the worse and most irremediable of all evils a connection for life with an unsuitable man. In 1804 while living in Bath Austen started but did not complete her novel The Watsons. The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent womens lives. Honan suggests and Tomalin agrees that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort. Her fathers relatively sudden death left Jane Cassandra and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward James Henry and Francis Austen pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters. For the next four years the familys living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing on the Sussex coast where they resided at Stanford Cottage. It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of Lady Susan and added its Conclusion. In 1806 the family moved to Southampton where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family. On 5 April 1809 about three months before the familys move to Chawton Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby offering him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time or at all and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the 10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time but was able to purchase it in 1816. Around early 1809 Austens brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled lifethe use of a large cottage in Chawton village which was part of the estate around Edwards nearby property Chawton House. Jane Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the familys move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the familys life in Chawton as a very quiet life according to our ideas but they were great readers and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write. Like many women authors at the time Austen published her books anonymously. At the time the ideal roles for a woman were as wife and mother and writing for women was regarded at best as a secondary form of activity; a woman who wished to be a full-time writer was felt to be degrading her femininity so books by women were usually published anonymously in order to maintain the conceit that the female writer was only publishing as a sort of part-time job and was not seeking to become a literary lioness . During her time at Chawton Austen published four generally well-received novels. Through her brother Henry the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish Sense and Sensibility which like all of Austens novels except Pride and Prejudice was published on commission that is at the authors financial risk. When publishing on commission publishers would advance the costs of publication repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10 commission for each book sold paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales the author was responsible for them. The alternative to selling via commission was by selling the copyright where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript which occurred with Pride and Prejudice. Austens experience with Susan where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby Sons for 10 who did not publish the book forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published left Austen leery of this method of publishing. The final alternative of selling by subscription where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends could sell by subscription.Sense and Sensibility appeared in October 1811 and was described as being written By a Lady. As it was sold on commission Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings . Reviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austens novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or fewer to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austens novels were published in larger editions ranging from about 750 copies of Sense and Sensibility to about 2000 copies of Emma. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austens novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austens books were originally published on commission the risks of overproduction were largely hers and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger. Austen made 140 from Sense and Sensibility which provided her with some financial and psychological independence. After the success of Sense and Sensibility all of Austens subsequent books were billed as written By the author of Sense and Sensibility and Austens name never appeared on her books during her lifetime. Egerton then published Pride and Prejudice a revision of First Impressions in January 1813. Austen sold the copyright to Pride and Prejudice to Egerton for 110 . To maximise profits he used cheap paper and set the price at 18 shillings . He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. Had Austen sold Pride and Prejudice on commission she would have made a profit of 475 or twice her fathers annual income. By October 1813 Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition.Mansfield Park was published by Egerton in May 1814. While Mansfield Park was ignored by reviewers it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months and Austens earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels. Without Austens knowledge or approval her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented in 1953 that given the prevailing rage in France at the time for lush romantic fantasies it was remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. King cautioned that Austens chief translator in France Madame Isabelle de Montolieu had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English and her translations were more of imitations than translations proper as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austens plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France when Persuasion was published in 1821 as La Famille Elliot ou LAncienne Inclination. Austen learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815 the Prince Regents librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Princes London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming Emma to the Prince. Though Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent she could scarcely refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising gambling drinking spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour. She later wrote Plan of a Novel according to Hints from Various Quarters a satiric outline of the perfect novel based on the librarians many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarkes often pompous literary advice and the Plan of a Novel parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all of the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian. In mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray a better known London publisher who published Emma in December 1815 and a second edition of Mansfield Park in February 1816. Emma sold well but the new edition of Mansfield Park did poorly and this failure offset most of the income from Emma. These were the last of Austens novels to be published during her lifetime. While Murray prepared Emma for publication Austen began The Elliots later published as Persuasion. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition shortly after the publication of Emma Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austens bank failed in March 1816 depriving him of all of his assets leaving him deeply in debt and costing Edward James and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters. Austen was feeling unwell by early 1816 but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year her decline was unmistakable and she began a slow irregular deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Zachary Copes 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addisons disease although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkins lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife effectively disinheriting his relatives she suffered a relapse writing I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncles Will brought on a relapse... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves. Austen continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of The Elliots she rewrote the final two chapters which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began The Brothers completing twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817 probably due to illness. Todd describes Sanditons heroine Diana Parker as an energetic invalid. In the novel Austen mocked hypochondriacs and although she describes the heroine as bilious five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning every wrong colour and living chiefly on the sofa. She put down her pen on 18March 1817 making a note of it. Austen made light of her condition describing it as bile and rheumatism. As her illness progressed she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death. Austen died in Winchester on 18July 1817 at the age of 41. Henry through his clerical connections arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austens personal qualities expresses hope for her salvation and mentions the extraordinary endowments of her mind but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer. In the months after Austens death in July 1817 Cassandra Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey as a set. Henry Austen contributed a Biographical Note dated December 1817 which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as a loving and polished eulogy. Sales were good for a yearonly 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818. Although Austens six novels were out of print in England in the 1820s they were still being read through copies housed in private libraries and circulating libraries. Austen had early admirers. The first piece of fiction using her as a character appeared in 1823 in a letter to the editor in The Ladys Magazine. It refers to Austens genius and suggests that aspiring authors were envious of her powers. In 1832 Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his Standard Novels series. In October 1833 Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then Austens novels have been continuously in print. Austens works implicitly critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. The earliest English novelists Richardson Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Walter Scott Horace Walpole Clara Reeve Ann Radcliffe and Oliver Goldsmith whose style and genre Austen repudiated returning the novel on a slender thread to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a realistic study of manners. In the mid-20th century literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of irony realism and satire to form an author superior to both. Walter Scott noted Austens resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fictionthe ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries. Yet her relationship with these genres is complex as evidenced by Northanger Abbey and Emma. Similar to William Wordsworth who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the Preface to his Lyrical Ballads Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his and she shows that rhetorically less is artistically more. She eschewed popular Gothic fiction stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location a castle or abbey . Yet in Northanger Abbey she alludes to the trope with the heroine Catherine anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody Austen transforms the genre juxtaposing reality with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts against the heroines novel-fueled desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction instead she transforms settings and situations such that the heroine is still imprisoned yet her imprisonment is mundane and realregulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In Sense and Sensibility Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction according to critic Keymer who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress. The hair was curled and the maid sent away and Emma sat down to think and be miserable. It was a wretched business indeed Such an overthrow of everything she had been wishing for Such a development of every thing most unwelcome Richardsons Pamela the prototype for the sentimental novel is a didactic love story with a happy ending written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardsons epistolary style but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speechshe was the first English novelist to do so extensivelythrough which she had the ability to present a characters thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrators voice and values and those of the characters. Austen had a natural ear for speech and dialogue according to scholar Mary Lascelles Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters. Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a characters traits and their tone; syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary is utilised to indicate social variants. Dialogue reveals a characters moodfrustration anger happinesseach treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennet rejects Darcy her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her From the very beginning from the first moment I may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry. Austens plots highlight womens traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century when novels were treated as the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life. Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy is the saving grace of life. Part of Austens fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnsons influence is evident in that she follows his advice to write a representation of life as may excite mirth. Her humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority allowing her most successful characters such as Elizabeth Bennet to transcend the trivialities of life which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of womens lives and gender relations and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life often fusing it with ethical sensibility creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good. As Austens works were published anonymously they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable although superficial and cautious most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott a leading novelist of the day anonymously wrote a review of Emma in 1815 using it to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel and praising Austens realism the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life and presenting to the reader instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However Whately denied having authored the review which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism. Because Austens novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that powerful emotion authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing 19th-century critics and audiences preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. Notwithstanding Walter Scotts positivity Austens work did not match the prevailing aesthetic values of the Romantic zeitgeist. Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold steadily but they were not best-sellers. The first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philarète Chasles in an 1842 essay dismissing her in two sentences as a boring imitative writer with no substance. Austen was almost completely ignored in France until 1878 when the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay Le Roman Classique en Angleterre in which he called Austen a genius the first French author to do so. The first accurate translation of Austen into French occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated Northanger Abbey as Catherine Moreland. In Britain Austen gradually grew in the estimation of the literati. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes published a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. Later in the century novelist Henry James referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare Cervantes and Henry Fielding as among the fine painters of life. The publication of James Edward Austen-Leighs A Memoir of Jane Austen in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as dear aunt Jane the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the Memoir spurred the reissue of Austens novelsthe first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors sets quickly followed. Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as Austenolatry. Around the start of the 20th century an intellectual clique of Janeites reacted against the popularisation of Austen distinguishing their deeper appreciation from the vulgar enthusiasm of the masses. In response Henry James decried a beguiled infatuation with Austen a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austens intrinsic merit and interest. The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the anti-Janites in the 19th and 20th centuries comprised a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain Henry James Charlotte Brontë D. H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis but in every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic leaving Jane Austen relatively untouched. Austens works have attracted legions of scholars. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883 by George Pellew a student at Harvard University. Another early academic analysis came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley who grouped Austens novels into early and late works a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic book devoted to Austen in France was Jane Austen by Paul and Kate Rague who set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year Léonie Villard published Jane Austen Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres originally her PhD thesis the first serious academic study of Austen in France. In 1923 R.W. Chapman published the first scholarly edition of Austens collected works which was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austens works. With the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles Jane Austen and Her Art the academic study of Austen took hold. Lascelles analyzed the books Austen read and their influence on her work and closely examined Austens style and narrative art. Concern arose that academics were obscuring the appreciation of Austen with increasingly esoteric theories a debate that has continued since. The period since World War II has seen a diversity of critical approaches to Austen including feminist theory and perhaps most controversially postcolonial theory. The divide has widened between the popular appreciation of Austen particularly by modern Janeites and academic judgements. In 1994 literary critic Harold Bloom placed Austen among the greatest Western writers of all time. In the Peoples Republic of China after 1949 writings of Austen were regarded as too frivolous and thus during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 196669 Austen was banned as a British bourgeois imperialist. In the late 1970s when Austens works was re-published in China her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people generally read books for enjoyment not political edification. In a typical modern debate the conservative American professor Gene Koppel to the indignation of his liberal literature students mentioned that Austen and her family were Tories of the deepest dye i.e. Conservatives in opposition to the liberal Whigs. Although several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock claimed Austen for their own cause Koppel argued that different people react to a work of literature in different subjective ways as explained by the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. Thus competing interpretations of Austens work can be equally valid provided they are grounded in textual and historical analysis it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency-era society and as a conservative upholding its values. Austens novels have resulted in sequels prequels and adaptations of almost every type from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895 Rosina Filippis Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation The Bennets . The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austens plots characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austens novels starting with the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice class is subtly downplayed and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety. From 1995 many Austen adaptations appeared with Ang Lees film of Sense and Sensibility for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award and the BBCs immensely popular TV mini-series Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A 2005 British production of Pride and Prejudice directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen was followed in 2007 by ITVs Mansfield Park Northanger Abbey and Persuasion and in 2016 by Love Friendship starring Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan a film version of Lady Susan that borrowed the title of Austens Love and Freindship . In 2013 Austens works featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the bicentenary of the publication of Pride and Prejudice. Austen is on the 10 note issued by the Bank of England which was introduced in 2017 replacing Charles Darwin. In July 2017 a statue of Jane Austen was erected in Basingstoke Hampshire on the 200th anniversary of her death.
Lord Byron,George Gordon Byron 6th Baron Byron FRS was an English romantic poet and peer. He was one of the leading figures of the Romantic movement and has been regarded as among the greatest of English poets. Among his best-known works are the lengthy narratives Don Juan and Childe Harolds Pilgrimage; many of his shorter lyrics in Hebrew Melodies also became popular. Lord Byron was educated at Trinity College Cambridge later travelling extensively across Europe to places such as Italy where he lived for seven years in Venice Ravenna and Pisa after he was forced to flee England due to lynching threats. During his stay in Italy he frequently visited his friend and fellow poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Later in life Byron joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire and died leading a campaign during that war for which Greeks revere him as a folk hero. He died in 1824 at the age of 36 from a fever contracted after the first and second sieges of Missolonghi. His only legitimate child Ada Lovelace was a founding figure in the field of computer programming based on her notes for Charles Babbages Analytical Engine. Byrons extramarital children include Allegra Byron who died in childhood and possibly Elizabeth Medora Leigh daughter of his half-sister Augusta Leigh. George Gordon Byron was born on 22 January 1788 on Holles Street in London England his birthplace is now supposedly occupied by a branch of the department store John Lewis. Byron was the only child of Captain John Byron and his second wife Catherine Gordon heiress of the Gight estate in Aberdeenshire Scotland. Byrons paternal grandparents were Vice-Admiral John Byron and Sophia Trevanion. Having survived a shipwreck as a teenage midshipman Vice Admiral John Byron set a new speed record for circumnavigating the globe. After he became embroiled in a tempestuous voyage during the American Revolutionary War John was nicknamed Foul-Weather Jack Byron by the press. Byrons father had previously been somewhat scandalously married to Amelia Marchioness of Carmarthen with whom he had been having an affair the wedding took place just weeks after her divorce from her husband and she was around eight months pregnant. The marriage was not a happy one and their first two children Sophia Georgina and an unnamed boy died in infancy. Amelia herself died in 1784 almost exactly a year after the birth of their third child the poets half-sister Augusta Mary. Though Amelia died from a wasting illness probably tuberculosis the press reported that her heart had been broken out of remorse for leaving her husband. Much later 19th-century sources blamed Jacks own brutal and vicious treatment of her. Jack then married Catherine Gordon of Gight on 13 May 1785 by all accounts only for her fortune. To claim his second wifes estate in Scotland Byrons father took the additional surname Gordon becoming John Byron Gordon and occasionally styled himself John Byron Gordon of Gight. Byrons mother had to sell her land and title to pay her new husbands debts and in the space of two years the large estate worth some 23500 had been squandered leaving the former heiress with an annual income in trust of only 150. In a move to avoid his creditors Catherine accompanied her profligate husband to France in 1786 but returned to England at the end of 1787 to give birth to her son. The boy was born on 22 January in lodgings at Holles Street in London and christened at St Marylebone Parish Church as George Gordon Byron. His father appears to have wished to call his son William but as her husband remained absent the young Byrons mother named him after her own father George Gordon of Gight who was a descendant of James I of Scotland and who had died by suicide some four years earlier in 1779. Catherine moved back to Aberdeenshire in 1790 and Byron spent part of his childhood there. His father soon joined them in their lodgings in Queen Street but the couple quickly separated. Catherine regularly experienced mood swings and bouts of melancholy which could be partly explained by her husbands continuingly borrowing money from her. As a result she fell even further into debt to support his demands. One of these loans enabled him to travel to Valenciennes France where he died of a long suffering illness probably tuberculosis in 1791. When Byrons great-uncle who was posthumously labelled the wicked Lord Byron died on 21 May 1798 the 10-year-old boy became the sixth Baron Byron of Rochdale and inherited the ancestral home Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire. His mother proudly took him to England but the Abbey was in an embarrassing state of disrepair and rather than live there she decided to lease it to Lord Grey de Ruthyn among others during Byrons adolescence. Described as a woman without judgment or self-command Catherine either spoiled and indulged her son or vexed him with her capricious stubbornness. Her drinking disgusted him and he often mocked her for being short and corpulent which made it difficult for her to catch him to discipline him. Byron had been born with a deformed right foot; his mother once retaliated and in a fit of temper referred to him as a lame brat. However Byrons biographer Doris Langley Moore in her 1974 book Accounts Rendered paints a more sympathetic view of Mrs Byron showing how she was a staunch supporter of her son and sacrificed her own precarious finances to keep him in luxury at Harrow and Cambridge. Langley-Moore questions 19th-century biographer John Galts claim that she over-indulged in alcohol. Byrons mother-in-law Judith Noel the Hon. Lady Milbanke died in 1822 and her will required that he change his surname to Noel in order to inherit half of her estate. He accordingly obtained a Royal Warrant enabling him to take and use the surname of Noel only and to subscribe the said surname of Noel before all titles of honour. From that point he signed himself Noel Byron . Some have speculated that he did this so that his initials would read N.B. mimicking those of his hero Napoleon Bonaparte. Lady Byron eventually succeeded to the Barony of Wentworth becoming Lady Wentworth. Byron received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School in 1798 until his move back to England as a 10-year-old. In August 1799 he entered the school of Dr. William Glennie in Dulwich. Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but could not restrain himself from violent bouts of activity in an attempt to compensate for his deformed foot. His mother interfered with his studies often withdrawing him from school which arguably contributed to his lack of self-discipline and his neglect of his classical studies. In 1801 he was sent to Harrow School where he remained until July 1805. An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer he nevertheless represented the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lords in 1805. His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise. Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth whom he met while at school and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803. His mother wrote He has no indisposition that I know of but love desperate love the worst of all maladies in my opinion. In short the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth. In Byrons later memoirs Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings. Byron finally returned in January 1804 to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys which he recalled with great vividness My school friendships were with me passions . The most enduring of those was with John FitzGibbon 2nd Earl of Clarefour years Byrons juniorwhom he was to meet again unexpectedly many years later in 1821 in Italy. His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships Childish Recollections express a prescient consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him. Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow John Thomas Claridge. The following autumn he entered Trinity College Cambridge where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston. About his protégé he wrote He has been my almost constant associate since October 1805 when I entered Trinity College. His voice first attracted my attention his countenance fixed it and his manners attached me to him for ever. After Edlestons death Byron composed Thyrza a series of elegies in his memory. In later years he described the affair as a violent though pure love and passion. This statement however needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions imposed upon convicted or even suspected offenders. The liaison on the other hand may well have been pure out of respect for Edlestons innocence in contrast to the more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School. The poem The Cornelian was written about the cornelian that Byron had received from Edleston. Byron spent three years at Trinity College engaging in sexual escapades boxing horse riding and gambling. While at Cambridge he also formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club which endorsed liberal politics and Francis Hodgson a Fellow at Kings College with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life. While not at school or college Byron lived at his mothers residence Burgage Manor in Southwell Nottinghamshire. While there he cultivated friendships with Elizabeth Bridget Pigot and her brother John with whom he staged two plays for the entertainment of the community. During this time with the help of Elizabeth Pigot who copied many of his rough drafts he was encouraged to write his first volumes of poetry. Fugitive Pieces was printed by Ridge of Newark which contained poems written when Byron was only 17. However it was promptly recalled and burned on the advice of his friend the Reverend J. T. Becher on account of its more amorous verses particularly the poem To Mary. Hours of Idleness a collection of many of the previous poems along with more recent compositions was the culminating book. The savage anonymous criticism it received in the Edinburgh Review prompted Byron to compose his first major satireEnglish Bards and Scotch Reviewers . Byron put it into the hands of his relative R. C. Dallas and asked him to ...get it published without his name.Alexander Dallas suggested a large number of changes to the manuscript and provided the reasoning for some of them. Dallas also stated that Byron had originally intended to prefix an argument to this poem which Dallas quoted. Although it was published anonymously that April R. C. Dallas wrote that you are already pretty generally known to be the author. The work so upset some of his critics that they challenged Byron to a duel; over time in subsequent editions it became a mark of prestige to be the target of Byrons pen. After his return from travels he entrusted R. C. Dallas as his literary agent with the publication of his poem Childe Harolds Pilgrimage which Byron thought to be of little account. The first two cantos of Childe Harolds Pilgrimage were published in 1812 and were received with critical acclaim. In Byrons own words I awoke one morning and found myself famous. He followed up this success with the poems last two cantos as well as four equally celebrated Oriental Tales The Giaour The Bride of Abydos The Corsair and Lara. About the same time he began his intimacy with his future biographer Thomas Moore. Byron racked up numerous debts as a young man owing to what his mother termed a reckless disregard for money. She lived at Newstead during this time in fear of her sons creditors. He had planned to spend some time in 1808 cruising with his cousin George Bettesworth who was captain of the 32-gun frigate HMS Tartar but Bettesworths death at the Battle of Alvøen in May 1808 made that impossible. From 1809 to 1811 Byron went on the Grand Tour then a customary part of the education of young noblemen. He travelled with Hobhouse for the first year and his entourage of servants included Byrons trustworthy valet William Fletcher. Hobhouse and Byron often made Fletcher the butt of their humour. The Napoleonic Wars forced Byron to avoid touring in most of Europe; he instead turned to the Mediterranean. His journey enabled him to avoid his creditors and to meet up with a former love Mary Chaworth . Letters to Byron from his friend Charles Skinner Matthews reveal that a key motive was also the hope of homosexual experiences. Another reason for choosing to visit the Mediterranean was probably his curiosity about the Levant; he had read about the Ottoman and Persian lands as a child was attracted to Islam and later wrote With these countries and events connected with them all my really poetical feelings begin and end. Byron began his trip in Portugal from where he wrote a letter to his friend Mr Hodgson in which he describes what he had learned of the Portuguese language mainly swear words and insults. Byron particularly enjoyed his stay in Sintra which he later described in Childe Harolds Pilgrimage as glorious Eden. From Lisbon he travelled overland to Seville Jerez de la Frontera Cádiz and Gibraltar and from there by sea to Sardinia Malta Albania and Greece. The purpose of Byrons and Hobhouses travel to Albania was to meet Ali Pasha of Ioannina and to see the country that was until then mostly unknown in Britain. While in Athens Byron met 14-year-old Nicolo Giraud with whom he became quite close and who taught him Italian. It has been suggested that the two may have had a sexual affair. Byron arranged to have Giraud enrolled in school at a monastery in Malta and wrote him into his will with a bequest of 7000. Byron wrote to Hobhouse from Athens I am tired of pl opt Cs the last thing I could be tired of. Opt Cs refers to a quote from Petronius Satyricon complete intercourse to ones hearts desire their shared code for homosexual experiences. In Athens in 1810 Byron wrote Maid of Athens ere we part for a 12-year-old girl Teresa Makri . Byron and Hobhouse made their way to Smyrna where they cadged a ride to Constantinople on HMS Salsette. On 3 May 1810 while Salsette was anchored awaiting Ottoman permission to dock at the city Byron and Lieutenant Ekenhead of Salsettes Marines swam the Hellespont. Byron commemorated this feat in the second canto of Don Juan. He returned to England from Malta in July 1811 aboard HMSVolage. After the publication of the first two cantos of Childe Harolds Pilgrimage Byron became a celebrity. He rapidly became the most brilliant star in the dazzling world of Regency London. He was sought after at every society venue elected to several exclusive clubs and frequented the most fashionable London drawing-rooms. During this period in England he produced many works including The Giaour The Bride of Abydos Parisina and The Siege of Corinth . On the initiative of the composer Isaac Nathan he produced in 18141815 the Hebrew Melodies . Involved at first in an affair with Lady Caroline Lamb and with other lovers and also pressed by debt he began to seek a suitable marriage considering amongst others Annabella Millbanke. However in 1813 he met for the first time in four years his half-sister Augusta Leigh. Rumours of incest surrounded the pair; Augustas daughter Medora was suspected to have been Byrons child. To escape from growing debts and rumours Byron pressed in his determination to marry Annabella who was said to be the likely heiress of a rich uncle. They married on 2 January 1815 and their daughter Ada was born in December of that year. However Byrons continuing obsession with Augusta Leigh made their marital life a misery. Annabella considered Byron insane and in January 1816 she left him taking their daughter and began proceedings for a legal separation. Their separation was made legal in a private settlement in March 1816. The scandal of the separation the rumours about Augusta and ever-increasing debts forced him to leave England in April 1816 never to return. After this break-up of his domestic life and by pressure on the part of his creditors which led to the sale of his library Byron left England and never returned. He journeyed through Belgium and continued up the Rhine river. In the summer of 1816 he settled at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva Switzerland with his personal physician John William Polidori. There Byron befriended the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and Shelleys future wife Mary Godwin. He was also joined by Marys stepsister Claire Clairmont with whom hed had an affair in London. Several times Byron went to see Germaine de Staël and her Coppet group which turned out to be a valid intellectual and emotional support to Byron at the time. Kept indoors at the Villa Diodati by the incessant rain of that wet ungenial summer over three days in June the five turned to reading fantastical stories including Fantasmagoriana and then devising their own tales. Mary Shelley produced what would become Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus and Polidori produced The Vampyre the progenitor of the Romantic vampire genre.The Vampyre was the inspiration for a fragmentary story of Byrons A Fragment. Byrons story fragment was published as a postscript to Mazeppa; he also wrote the third canto of Childe Harold. Byron wintered in Venice pausing in his travels when he fell in love with Marianna Segati in whose Venice house he was lodging and who was soon replaced by 22-year-old Margarita Cogni; both women were married. Cogni could not read or write and she left her husband to move in with Byron. Their fighting often caused Byron to spend the night in his gondola; when he asked her to leave the house she threw herself into the Venetian canal. In 1816 Byron visited San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice where he acquainted himself with Armenian culture with the help of the monks belonging to the Mechitarist Order. With the help of Father Pascal Aucher he learned the Armenian language and attended many seminars about language and history. He co-authored Grammar English and Armenian in 1817 an English textbook written by Aucher and corrected by Byron and A Grammar Armenian and English in 1819 a project he initiated of a grammar of Classical Armenian for English speakers where he included quotations from classical and modern Armenian. Byron later helped to compile the English Armenian Dictionary and wrote the preface in which he explained Armenian oppression by the Turkish pashas and the Persian satraps and the Armenian struggle of liberation. His two main translations are the Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians two chapters of Movses Khorenatsis History of Armenia and sections of Nerses of Lambrons Orations. His fascination was so great that he even considered a replacement of the Cain story of the Bible with that of the legend of the Armenian patriarch Haik. He may be credited with the birth of Armenology and its propagation. His profound lyricism and ideological courage have inspired many Armenian poets the likes of Ghevond Alishan Smbat Shahaziz Hovhannes Tumanyan Ruben Vorberian and others. In 1817 he journeyed to Rome. On returning to Venice he wrote the fourth canto of Childe Harold. About the same time he sold Newstead Abbey and published Manfred Cain and The Deformed Transformed. The first five cantos of Don Juan were written between 1818 and 1820. During this period he met the 21-year-old Countess Guiccioli who found her first love in Byron; he asked her to elope with him. Because of his love for the local aristocratic young newly married Teresa Guiccioli Byron lived in Ravenna from 1819 to 1821. Here he continued Don Juan and wrote the Ravenna Diary and My Dictionary and Recollections. Around this time he received visits from Percy Bysshe Shelley as well as from Thomas Moore to whom he confided his autobiography or life and adventures which Moore Hobhouse and Byrons publisher John Murray burned in 1824 a month after Byrons death. Of Byrons lifestyle in Ravenna we know more from Shelley who documented some of its more colourful aspects in a letter Lord Byron gets up at two. I get up quite contrary to my usual custom ... at 12. After breakfast we sit talking till six. From six to eight we gallop through the pine forest which divide Ravenna from the sea; we then come home and dine and sit up gossiping till six in the morning. I dont suppose this will kill me in a week or fortnight but I shall not try it longer. Lord B.s establishment consists besides servants of ten horses eight enormous dogs three monkeys five cats an eagle a crow and a falcon; and all these except the horses walk about the house which every now and then resounds with their unarbitrated quarrels as if they were the masters of it... . I find that my enumeration of the animals in this Circean Palace was defective ... . I have just met on the grand staircase five peacocks two guinea hens and an Egyptian crane. I wonder who all these animals were before they were changed into these shapes. In 1821 Byron left Ravenna and went to live in the Tuscan city of Pisa to which Teresa had also relocated. From 1821 to 1822 Byron finished Cantos 612 of Don Juan at Pisa and in the same year he joined with Leigh Hunt and Shelley in starting a short-lived newspaper The Liberal in whose first number The Vision of Judgment appeared. For the first time since his arrival in Italy Byron found himself tempted to give dinner parties; his guests included the Shelleys Edward Ellerker Williams Thomas Medwin John Taaffe and Edward John Trelawny; and never as Shelley said did he display himself to more advantage than on these occasions; being at once polite and cordial full of social hilarity and the most perfect good humour; never diverging into ungraceful merriment and yet keeping up the spirit of liveliness throughout the evening. Shelley and Williams rented a house on the coast and had a schooner built. Byron decided to have his own yacht and engaged Trelawnys friend Captain Daniel Roberts to design and construct the boat. Named the Bolivar it was later sold to Charles John Gardiner 1st Earl of Blessington and Marguerite Countess of Blessington when Byron left for Greece in 1823. Byron attended the beachside cremation of Shelley which was orchestrated by Trelawny after Williams and Shelley drowned in a boating accident on 8 July 1822. His last Italian home was in Genoa. While living there he was accompanied by the Countess Guiccioli and the Blessingtons. Lady Blessington based much of the material in her book Conversations with Lord Byron on the time spent together there. This book became an important biographical text about Byrons life just prior to his death. Byron was living in Genoa in 1823 when growing bored with his life there he accepted overtures for his support from representatives of the Greek independence movement from the Ottoman Empire. At first Byron did not wish to leave his 22-year-old mistress Countess Teresa Guiccioli who had abandoned her husband to live with him. But ultimately Guicciolis father Count Gamba was allowed to leave his exile in the Romagna under the condition that his daughter return to him without Byron. At the same time that the philhellene Edward Blaquiere was attempting to recruit him Byron was confused as to what he was supposed to do in Greece writing Blaquiere seemed to think that I might be of some use-even here;though what he did not exactly specify. With the assistance of his banker and Captain Daniel Roberts Byron chartered the brig Hercules to take him to Greece. When Byron left Genoa it caused passionate grief from Guiccioli who wept openly as he sailed away. The Hercules was forced to return to port shortly afterwards. When it set sail for the final time Guiccioli had already left Genoa. On 16 July Byron left Genoa arriving at Kefalonia in the Ionian Islands on 4 August. His voyage is covered in detail in Donald Prells Sailing with Byron from Genoa to Cephalonia. Prell also wrote of a coincidence in Byrons chartering the Hercules. The vessel was launched only a few miles south of Seaham Hall where in 1815 Byron married Annabella Milbanke. Between 1815 and 1823 the vessel was in service between England and Canada. Suddenly in 1823 the ships Captain decided to sail to Genoa and offer the Hercules for charter. After taking Byron to Greece the ship returned to England never again to venture into the Mediterranean. The Hercules was aged 37 when on 21 September 1852 she went aground near Hartlepool 25 miles south of Sunderland the place where her keel had been laid in 1815. Byrons keel was laid nine months before his official birth date 22 January 1788. Therefore in ship years he was also 37 when he died in Missolonghi. Byron initially stayed on the island of Kefalonia where he was besieged by agents of the rival Greek factions all of whom wanted to recruit Byron for their own cause. The Ionian islands of which Kefalonia is one were under British rule until 1864. Byron spent 4000 of his own money to refit the Greek fleet. When Byron travelled to the mainland of Greece on the night of 28 December 1823 Byrons ship was surprised by an Ottoman warship which did not attack his ship as the Ottoman captain mistook Byrons boat for a fireship. To avoid the Ottoman Navy which he encountered several times on his voyage Byron was forced to take a roundabout route and only reached Missolonghi on 5 January 1824. After arriving in Missolonghi Byron joined forces with Alexandros Mavrokordatos a Greek politician with military power. Byron moved to the second floor of a two-story house and was forced to spend much of his time dealing with unruly Souliotes who demanded that Byron pay them the back-pay owed to them by the Greek government. Byron gave the Souliotes some 6000. Byron was supposed to lead an attack on the Ottoman fortress of Navpaktos whose Albanian garrison were unhappy due to arrears in pay and who offered to put up only token resistance if Byron was willing to bribe them into surrendering. However Ottoman commander Yussuf Pasha executed the mutinous Albanian officers who were offering to surrender Navpaktos to Byron and arranged to have some of the arrears paid out to the rest of the garrison. Byron never led the attack on Navpaktos because the Souliotes kept demanding that Byron pay them more and more money before they would march; Byron grew tired of their blackmail and sent them all home on 15 February 1824. Byron wrote in a note to himself Having tried in vain at every expense considerable troubleand some danger to unite the Suliotes for the good of Greece-and their ownI have come to the following resolutionI will have nothing more to do with the Suliotes-they may go to the Turks or the devil...they may cut me into more pieces than they have dissensions among them sooner than change my resolution. At the same time Guicciolis brother Pietro Gamba who had followed Byron to Greece exasperated Byron with his incompetence as he continually made expensive mistakes. For example when asked to buy some cloth from Corfu Gamba ordered the wrong cloth in excess causing the bill to be 10 times higher than what Byron wanted. Byron wrote about his right-hand man Gambawho is anything but luckyhad something to do with itand as usualthe moment he hadmatters went wrong. To help raise money for the revolution Byron sold his estate in England Rochdale Manor which raised some 11250. This led Byron to estimate that he now had some 20000 at his disposal all of which he planned to spend on the Greek cause. In todays money Byron would have been a millionaire many times over. News that a fabulously wealthy British aristocrat known for his financial generosity had arrived in Greece made Byron the object of much solicitation in that desperately poor country. Byron wrote to his business agent in England I should not like to give the Greeks but a half helping hand saying he would have wanted to spend his entire fortune on Greek freedom. Byron found himself besieged by various people both Greek and foreign who tried to persuade him to open his pocketbook for support. By the end of March 1824 the so-called Byron brigade of 30 philhellene officers and about 200 men had been formed paid for entirely by Byron. Leadership of the Greek cause in the Roumeli region was divided between two rival leaders a former Klepht Odysseas Androutsos; and a wealthy Phanariot Prince Alexandros Mavrokordatos. Byron used his prestige to attempt to persuade the two rival leaders to come together to focus on defeating the Ottomans. At the same time other leaders of the Greek factions like Petrobey Mavromichalis and Theodoros Kolokotronis wrote letters to Byron telling him to disregard all of the Roumeliot leaders and to come to their respective areas in the Peloponnese. This drove Byron to distraction; he complained that the Greeks were hopelessly disunited and spent more time feuding with each other than trying to win independence. Byrons friend Edward John Trelawny had aligned himself with Androutsos who ruled Athens and was now pressing for Byron to break with Mavrokordatos in favour of backing the rival Androutsos. Androutsos having won over Trelawny to his cause was now anxious to persuade Byron to put his wealth behind his claim to be the leader of Greece. Byron wrote with disgust about how one of the Greek captains former Klepht Georgios Karaiskakis attacked Missolonghi on 3 April 1824 with some 150 men supported by the Souliotes as he was unhappy with Mavrokordatoss leadership which led to a brief bout of inter-Greek fighting before Karaiskakis was chased away by April 6. Byron adopted a nine-year-old Turkish Muslim girl called Hato whose parents had been killed by the Greeks. He ultimately sent her to safety in Kefalonia knowing well that religious hatred between the Orthodox Greeks and Muslim Turks was running high and that any Muslim in Greece even a child was in serious danger. Until 1934 most Turks did not have surnames; Hatos lack of a surname was quite typical for a Turkish family at this time. Byron pursued his Greek page Lukas Chalandritsanos with whom he had fallen madly in love but the affections went unrequited. Byron spoiled the teenage Chalandritsanos outrageously spending some 600 catering to his every whim over the course of 6 months and writing his last poems about his passion for the Greek boy. Chalandritsanos was only interested in Byrons money. When the famous Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen heard about Byrons heroics in Greece he voluntarily resculpted his earlier bust of Byron in Greek marble. Mavrokordatos and Byron planned to attack the Turkish-held fortress of Lepanto at the mouth of the Gulf of Corinth. Byron employed a fire master to prepare artillery and he took part of the rebel army under his own command despite his lack of military experience. Before the expedition could sail on February 15 1824 he fell ill and bloodletting weakened him further. He made a partial recovery but in early April he caught a violent cold; the therapeutic bleeding insisted on by his doctors exacerbated it. He contracted a violent fever and died in Missolonghi on 19 April. His physician at the time Julius van Millingen son of DutchEnglish archaeologist James Millingen was unable to prevent his death. It has been said that if Byron had lived and had gone on to defeat the Ottomans he might have been declared King of Greece. However modern scholars have found such an outcome unlikely. The British historian David Brewer wrote that in one sense Byron failed to persuade the rival Greek factions to unite won no victories and was successful only in the humanitarian sphere using his great wealth to help the victims of the war Christian and Muslim but this did not affect the outcome of the Greek war of independence. In another sense though Byron achieved everything he could have wished. His presence in Greece and in particular his death there drew to the Greek cause not just the attention of sympathetic nations but their increasing active participation ... Despite the critics Byron is primarily remembered with admiration as a poet of genius with something approaching veneration as a symbol of high ideals and with great affection as a man for his courage and his ironic slant on life for his generosity to the grandest of causes and to the humblest of individuals for the constant interplay of judgment and sympathy. In Greece he is still revered as no other foreigner and as very few Greeks are and like a Homeric hero he is accorded an honorific standard epithet megalos kai kalos a great and good man. Alfred Tennyson would later recall the shocked reaction in Britain when word was received of Byrons death. The Greeks mourned Lord Byron deeply and he became a hero. The national poet of Greece Dionysios Solomos wrote a poem about the unexpected loss named To the Death of Lord Byron. Βύρων the Greek form of Byron continues in popularity as a masculine name in Greece and a suburb of Athens is called Vyronas in his honour. Byrons body was embalmed but the Greeks wanted some part of their hero to stay with them. According to some sources his heart remained at Missolonghi. His other remains were sent to England for burial in Westminster Abbey but the Abbey refused for reason of questionable morality. Huge crowds viewed his coffin as he lay in state for two days at number 25 Great George Street Westminster. He is buried at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall Nottinghamshire. A marble slab given by the King of Greece is laid directly above Byrons grave. His daughter Ada Lovelace was later buried beside him. Byrons friends raised 1000 to commission a statue of the writer; Thorvaldsen offered to sculpt it for that amount. However after the statue was completed in 1834 for ten years British institutions turned it down and it remained in storage. It was refused by the British Museum St. Pauls Cathedral Westminster Abbey and the National Gallery before Trinity College Cambridge finally placed the statue of Byron in its library. In 1969 145 years after Byrons death a memorial to him was finally placed in Westminster Abbey. The memorial had been lobbied for As of 1907 The New York Times wrote People are beginning to ask whether this ignoring of Byron is not a thing of which England should be ashamed... a bust or a tablet might be put in the Poets Corner and England be relieved of ingratitude toward one of her really great sons. Robert Ripley had drawn a picture of Boatswains grave with the caption Lord Byrons dog has a magnificent tomb while Lord Byron himself has none. This came as a shock to the English particularly schoolchildren who Ripley said raised funds of their own accord to provide the poet with a suitable memorial. Close to the centre of Athens Greece outside the National Garden is a statue depicting Greece in the form of a woman crowning Byron. The statue is by the French sculptors Henri-Michel Chapu and Alexandre Falguière. As of 2008 the anniversary of Byrons death 19 April has been honoured in Greece as Byron Day. Upon his death the barony passed to Byrons cousin George Anson Byron a career naval officer. Byron described his first intense feelings at the age of seven for his distant cousin Mary Duff My mother used always to rally me about this childish amour and at last many years after when I was sixteen she told me one day O Byron I have had a letter from Edinburgh and your old sweetheart Mary Duff is married to Mr. C. And what was my answer I really cannot explain or account for my feelings at that moment but they nearly threw me into convulsions... How the deuce did all this occur so early Where could it originate I certainly had no sexual ideas for years afterwards; and yet my misery my love for that girl were so violent that I sometimes doubt if I have ever been really attached since. Be that as it may hearing of her marriage several years after was like a thunder-stroke it nearly choked me to the horror of my mother and the astonishment and almost incredulity of every body. And it is a phenomenon in my existence which has puzzled and will puzzle me to the latest hour of it; and lately I know not why the recollection has recurred as forcibly as ever...But the more I reflect the more I am bewildered to assign any cause for this precocity of affection. Byron also became attached to Margaret Parker another distant cousin. While his recollection of his love for Mary Duff is that he was ignorant of adult sexuality during this time and was bewildered as to the source of the intensity of his feelings he would later confess that My passions were developed very early so early that few would believe me if I were to state the period and the facts which accompanied it. Perhaps this was one of the reasons that caused the anticipated melancholy of my thoughts having anticipated life. When nine years old at his mothers house a Free Scotch girl used to come to bed to him and play tricks with his person. A few years later while he was still a child Lord Grey De Ruthyn a suitor of his mothers also made sexual advances on him. Byrons personality has been characterised as exceptionally proud and sensitive especially when it came to his foot deformity. His extreme reaction to seeing his mother flirting outrageously with Lord Grey De Ruthyn after the incident suggests he did not tell her of Greys conduct toward him; he simply refused to speak to him again and ignored his mothers commands to be reconciled.Leslie A. Marchand one of Byrons biographers theorises that Lord Grey De Ruthyns advances prompted Byrons later sexual liaisons with young men at Harrow and Cambridge. Byron was attached to Nicolo Giraud a young French-Greek lad who had been a model for the painter Lusieri before Byron found him. Byron left him 7000 in his will. When Byron returned to Italy he became involved with a number of boys in Venice but eventually settled on Loukas Chalandritsanos age 15 who was with him when he was killed . In 1812 Byron embarked on a well-publicised affair with the married Lady Caroline Lamb that shocked the British public. She had spurned the attention of the poet on their first meeting subsequently giving Byron what became his lasting epitaph when she famously described him as mad bad and dangerous to know. This did not prevent her from pursuing him. Byron eventually broke off the relationship and moved swiftly on to others but Lamb never entirely recovered pursuing him even after he tired of her. She was emotionally disturbed and lost so much weight that Byron sarcastically commented to her mother-in-law his friend Lady Melbourne that he was haunted by a skeleton.She began to stalk him calling on him at home sometimes dressed in disguise as a pageboy at a time when such an act could ruin both of them socially. Once during such a visit she wrote on a book at his desk Remember me As a retort Byron wrote a poem entitled Remember Thee Remember Thee which concludes with the line Thou false to him thou fiend to me. As a child Byron had seen little of his half-sister Augusta Leigh; in adulthood he formed a close relationship with her that has been interpreted by some as incestuous and by others as innocent. Augusta gave birth on 15 April 1814 to her third daughter Elizabeth Medora Leigh rumoured by some to be Byrons. Eventually Byron began to court Lady Carolines cousin Anne Isabella Milbanke who refused his first proposal of marriage but later accepted him. Milbanke was a highly moral woman intelligent and mathematically gifted; she was also an heiress. They married at Seaham Hall County Durham on 2 January 1815. The marriage proved unhappy. They had a daughter Augusta Ada. On 16 January 1816 Lady Byron left him taking Ada with her. That same year on 21 April Byron signed the Deed of Separation. Rumours of marital violence adultery with actresses incest with Augusta Leigh and sodomy were circulated assisted by a jealous Lady Caroline. In a letter Augusta quoted him as saying Even to have such a thing said is utter destruction and ruin to a man from which he can never recover. That same year Lady Caroline published her popular novel Glenarvon in which Lord Byron was portrayed as the seedy title character. Byron wrote a letter to John Hanson from Newstead Abbey dated 17 January 1809 that includes You will discharge my Cook Laundry Maid the other two I shall retain to take care of the house more especially as the youngest is pregnant and I cannot have the girl on the parish. His reference to The youngest is understood to have been to a maid Lucy and the parenthesised remark to indicate himself as siring a son born that year. In 2010 part of a baptismal record was uncovered which apparently said September 24 George illegitimate son of Lucy Monk illegitimate son of Baron Byron of Newstead Nottingham Newstead Abbey. Augusta Leighs child Elizabeth Medora Leigh born in 1814 was possibly fathered by Byron who was Augustas half-brother. Byron had a child The Hon. Augusta Ada Byron in 1815 by his wife Annabella Byron Lady Byron later Lady Wentworth. Ada Lovelace notable in her own right collaborated with Charles Babbage on the analytical engine a predecessor to modern computers. She is recognised as one of the worlds first computer programmers. He also had an extramarital child in 1817 Clara Allegra Byron with Claire Clairmont stepsister of Mary Shelley and stepdaughter of William Godwin writer of Political Justice and Caleb Williams. Allegra is not entitled to the style The Hon. as is usually given to the daughter of barons since she was born outside of his marriage. Born in Bath in 1817 Allegra lived with Byron for a few months in Venice; he refused to allow an Englishwoman caring for the girl to adopt her and objected to her being raised in the Shelleys household. He wished for her to be brought up Catholic and not marry an Englishman and he made arrangements for her to inherit 5000 lire upon marriage or when she reached the age of 21 provided she did not marry a native of Britain. However the girl died aged five of a fever in Bagnacavallo Italy while Byron was in Pisa; he was deeply upset by the news. He had Allegras body sent back to England to be buried at his old school Harrow because Protestants could not be buried in consecrated ground in Catholic countries. At one time he himself had wanted to be buried at Harrow. Byron was antagonistic towards Allegras mother Claire Clairmont and prevented her from seeing the child. Although neglected by traditional historiography Byron had a complex identity and strong ties to Scotland. His maternal family the Gordons had its roots in Aberdeenshire and Byron was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School between 1794 and 1798. In terms of his own identity he described himself as half a Scot by birth and bredA whole one and he reportedly spoke with a faint Scottish accent throughout his life. Byron was regarded as a Scot by a number of his contemporaries including his lover Lady Caroline Lamb and by his first biographer Sir Cosmo Gordon who described him as a Highlander. Byrons links to Scotland were demonstrated in his campaign for the liberation of Greece where a disproportionate number of his closest friends and associates had strong Scottish connexions particularly with regard to north-eastern Scotland which through his Gordon links remained central to the Byronic network throughout his life. Byron enjoyed adventure especially relating to the sea. The first recorded notable example of open water swimming took place on 3 May 1810 when Lord Byron swam from Europe to Asia across the Hellespont Strait. This is often seen as the birth of the sport and pastime and to commemorate it the event is recreated every year as an open water swimming event. Whilst sailing from Genoa to Cephalonia in 1823 every day at noon Byron and Trelawny in calm weather jumped overboard for a swim without fear of sharks which were not unknown in those waters. Once according to Trelawny they let the geese and ducks loose and followed them and the dogs into the water each with an arm in the ship Captains new scarlet waistcoat to the annoyance of the Captain and the amusement of the crew. Byron had a great love of animals most notably for a Newfoundland dog named Boatswain. When the animal contracted rabies Byron nursed him albeit unsuccessfully without any thought or fear of becoming bitten and infected. Although deeply in debt at the time Byron commissioned an impressive marble funerary monument for Boatswain at Newstead Abbey larger than his own and the only building work that he ever carried out on his estate. In his 1811 will Byron requested that he be buried with him. The 26line poem Epitaph to a Dog has become one of his best-known works. But a draft of an 1830 letter by Hobhouse shows him to be the author; Byron decided to use Hobhouses lengthy epitaph instead of his own which read To mark a friends remains these stones ariseI never knew but one and here he lies. Byron also kept a tame bear while he was a student at Trinity out of resentment for rules forbidding pet dogs like his beloved Boatswain. There being no mention of bears in their statutes the college authorities had no legal basis for complaining; Byron even suggested that he would apply for a college fellowship for the bear. During his lifetime in addition to numerous cats dogs and horses Byron kept a fox monkeys an eagle a crow a falcon peacocks guinea hens an Egyptian crane a badger geese a heron and a goat. Except for the horses they all resided indoors at his homes in England Switzerland Italy and Greece.Percy Shelley visiting Byron in Italy in 1821 described his menagerie I am such a strange mélange of good and evil that it would be difficult to describe me. As a boy Byrons character is described as a mixture of affectionate sweetness and playfulness by which it was impossible not to be attached although he also exhibited silent rages moody sullenness and revenge with a precocious bent for attachment and obsession. From birth Byron had a deformity of his right foot. Although it has generally been referred to as a club foot some modern medical authors maintain that it was a consequence of infantile paralysis and others that it was a dysplasia a failure of the bones to form properly. Whatever the cause he was affected by a limp that caused him lifelong psychological and physical misery aggravated by painful and pointless medical treatment in his childhood and the nagging suspicion that with proper care it might have been cured. He was extremely self-conscious about this from a young age nicknaming himself . Although he often wore specially-made shoes in an attempt to hide the deformed foot he refused to wear any type of brace that might improve the limp. Scottish novelist John Galt felt his oversensitivity to the innocent fault in his foot was unmanly and excessive because the limp was not greatly conspicuous. He first met Byron on a voyage to Sardinia and did not realise he had any deficiency for several days and still could not tell at first if the lameness was a temporary injury or not. At the time Galt met him he was an adult and had worked to develop a mode of walking across a room by which it was scarcely at all perceptible. The motion of the ship at sea may also have helped to create a favourable first impression and hide any deficiencies in his gait but Galts biography is also described as being rather well-meant than well-written so Galt may be guilty of minimising a defect that was actually still noticeable. Byrons adult height was 5feet 9inches his weight fluctuating between 9.5 stone and 14 stone . He was renowned for his personal beauty which he enhanced by wearing curl-papers in his hair at night. He was athletic being a competent boxer and horse-rider and an excellent swimmer. He attended pugilistic tuition at the Bond Street rooms of former prizefighting champion Gentleman John Jackson whom Byron called the Emperor of Pugilism and recorded these sparring sessions in his letters and journals. Byron and other writers such as his friend Hobhouse described his eating habits in detail. At the time he entered Cambridge he went on a strict diet to control his weight. He also exercised a great deal and at that time wore a great many clothes to cause himself to perspire. For most of his life he was a vegetarian and often lived for days on dry biscuits and white wine. Occasionally he would eat large helpings of meat and desserts after which he would purge himself. Although he is described by Galt and others as having a predilection for violent exercise Hobhouse suggests that the pain in his deformed foot made physical activity difficult and that his weight problem was the result. Trelawny who observed Byrons eating habits noted that he lived on a diet of biscuits and soda water for days at a time and then would eat a horrid mess of cold potatoes rice fish or greens deluged in vinegar and gobble it up like a famished dog. Byron first took his seat in the House of Lords on 13 March 1809 but left London on 11 June 1809 for the Continent. Byrons association with the Holland House Whigs provided him with a discourse of liberty rooted in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. A strong advocate of social reform he received particular praise as one of the few Parliamentary defenders of the Luddites specifically he was against a death penalty for Luddite frame breakers in Nottinghamshire who destroyed textile machines that were putting them out of work. His first speech before the Lords on 27 February 1812 was loaded with sarcastic references to the benefits of automation which he saw as producing inferior material as well as putting people out of work and concluded the proposed law was only missing two things to be effective Twelve Butchers for a Jury and a Jeffries for a Judge. Byrons speech was officially recorded and printed in Hansard. He said later that he spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest impudence and thought he came across as a bit theatrical. The full text of the speech which he had previously written out was presented to Dallas in manuscript form and he quotes it in his work. Two months later in conjunction with the other Whigs Byron made another impassioned speech before the House of Lords in support of Catholic emancipation. Byron expressed opposition to the established religion because it was unfair to people of other faiths. These experiences inspired Byron to write political poems such as Song for the Luddites and The Landlords Interest Canto XIV of The Age of Bronze.Examples of poems in which he attacked his political opponents include Wellington The Best of the Cut-Throats and The Intellectual Eunuch Castlereagh . Byron wrote prolifically. In 1832 his publisher John Murray released the complete works in 14 duodecimo volumes including a life by Thomas Moore. Subsequent editions were released in 17 volumes first published a year later in 1833. An extensive collection of his works including early editions and annotated manuscripts is held within the John Murray Archive at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh. Byrons magnum opus Don Juan a poem spanning 17 cantos ranks as one of the most important long poems published in England since John Miltons Paradise Lost. Byron published the first two cantos anonymously in 1819 after disputes with his regular publisher over the shocking nature of the poetry. By this time he had been a famous poet for seven years and when he self-published the beginning cantos they were well received in some quarters. The poem was then released volume by volume through his regular publishing house. By 1822 cautious acceptance by the public had turned to outrage and Byrons publisher refused to continue to publish the work. In Canto III of Don Juan Byron expresses his detestation for poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In letters to Francis Hodgson Byron referred to Wordsworth as Turdsworth. Byron wrote the satirical pamphlet Irish Avatar after the royal visit by King George IV to Ireland. Byron criticised the attitudes displayed by the Irish people towards the Crown an institution he perceived as oppressing them and was dismayed by the positive reception George IV received during his visit. In the pamphlet Byron lambasted Irish unionists and voiced muted support towards nationalistic sentiments in Ireland. Byron was a bitter opponent of Lord Elgins removal of the Parthenon marbles from Athens and reacted with fury when Elgins agent gave him a tour of the Parthenon during which he saw the spaces left by the missing part of the frieze and metopes. He denounced Elgins actions in his poem The Curse of Minerva and in Canto II of Childe Harolds Pilgrimage. Byrons image as the personification of the Byronic hero fascinated the public and his wife Annabella coined the term Byromania to refer to the commotion surrounding him. His self-awareness and personal promotion are seen as a beginning of what would become the modern rock star; he would instruct artists painting portraits of him not to paint him with pen or book in hand but as a man of action. While Byron first welcomed fame he later turned from it by going into voluntary exile from Britain. Biographies were distorted by the burning of Byrons memoir in the offices of his publisher John Murray a month after his death and the suppression of details of Byrons bisexuality by subsequent heads of the firm . As late as the 1950s scholar Leslie Marchand was expressly forbidden by the Murray company to reveal details of Byrons same-sex passions. The re-founding of the Byron Society in 1971 reflected the fascination that many people had with Byron and his work. This society became very active publishing an annual journal. Thirty-six Byron Societies function throughout the world and an International Conference takes place annually. Byron exercised a marked influence on Continental literature and art and his reputation as a poet is higher in many European countries than in Britain or America although not as high as in his time when he was widely thought to be the greatest poet in the world. Byrons writings also inspired many composers. Over forty operas have been based on his works in addition to three operas about Byron himself . His poetry was set to music by many Romantic composers including Beethoven Schubert Rossini Mendelssohn Schumann and Carl Loewe. Among his greatest admirers was Hector Berlioz whose operas and Mémoires reveal Byrons influence. In the twentieth century Arnold Schoenberg set Byrons Ode to Napoleon to music. In April 2020 Byron was featured in a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to commemorate the Romantic poets on the 250th anniversary of the birth of William Wordsworth. Ten 1st class stamps were issued of all the major British romantic poets and each stamp included an extract from one of their most popular and enduring works with Byrons She Walks in Beauty selected for the poet. The figure of the Byronic hero pervades much of his work and Byron himself is considered to epitomise many of the characteristics of this literary figure. The use of a Byronic hero by many authors and artists of the Romantic movement show Byrons influence during the 19th century and beyond including the Brontë sisters. His philosophy was more durably influential in continental Europe than in England; Friedrich Nietzsche admired him and the Byronic hero was echoed in Nietzsches Übermensch or superman.Dimitrios Galanos in his funeral oration for Lord Byron glorified him by saying IMMORTAL BE THY MEMORY THOU DESERVEDLY BLESSED AND EVER-TO-BE-REMEMBERED HERO published in BENGAL HURKARU Calcutta October 21 1824.  The Byronic hero presents an idealised but flawed character whose attributes include great talent; great passion; a distaste for society and social institutions; a lack of respect for rank and privilege ; being thwarted in love by social constraint or death; rebellion; exile; an unsavoury secret past; arrogance; overconfidence or lack of foresight; and ultimately a self-destructive manner. These types of characters have since become ubiquitous in literature and politics.
Percy Bysshe Shelley,Percy Bysshe Shelley was a British writer who is considered one of the major English Romantic poets. A radical in his poetry as well as in his political and social views Shelley did not achieve fame during his lifetime but recognition of his achievements in poetry grew steadily following his death and he became an important influence on subsequent generations of poets including Robert Browning Algernon Charles Swinburne Thomas Hardy and W. B. Yeats. American literary critic Harold Bloom describes him as a superb craftsman a lyric poet without rival and surely one of the most advanced sceptical intellects ever to write a poem. Shelleys reputation fluctuated during the 20th century but in recent decades he has achieved increasing critical acclaim for the sweeping momentum of his poetic imagery his mastery of genres and verse forms and the complex interplay of sceptical idealist and materialist ideas in his work. Among his best-known works are Ozymandias Ode to the West Wind To a Skylark the philosophical essay The Necessity of Atheism which his friend T. J. Hogg may have co-authored and the political ballad The Mask of Anarchy . His other major works include the verse drama The Cenci and long poems such as Alastor or The Spirit of Solitude Julian and Maddalo Adonais Prometheus Unbound widely considered his masterpieceHellas and his final unfinished work The Triumph of Life . Shelley also wrote prose fiction and a quantity of essays on political social and philosophical issues. Much of this poetry and prose was not published in his lifetime or only published in expurgated form due to the risk of prosecution for political and religious libel. From the 1820s his poems and political and ethical writings became popular in Owenist Chartist and radical political circles and later drew admirers as diverse as Karl Marx Mahatma Gandhi and George Bernard Shaw. Shelleys life was marked by family crises ill health and a backlash against his atheism political views and defiance of social conventions. He went into permanent self-exile in Italy in 1818 and over the next four years produced what Zachary Leader and Michael ONeill call some of the finest poetry of the Romantic period. His second wife Mary Shelley was the author of Frankenstein. He died in a boating accident in 1822 at the age of 29. Shelley was born on 4 August 1792 at Field Place Warnham West Sussex England. He was the eldest son of Sir Timothy Shelley a Whig Member of Parliament for Horsham from 1790 to 1792 and for Shoreham between 1806 and 1812 and his wife Elizabeth Pilfold the daughter of a successful butcher. He had four younger sisters and one much younger brother. Shelleys early childhood was sheltered and mostly happy. He was particularly close to his sisters and his mother who encouraged him to hunt fish and ride. At age six he was sent to a day school run by the vicar of Warnham church where he displayed an impressive memory and gift for languages. In 1802 he entered the Syon House Academy of Brentford Middlesex where his cousin Thomas Medwin was a pupil. Shelley was bullied and unhappy at the school and sometimes responded with violent rage. He also began suffering from the nightmares hallucinations and sleep walking that were to periodically affect him throughout his life. Shelley developed an interest in science which supplemented his voracious reading of tales of mystery romance and the supernatural. During his holidays at Field Place his sisters were often terrified at being subjected to his experiments with gunpowder acids and electricity. Back at school he blew up a paling fence with gunpowder. In 1804 Shelley entered Eton College a period which he later recalled with loathing. He was subjected to particularly severe mob bullying which the perpetrators called Shelley-baits. A number of biographers and contemporaries have attributed the bullying to Shelleys aloofness nonconformity and refusal to take part in fagging. His peculiarities and violent rages earned him the nickname Mad Shelley. His interest in the occult and science continued and contemporaries describe him giving an electric shock to a master blowing up a tree stump with gunpowder and attempting to raise spirits with occult rituals. In his senior years Shelley came under the influence of a part-time teacher Dr James Lind who encouraged his interest in the occult and introduced him to liberal and radical authors. Shelley also developed an interest in Plato and idealist philosophy which he pursued in later years through self-study. According to Richard Holmes Shelley by his leaving year had gained a reputation as a classical scholar and a tolerated eccentric. In his last term at Eton his first novel Zastrozzi appeared and he had established a following among his fellow pupils. Prior to enrolling for University College Oxford in October 1810 Shelley completed Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire the verse melodrama The Wandering Jew and the gothic novel St. Irvine; or The Rosicrucian A Romance . At Oxford Shelley attended few lectures instead spending long hours reading and conducting scientific experiments in the laboratory he set up in his room. He met a fellow student Thomas Jefferson Hogg who became his closest friend. Shelley became increasingly politicised under Hoggs influence developing strong radical and anti-Christian views. Such views were dangerous in the reactionary political climate prevailing during Britains war with Napoleonic France and Shelleys father warned him against Hoggs influence. In the winter of 18101811 Shelley published a series of anonymous political poems and tracts Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson The Necessity of Atheism and A Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things. Shelley mailed The Necessity of Atheism to all the bishops and heads of colleges at Oxford and he was called to appear before the colleges fellows including the Dean George Rowley. His refusal to answer questions put by college authorities regarding whether or not he authored the pamphlet resulted in his expulsion from Oxford on 25March 1811 along with Hogg. Hearing of his sons expulsion Shelleys father threatened to cut all contact with Shelley unless he agreed to return home and study under tutors appointed by him. Shelleys refusal to do so led to a falling-out with his father. In late December 1810 Shelley had met Harriet Westbrook a pupil at the same boarding school as Shelleys sisters. They corresponded frequently that winter and also after Shelley had been expelled from Oxford. Shelley expounded his radical ideas on politics religion and marriage to Harriet and they gradually convinced each other that she was oppressed by her father and at school. Shelleys infatuation with Harriet developed in the months following his expulsion when he was under severe emotional strain due to the conflict with his family his bitterness over the breakdown of his romance with his cousin Harriet Grove and his unfounded belief that he might have a fatal illness. At the same time Harriet Westbrooks elder sister Eliza to whom Harriet was very close encouraged the young girls romance with Shelley. Shelleys correspondence with Harriet intensified in July while he was holidaying in Wales and in response to her urgent pleas for his protection he returned to London in early August. Putting aside his philosophical objections to matrimony he left with the sixteen-year-old Harriet for Edinburgh on 25 August 1811 and they were married there on the 28th. Hearing of the elopement Harriets father John Westbrook and Shelleys father Timothy cut off the allowances of the bride and groom.  Surviving on borrowed money Shelley and Harriet stayed in Edinburgh for a month with Hogg living under the same roof. The trio left for York in October and Shelley went on to Sussex to settle matters with his father leaving Harriet behind with Hogg. Shelley returned from his unsuccessful excursion to find that Eliza had moved in with Harriet and Hogg. Harriet confessed that Hogg had tried to seduce her while Shelley had been away. Shelley Harriet and Eliza soon left for Keswick in the Lake District leaving Hogg in York. At this time Shelley was also involved in an intense platonic relationship with Elizabeth Hitchener a 28-year-old unmarried schoolteacher of advanced views with whom he had been corresponding. Hitchener whom Shelley called the sister of my soul and my second self became his confidante and intellectual companion as he developed his views on politics religion ethics and personal relationships. Shelley proposed that she join him Harriet and Eliza in a communal household where all property would be shared. The Shelleys and Eliza spent December and January in Keswick where Shelley visited Robert Southey whose poetry he admired. Southey was taken with Shelley even though there was a wide gulf between them politically and predicted great things for him as a poet. Southey also informed Shelley that William Godwin author of Political Justice which had greatly influenced him in his youth and which Shelley also admired was still alive. Shelley wrote to Godwin offering himself as his devoted disciple. Godwin who had modified many of his earlier radical views advised Shelley to reconcile with his father become a scholar before he published anything else and give up his avowed plans for political agitation in Ireland. Meanwhile Shelley had met his fathers patron Charles Howard 11th Duke of Norfolk who helped secure the reinstatement of Shelleys allowance. With Harriets allowance also restored Shelley now had the funds for his Irish venture. Their departure for Ireland was precipitated by increasing hostility towards the Shelley household from their landlord and neighbours who were alarmed by Shelleys scientific experiments pistol shooting and radical political views. As tension mounted Shelley claimed he had been attacked in his home by ruffians an event which might have been real or a delusional episode triggered by stress. This was the first of a series of episodes in subsequent years where Shelley claimed to have been attacked by strangers during periods of personal crisis. Early in 1812 Shelley wrote published and personally distributed in Dublin three political tracts An Address to the Irish People; Proposals for an Association of Philanthropists; and Declaration of Rights. He also delivered a speech at a meeting of OConnells Catholic Committee in which he called for Catholic emancipation repeal of the Acts of Union and an end to the oppression of the Irish poor. Reports of Shelleys subversive activities were sent to the Home Secretary. Returning from Ireland the Shelley household travelled to Wales then Devon where they again came under government surveillance for distributing subversive literature. Elizabeth Hitchener joined the household in Devon but several months later had a falling out with the Shelleys and left. The Shelley household had settled in Tremadog Wales in September 1812 where Shelley worked on Queen Mab a utopian allegory with extensive notes preaching atheism free love republicanism and vegetarianism. The poem was published the following year in a private edition of 250 copies although few were initially distributed because of the risk of prosecution for seditious and religious libel. In February 1813 Shelley claimed he was attacked in his home at night. The incident might have been real a hallucination brought on by stress or a hoax staged by Shelley in order to escape government surveillance creditors and his entanglements in local politics. The Shelleys and Eliza fled to Ireland then London. Back in England Shelleys debts mounted as he tried unsuccessfully to reach a financial settlement with his father. On 23 June Harriet gave birth to a girl Eliza Ianthe Shelley and in the following months the relationship between Shelley and his wife deteriorated. Shelley resented the influence Harriets sister had over her while Harriet was alienated by Shelleys close friendship with an attractive widow Mrs Boinville and her daughter Cornelia Turner. Mrs Boinville had married a French revolutionary émigré and hosted a salon where Shelley was able to discuss politics philosophy and vegetarianism. Mrs Boinville became a confidante of Shelley during his marital crisis and he probably fell in love with her daughter. Following Ianthes birth the Shelleys moved frequently across London Wales the Lake District Scotland and Berkshire to escape creditors and search for a home. In March 1814 Shelley remarried Harriet in London to settle any doubts about the legality of their Edinburgh wedding and secure the rights of their child. Nevertheless the Shelleys lived apart for most of the following months and Shelley reflected bitterly on my rash heartless union with Harriet. In May 1814 Shelley began visiting his mentor Godwin almost daily and soon fell in love with Mary the sixteen-year-old daughter of Godwin and the late feminist author Mary Wollstonecraft. Shelley and Mary declared their love for each other during a visit to her mothers grave in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church on 26 June. When Shelley told Godwin that he intended to leave Harriet and live with Mary his mentor banished him from the house and forbade Mary from seeing him. Shelley and Mary eloped to Europe on 28 July taking Marys step-sister Claire Clairmont with them. Before leaving Shelley had secured a loan of 3000 but had left most of the funds at the disposal of Godwin and Harriet who was now pregnant. The financial arrangement with Godwin led to rumours that he had sold his daughters to Shelley. Shelley Mary and Claire made their way across war-ravaged France where Shelley wrote to Harriet asking her to meet them in Switzerland with the money he had left for her. Hearing nothing from Harriet in Switzerland and unable to secure sufficient funds or suitable accommodation the three travelled to Germany and Holland before returning to England on 13 September. Shelley spent the next few months trying to raise loans and avoid bailiffs. Mary was pregnant lonely depressed and ill. Her mood was not improved when she heard that on 30 November Harriet had given birth to Charles Bysshe Shelley heir to the Shelley fortune and baronetcy. This was followed in early January 1815 by news that Shelleys grandfather Sir Bysshe had died leaving an estate worth 220000. The settlement of the estate and a financial settlement between Shelley and his father however was not concluded until April the following year. In February 1815 Mary gave premature birth to a baby girl who died ten days later deepening her depression. In the following weeks Mary became close to Hogg who temporarily moved into the household. Shelley was almost certainly having a sexual relationship with Claire at this time and it is possible that Mary with Shelleys encouragement was also having a sexual relationship with Hogg. In May Claire left the household at Marys insistence to reside in Lynmouth. In August Shelley and Mary moved to Bishopsgate where Shelley worked on Alastor a long poem in blank verse based on the myth of Narcissus and Echo. Alastor was published in an edition of 250 in early 1816 to poor sales and largely unfavourable reviews from the conservative press. On 24 January 1816 Mary gave birth to William Shelley. Shelley was delighted to have another son but was suffering from the strain of prolonged financial negotiations with his father Harriet and William Godwin. Shelley showed signs of delusional behaviour and was contemplating an escape to the continent. Claire initiated a sexual relationship with Lord Byron in April 1816 just before his self-exile on the continent and then arranged for Byron to meet Shelley Mary and her in Geneva. Shelley admired Byrons poetry and had sent him Queen Mab and other poems. Shelleys party arrived in Geneva in May and rented a house close to Villa Diodati on the shores of Lake Geneva where Byron was staying. There Shelley Byron and the others engaged in discussions about literature science and various philosophical doctrines. One night while Byron was reciting Coleridges Christabel Shelley suffered a severe panic attack with hallucinations. The previous night Mary had had a more productive vision or nightmare which inspired her novel Frankenstein. Shelley and Byron then took a boating tour around Lake Geneva which inspired Shelley to write his Hymn to Intellectual Beauty his first substantial poem since Alastor. A tour of Chamonix in the French Alps inspired Mont Blanc which has been described as an atheistic response to Coleridges Hymn before Sunrise in the Vale of Chamoni. During this tour Shelley often signed guest books with a declaration that he was an atheist. These declarations were seen by other British tourists including Southey which hardened attitudes against Shelley back home. Relations between Byron and Shelleys party became strained when Byron was told that Claire was pregnant with his child. Shelley Mary and Claire left Switzerland in late August with arrangements for the expected baby still unclear although Shelley made provision for Claire and the baby in his will. In January 1817 Claire gave birth to a daughter by Byron who she named Alba but later renamed Allegra in accordance with Byrons wishes.

Near them on the sandHalf sunk a shattered visage lies whose frownAnd wrinkled lip and sneer of cold commandTell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive stamped on these lifeless thingsThe hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;And on the pedestal these words appearMy name is Ozymandias King of Kings;Look on my Works ye Mighty and despairNothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal Wreck boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away. Shelley and Mary returned to England in September 1816 and in early October they heard that Marys half-sister Fanny Imlay had killed herself. Godwin believed that Fanny had been in love with Shelley and Shelley himself suffered depression and guilt over her death writing Friend had I known thy secret grief Should we have parted so. Further tragedy followed in December when Shelleys estranged wife Harriet drowned herself in the Serpentine. Harriet pregnant and living alone at the time believed that she had been abandoned by her new lover. In her suicide letter she asked Shelley to take custody of their son Charles but to leave their daughter in her sister Elizas care. Shelley married Mary Godwin on 30 December despite his philosophical objections to the institution. The marriage was intended to help secure Shelleys custody of his children by Harriet and to placate Godwin who had refused to see Shelley and Mary because of their previous adulterous relationship. After a prolonged legal battle the Court of Chancery eventually awarded custody of Shelley and Harriets children to foster parents on the grounds that Shelley had abandoned his first wife for Mary without cause and was an atheist. In March 1817 the Shelleys moved to the village of Marlow Buckinghamshire where Shelleys friend Thomas Love Peacock lived. The Shelley household included Claire and her baby Allegra both of whose presence Mary resented. Shelleys generosity with money and increasing debts also led to financial and marital stress as did Godwins frequent requests for financial help. On 2 September Mary gave birth to a daughter Clara Everina Shelley. Soon after Shelley left for London with Claire which increased Marys resentment towards her stepsister. Shelley was arrested for two days in London over money he owed and attorneys visited Mary in Marlowe over Shelleys debts. Shelley took part in the literary and political circle that surrounded Leigh Hunt and during this period he met William Hazlitt and John Keats. Shelleys major work during this time was Laon and Cythna a long narrative poem featuring incest and attacks on religion. It was hastily withdrawn after publication due to fears of prosecution for religious libel and was re-edited and reissued as The Revolt of Islam in January 1818. Shelley also published two political tracts under a pseudonym A Proposal for putting Reform to the Vote throughout the Kingdom and An Address to the People on the Death of Princess Charlotte . In December he wrote Ozymandias which is considered to be one of his finest sonnets as part of a competition with friend and fellow poet Horace Smith. On 12 March 1818 the Shelleys and Claire left England to escape its tyranny civil and religious. A doctor had also recommended that Shelley go to Italy for his chronic lung complaint and Shelley had arranged to take Claires daughter Allegra to her father Byron who was now in Venice. After travelling some months through France and Italy Shelley left Mary and baby Clara at Bagni di Lucca while he travelled with Claire to Venice to see Byron and make arrangements for visiting Allegra. Byron invited the Shelleys to stay at his summer residence at Este and Shelley urged Mary to meet him there. Clara became seriously ill on the journey and died on 24 September in Venice. Following Claras death Mary fell into a long period of depression and emotional estrangement from Shelley. The Shelleys moved to Naples on 1 December where they stayed for three months. During this period Shelley was ill depressed and almost suicidal a state of mind reflected in his poem Stanzas written in Dejection December 1818 Near Naples. While in Naples Shelley registered the birth and baptism of a baby girl Elena Adelaide Shelley naming himself as the father and falsely naming Mary as the mother. The parentage of Elena has never been conclusively established. Biographers have variously speculated that she was adopted by Shelley to console Mary for the loss of Clara that she was Shelleys child by Claire that she was his child by his servant Elise Foggi or that she was the child of a mysterious lady who had followed Shelley to the continent. Shelley registered the birth and baptism on 27 February 1819 and the household left Naples for Rome the following day leaving Elena with carers. Elena was to die in a poor suburb of Naples on 9 June 1820. In Rome Shelley was in poor health probably having developed nephritis and tuberculosis which later was in remission. Nevertheless he made significant progress on three major works Julian and Maddalo Prometheus Unbound and The Cenci.Julian and Maddalo is an autobiographical poem which explores the relationship between Shelley and Byron and analyses Shelleys personal crises of 1818 and 1819. The poem was completed in the summer of 1819 but was not published in Shelleys lifetime.Prometheus Unbound is a long dramatic poem inspired by Aeschyluss retelling of the Prometheus myth. It was completed in late 1819 and published in 1820.The Cenci is a verse drama of rape murder and incest based on the story of the Renaissance Count Cenci of Rome and his daughter Beatrice. Shelley completed the play in September and the first edition was published that year. It was to become one of his most popular works and the only one to have two authorised editions in his lifetime. The Shelleys were now living in Livorno where in September Shelley heard of the Peterloo Massacre of peaceful protesters in Manchester. Within two weeks he had completed one of his most famous political poems The Mask of Anarchy and despatched it to Leigh Hunt for publication. Hunt however decided not to publish it for fear of prosecution for seditious libel. The poem was only officially published in 1832. The Shelleys moved to Florence in October where Shelley read a scathing review of the Revolt of Islam in the conservative Quarterly Review. Shelley was angered by the personal attack on him in the article which he erroneously believed had been written by Southey. His bitterness over the review lasted for the rest of his life. On 12 November Mary gave birth to a boy Percy Florence Shelley. Around the time of Percys birth the Shelleys met Sophia Stacey who was a ward of one of Shelleys uncles and was staying at the same pension as the Shelleys. Sophia a talented harpist and singer formed a friendship with Shelley while Mary was preoccupied with her newborn son. Shelley wrote at least five love poems and fragments for Sophia including Song written for an Indian Air. The Shelleys moved to Pisa in January 1820 ostensibly to consult a doctor who had been recommended to them. There they became friends with the Irish republican Margaret Mason and her common-law husband George William Tighe. Mrs Mason became the inspiration for Shelleys poem The Sensitive Plant and Shelleys discussions with Mason and Tighe influenced his political thought and his critical interest in the population theories of Thomas Malthus. In March Shelley wrote to friends that Mary was depressed suicidal and hostile towards him. Shelley was also beset by financial worries as creditors from England pressed him for payment and he was obliged to make secret payments in connection with his Neapolitan charge Elena. Meanwhile Shelley was writing A Philosophical View of Reform a political essay which he had begun in Rome. The unfinished essay which remained unpublished in Shelleys lifetime has been called one of the most advanced and sophisticated documents of political philosophy in the nineteenth century. Another crisis erupted in June when Shelley claimed that he had been assaulted in the Pisan post office by a man accusing him of foul crimes. Shelleys biographer James Bieri suggests that this incident was possibly a delusional episode brought on by extreme stress as Shelley was being blackmailed by a former servant Paolo Foggi over baby Elena. It is likely that the blackmail was connected with a story spread by another former servant Elise Foggi that Shelley had fathered a child to Claire in Naples and had sent it to a foundling home. Shelley Claire and Mary denied this story and Elise later recanted. In July hearing that John Keats was seriously ill in England Shelley wrote to the poet inviting him to stay with him at Pisa. Keats replied with hopes of seeing him but instead arrangements were made for Keats to travel to Rome. Following the death of Keats in 1821 Shelley wrote Adonais which Harold Bloom considers one of the major pastoral elegies. The poem was published in Pisa in July 1821 but sold few copies. In early July 1820 Shelley heard that baby Elena had died on 9 June. In the months following the post office incident and Elenas death relations between Mary and Claire deteriorated and Claire spent most of the next two years living separately from the Shelleys mainly in Florence. That December Shelley met Teresa Viviani who was the 19-year-old daughter of the Governor of Pisa and was living in a convent awaiting a suitable marriage. Shelley visited her several times over the next few months and they started a passionate correspondence which dwindled after her marriage the following September. Emilia was the inspiration for Shelleys major poem Epipsychidion. In March 1821 Shelley completed A Defence of Poetry a response to Peacocks article The Four Ages of Poetry. Shelleys essay with its famous conclusion Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world remained unpublished in his lifetime. Shelley went alone to Ravenna in early August to see Byron making a detour to Livorno for a rendezvous with Claire. Shelley stayed with Byron for two weeks and invited the older poet to spend the winter in Pisa. After Shelley heard Byron read his newly completed fifth canto of Don Juan he wrote to Mary I despair of rivalling Byron. In November Byron moved into Villa Lanfranchi in Pisa just across the river from the Shelleys. Byron became the centre of the Pisan circle which was to include Shelley Thomas Medwin Edward Williams and Edward Trelawny. In the early months of 1822 Shelley became increasingly close to Jane Williams who was living with her partner Edward Williams in the same building as the Shelleys. Shelley wrote a number of love poems for Jane including The Serpent is shut out of Paradise and With a Guitar to Jane. Shelleys obvious affection for Jane was to cause increasing tension among Shelley Edward Williams and Mary. Claire arrived in Pisa in April at Shelleys invitation and soon after they heard that her daughter Allegra had died of typhus in Ravenna. The Shelleys and Claire then moved to Villa Magni near Lerici on the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Shelley acted as mediator between Claire and Byron over arrangements for the burial of their daughter and the added strain led to Shelley having a series of hallucinations. Mary almost died from a miscarriage on 16 June her life only being saved by Shelleys effective first aid. Two days later Shelley wrote to a friend that there was no sympathy between Mary and him and if the past and future could be obliterated he would be content in his boat with Jane and her guitar. That same day he also wrote to Trelawny asking for prussic acid. The following week Shelley woke the household with his screaming over a nightmare or hallucination in which he saw Edward and Jane Williams as walking corpses and himself strangling Mary. During this time Shelley was writing his final major poem the unfinished The Triumph of Life which Harold Bloom has called the most despairing poem he wrote. On 1 July 1822 Shelley and Edward Williams sailed in Shelleys new boat the Don Juan to Livorno where Shelley met Leigh Hunt and Byron in order to make arrangements for a new journal The Liberal. After the meeting on 8 July Shelley Williams and their boat boy sailed out of Livorno for Lerici. A few hours later the Don Juan and its inexperienced crew were lost in a storm. The vessel an open boat had been custom-built in Genoa for Shelley. Mary Shelley declared in her Note on Poems of 1822 that the design had a defect and that the boat was never seaworthy. In fact however the Don Juan was overmasted; the sinking was due to a severe storm and poor seamanship of the three men on board. Shelleys badly decomposed body washed ashore at Viareggio ten days later and was identified by Trelawny from the clothing and a copy of Keatss Lamia in a jacket pocket. On 16 August his body was cremated on a beach near Viareggio and the ashes were buried in the Protestant Cemetery of Rome. The day after the news of his death reached England the Tory London newspaper The Courier printed Shelley the writer of some infidel poetry has been drowned; now he knows whether there is God or no. Nothing of him that doth fadeBut doth suffer a sea changeInto something rich and strange. When Shelleys body was cremated on the beach his presumed heart resisted burning and was retrieved by Trelawny. The heart was possibly calcified from an earlier tubercular infection or was perhaps his liver. Trelawny gave the scorched organ to Hunt who preserved it in spirits of wine and refused to hand it over to Mary. He finally relented and the heart was eventually buried either at St Peters Church Bournemouth or in Christchurch Priory. Hunt also retrieved a piece of Shelleys jawbone which in 1913 was given to the Shelley-Keats Memorial in Rome. Shelleys paternal grandfather was Bysshe Shelley who in 1806 became Sir Bysshe Shelley First Baronet of Castle Goring. On Sir Bysshes death in 1815 Shelleys father inherited the baronetcy becoming Sir Timothy Shelley. Shelley was the eldest of several legitimate children. Bieri argues that Shelley had an older illegitimate brother but if he existed little is known of him. His younger siblings were John Margaret Hellen Mary Hellen and Elizabeth . Shelley had two children by his first wife Harriet Eliza Ianthe Shelley and Charles Bysshe Shelley . He had four children by his second wife Mary an unnamed daughter born in 1815 who only survived ten days; William Shelley ; Clara Everina Shelley ; and Percy Florence Shelley . Shelley also declared himself to be the father of Elena Adelaide Shelley who might have been an illegitimate or adopted daughter. His son Percy Florence became the third baronet of Castle Goring in 1844 following the death of Sir Timothy Shelley. Shelley was a political radical influenced by thinkers such as Rousseau Paine Godwin Wollstonecraft and Leigh Hunt. He advocated Catholic Emancipation republicanism parliamentary reform the extension of the franchise freedom of speech and peaceful assembly an end to aristocratic and clerical privilege and a more equal distribution of income and wealth. The views he expressed in his published works were often more moderate than those he advocated privately because of the risk of prosecution for seditious libel and his desire not to alienate more moderate friends and political allies. Nevertheless his political writings and activism brought him to the attention of the Home Office and he came under government surveillance at various periods. Shelleys most influential political work in the years immediately following his death was the poem Queen Mab which included extensive notes on political themes. The work went through 14 official and pirated editions by 1845 and became popular in Owenist and Chartist circles. His longest political essay A Philosophical View of Reform was written in 1820 but not published until 1920. Shelleys advocacy of nonviolent resistance was largely based on his reflections on the French Revolution and rise of Napoleon and his belief that violent protest would increase the prospect of a military despotism. Although Shelley sympathised with supporters of Irish independence such as Peter Finnerty and Robert Emmet he did not support violent rebellion. In his early pamphlet An Address to the Irish People he wrote I do not wish to see things changed now because it cannot be done without violence and we may assure ourselves that none of us are fit for any change however good if we condescend to employ force in a cause we think right. In his later essay A Philosophical View of Reform Shelley did concede that there were political circumstances in which force might be justified The last resort of resistance is undoubtably insurrection. The right of insurrection is derived from the employment of armed force to counteract the will of the nation. Shelley supported the 1820 armed rebellion against absolute monarchy in Spain and the 1821 armed Greek uprising against Ottoman rule. Shelleys poem The Mask of Anarchy has been called perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent resistance. Gandhi was familiar with the poem and it is possible that Shelley had an indirect influence on Gandhi through Henry David Thoreaus Civil Disobedience. Shelley was an avowed atheist who was influenced by the materialist arguments in Holbachs Le Système de la nature. His atheism was an important element of his political radicalism as he saw organised religion as inextricably linked to social oppression. The overt and implied atheism in many of his works raised a serious risk of prosecution for religious libel. His early pamphlet The Necessity of Atheism was withdrawn from sale soon after publication following a complaint from a priest. His poem Queen Mab which includes sustained attacks on the priesthood Christianity and religion in general was twice prosecuted by the Society for the Suppression of Vice in 1821. A number of his other works were edited before publication to reduce the risk of prosecution. Shelleys advocacy of free love drew heavily on the work of Mary Wollstonecraft and the early work of William Godwin. In his notes to Queen Mab he wrote A system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage. He argued that the children of unhappy marriages are nursed in a systematic school of ill-humour violence and falsehood. He believed that the ideal of chastity outside marriage was a monkish and evangelical superstition which led to the hypocrisy of prostitution and promiscuity. Shelley believed that sexual connection should be free among those who loved each other and last only as long as their mutual love. Love should also be free and not subject to obedience jealousy and fear. He denied that free love would lead to promiscuity and the disruption of stable human relationships arguing that relationships based on love would generally be of long duration and marked by generosity and self-devotion. When Shelleys friend T. J. Hogg made an unwanted sexual advance to Shelleys first wife Harriet Shelley forgave him of his horrible error and assured him that he was not jealous. It is very likely that Shelley encouraged Hogg and Shelleys second wife Mary to have a sexual relationship. Shelley converted to a vegetable diet in early March 1812 and sustained it with occasional lapses for the remainder of his life. Shelleys vegetarianism was influenced by ancient authors such as Hesiod Pythagoras Socrates Plato Ovid and Plutarch but more directly by John Frank Newton author of The Return to Nature or A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen . Shelley wrote two essays on vegetarianism A Vindication of Natural Diet and On the Vegetable System of Diet . Michael Owen Jones argues that Shelleys advocacy of vegetarianism was strikingly modern emphasising its health benefits the alleviation of animal suffering the inefficient use of agricultural land involved in animal husbandry and the economic inequality resulting from the commercialisation of animal food production. Shelleys life and works inspired the founding of the Vegetarian Society in England and directly influenced the vegetarianism of George Bernard Shaw and perhaps Gandhi. Shelleys work was not widely read in his lifetime outside a small circle of friends poets and critics. Most of his poetry drama and fiction was published in editions of 250 copies which generally sold poorly. Only The Cenci went to an authorised second edition while Shelley was alive in contrast Byrons The Corsair sold out its first edition of 10000 copies in one day. The initial reception of Shelleys work in mainstream periodicals was generally unfavourable. Reviewers often launched personal attacks on Shelleys private life and political social and religious views even when conceding that his poetry contained beautiful imagery and poetic expression. There was also criticism of Shelleys intelligibility and style Hazlitt describing it as a passionate dream a straining after impossibilities a record of fond conjectures a confused embodying of vague abstraction. Shelleys poetry soon gained a wider audience in radical and reformist circles. Queen Mab became popular with Owenists and Chartists and Revolt of Islam influenced poets sympathetic to the workers movement such as Thomas Hood Thomas Cooper and William Morris. However Shelleys mainstream following did not develop until a generation after his death. Bieri argues that editions of Shelleys poems published in 1824 and 1839 were edited by Mary Shelley to highlight her late husbands lyrical gifts and downplay his radical ideas.Matthew Arnold famously described Shelley as a beautiful and ineffectual angel. Shelley was a major influence on a number of important poets in the following decades including Robert Browning Algernon Swinburne Thomas Hardy and William Butler Yeats. Shelley-like characters frequently appeared in nineteenth-century literature; they include Scythrop in Thomas Love Peacocks Nightmare Abbey Ladislaw in George Eliots Middlemarch and Angel Clare in Hardys Tess of the dUrbervilles. Twentieth-century critics such as Eliot Leavis Allen Tate and Auden variously criticised Shelleys poetry for deficiencies in style repellent ideas and immaturity of intellect and sensibility. However Shelleys critical reputation began to rise in the 1960s as a new generation of critics highlighted Shelleys debt to Spenser and Milton his mastery of genres and verse forms and the complex interplay of sceptical idealist and materialist ideas in his work. American literary critic Harold Bloom describes him as a superb craftsman a lyric poet without rival and surely one of the most advanced sceptical intellects ever to write a poem. According to Donald H. Reiman Shelley belongs to the great tradition of Western writers that includes Dante Shakespeare and Milton. Shelley died leaving many of his works unfinished unpublished or published in expurgated versions with multiple errors. There have been a number of recent projects aimed at establishing reliable editions of his manuscripts and works. Among the most notable of these are Shelleys long-lost Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things was rediscovered in 2006 and subsequently made available online by the Bodleian Library in Oxford. John Lauritsen have argued that Shelleys contribution to Mary Shelleys novel Frankenstein was extensive and that he should be considered a collaborator or co-author. Professor Charlotte Gordon and others have disputed this contention.Fiona Sampson has said In recent years Percys corrections visible in the Frankenstein notebooks held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford have been seized on as evidence that he must have at least co-authored the novel. In fact when I examined the notebooks myself I realised that Percy did rather less than any line editor working in publishing today. The KeatsShelley Memorial Association founded in 1903 supports the KeatsShelley House in Rome which is a museum and library dedicated to the Romantic writers with a strong connection with Italy. The association is also responsible for maintaining the grave of Percy Bysshe Shelley in the non-Catholic Cemetery at Testaccio. The association publishes the scholarly KeatsShelley Review. It also runs the annual KeatsShelley and Young Romantics Writing Prizes and the KeatsShelley Fellowship. Works are listed by estimated year of composition. The year of first publication is given when this is different. Source is Bieri unless otherwise indicated.
John Clare,John Clare was an English poet. The son of a farm labourer he became known for his celebrations of the English countryside and sorrows at its disruption. His work underwent major re-evaluation in the late 20th century; he is now often seen as a major 19th-century poet. His biographer Jonathan Bate called Clare the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature of a rural childhood and of the alienated and unstable self. Clare was born in Helpston 6 miles to the north of the city of Peterborough. In his lifetime the village was in the Soke of Peterborough in Northamptonshire and his memorial calls him The Northamptonshire Peasant Poet. Helpston is now part of the City of Peterborough unitary authority. Clare became an agricultural labourer while still a child but attended school in Glinton church until he was 12. In his early adult years Clare became a potboy in the Blue Bell public house and fell in love with Mary Joyce but her father a prosperous farmer forbade them to meet. Later he was a gardener at Burghley House. He enlisted in the militia tried camp life with Gypsies and worked in Pickworth Rutland as a lime burner in 1817. In the following year he was obliged to accept parish relief. Malnutrition stemming from childhood may have been the main factor behind his five-foot stature and contributed to his poor physical health in later life. Clare had bought a copy of James Thomsons The Seasons and began to write poems and sonnets. In an attempt to hold off his parents eviction from their home Clare offered his poems to a local bookseller Edward Drury who sent them to his cousin John Taylor of the Taylor Hessey firm which had published the work of John Keats. Taylor published Clares Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery in 1820. The book was highly praised and the next year his Village Minstrel and Other Poems appeared. There was no limit to the applause bestowed upon Clare unanimous in their admiration of a poetical genius coming before them in the humble garb of a farm labourer. On 16 March 1820 Clare married Martha Turner a milkmaid in the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Great Casterton. An annuity of 15 guineas from the Marquess of Exeter in whose service he had been was supplemented by subscription so that Clare gained 45 a year a sum far beyond what he had ever earned. Soon however his income became insufficient and in 1823 he was nearly penniless. The Shepherds Calendar met with little success which was not increased by his hawking it himself. As he worked again in the fields his health temporarily improved; but he soon became seriously ill. Earl Fitzwilliam presented him with a new cottage and a piece of ground but Clare could not settle down. Clare was constantly torn between the two worlds of literary London and his often illiterate neighbours between a need to write poetry and a need for money to feed and clothe his children. His health began to suffer and he had bouts of depression which worsened after his sixth child was born in 1830 and as his poetry sold less well. In 1832 his friends and London patrons clubbed together to move the family to a larger cottage with a smallholding in the village of Northborough not far from Helpston. However he only felt more alienated there. Clares last work the Rural Muse was noticed favourably by Christopher North and other reviewers but its sales were not enough to support his wife and seven children. Clares mental health began to worsen. His alcohol consumption steadily increased along with dissatisfaction with his own identity and more erratic behaviour. A notable instance was his interruption of a performance of The Merchant of Venice in which Clare verbally assaulted Shylock. He was becoming a burden to Patty and his family and in July 1837 on the recommendation of his publishing friend John Taylor Clare went of his own volition to Dr Matthew Allens private asylum High Beach near Loughton in Epping Forest. Taylor had assured Clare that he would receive the best medical care. Clare was reported as being full of many strange delusions. He believed himself to be a prize fighter and that he had two wives Patty and Mary. He started to claim he was Lord Byron. Allen wrote about Clare to The Times in 1840 It is most singular that ever since he came... the moment he gets pen or pencil in hand he begins to write most poetical effusions. Yet he has never been able to obtain in conversation nor even in writing prose the appearance of sanity for two minutes or two lines together and yet there is no indication of insanity in any of his poetry. Clare was an Anglican. Whatever he may have felt about liturgy and ministry and however critical an eye he may have cast on parish life Clare retained and replicated his fathers loyalty to the Church of England. He dodged services in his youth and dawdled in the fields during the hours of worship but he derived much help in later years from members of the clergy. He acknowledged that his father was brought up in the communion of the Church of England and I have found no cause to withdraw myself from it. If he found aspects of the established church uncongenial and awkward he remained prepared to defend it Still I reverence the church and do from my soul as much as anyone curse the hand thats lifted to undermine its constitution. Much of Clares imagery was drawn from the Old Testament . However Clare also honours the figure of Christ in poems such as The Stranger. During his early asylum years in High Beach Essex Clare re-wrote poems and sonnets by Lord Byron. Child Harold his version of Byrons Childe Harolds Pilgrimage became a lament for past lost love and Don Juan A Poem an acerbic misogynistic sexualised rant redolent of an ageing dandy. Clare also took credit for Shakespeares plays claiming to be him. Im John Clare now the poet told a newspaper editor I was Byron and Shakespeare formerly. In July 1841 Clare absconded from the asylum in Essex and walked some 80 miles home believing he was to meet his first love Mary Joyce to whom he was convinced he was married. He did not believe her family when they told him she had died accidentally three years earlier in a house fire. He remained free mostly at home in Northborough for the five months following but eventually Patty called the doctors. Between Christmas and New Year 1841 Clare was committed to Northampton General Lunatic Asylum . On his arrival at the asylum the accompanying doctor Fenwick Skrimshire having treated Clare since 1820 completed the admission papers. Asked Was the insanity preceded by any severe or long-continued mental emotion or exertion Skrimshire entered After years of poetical prosing. His maintenance at the asylum was paid for by Earl Fitzwilliam but at the ordinary rate for poor people. He remained there for the rest of his life under the humane regime of Thomas Octavius Prichard who encouraged and helped him to write. Here he wrote possibly his most famous poem I Am. It was in this later poetry that Clare developed a very distinctive voice an unmistakable intensity and vibrance such as the later pictures of Van Gogh possessed. John Clare died of a stroke on 20 May 1864 in his 71st year. His remains were returned to Helpston for burial in St Botolphs churchyard where he had expressed a wish to be buried. On Clares birthday children at the John Clare School Helpstons primary parade through the village and place their midsummer cushions around his gravestone which bears the inscriptions To the Memory of John Clare The Northamptonshire Peasant Poet and A Poet is Born not Made. In his time Clare was commonly known as the Northamptonshire Peasant Poet. His formal education was brief his other employment and class origins lowly. Clare resisted the use of the increasingly standardised English grammar and orthography in his poetry and prose alluding to political reasoning in comparing grammar to tyrannical government and slavery personifying it in jocular fashion as a bitch. He wrote in Northamptonshire dialect introducing local words to the literary canon such as pooty lady-cow crizzle and throstle . It is common to see an absence of punctuation in Clares original writings although many publishers felt the need to remedy this in most of his work. Clare argued with his editors about how it should be presented to the public. Clare grew up in a time of massive changes in town and countryside as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. Many former agricultural and craft workers including children moved from the countryside to crowded cities as factory work mechanized. The Agricultural Revolution saw pastures ploughed up trees and hedges uprooted fens drained and commons enclosed. This destruction of an ancient way of life distressed Clare. His political and social views were mainly conservative. He refused even to complain of the subordinate position to which English society had placed him swearing that with the old dish that was served to my forefathers I am content. His early work expresses delight in nature and the cycle of the rural year. Poems such as Winter Evening Haymaking and Wood Pictures in Summer mark the beauty of the world and the certainties of rural life where animals must be fed and crops harvested. Poems such as Little Trotty Wagtail show his sharp observation of wildlife though The Badger shows a lack of sentiment about the place of animals in the countryside. At this time he often used poetic forms such as the sonnet and the rhyming couplet. His later poetry tends to be more meditative and use forms similar to the folk songs and ballads of his youth. An example of this is Evening. Clares knowledge of the natural world went far beyond that of the major Romantic poets. However poems such as I Am show a metaphysical depth parallel with his contemporary poets and many of his pre-asylum poems deal with intricate play on the nature of linguistics. His birds nest poems it can be argued display the self-awareness and obsession with the creative process that captivated the romantics. Clare was the most influential poet apart from Wordsworth to prefer an older style. In a foreword to the 2011 anthology The Poetry of Birds the broadcaster and bird-watcher Tim Dee notes that Clare wrote about 147 species of British wild birds without any technical kit whatsoever. The only Clare essay to appear in his lifetime was Popularity of Authorship which described anonymously his predicament in 1824. Other essays by Clare to appear posthumously were Essays on Landscape Essays on Criticism and Fashion Recollections on a Journey from Essex Excursions with an Angler For Essay on Modesty and Mock Morals For Essay on Industry Keats Byron The Dream House or Window Flies and Dewdrops. Clare was relatively forgotten in the later 19th century but interest in his work was revived by Arthur Symons in 1908 Edmund Blunden in 1920 and John and Anne Tibble in their ground-breaking 1935 two-volume edition while in 1949 Geoffrey Grigson edited as Poems of John Clares Madness . Benjamin Britten set some of May from A Shepherds Calendar in his Spring Symphony of 1948 and included a setting of The Evening Primrose in his Five Flower Songs. Copyright on much of his work was claimed after 1965 by the editor of the Complete Poetry Professor Eric Robinson but this has been contested. Recent publishers such as Faber and Carcanet have refused to acknowledge it and it seems the copyright is defunct. The largest collection of original Clare manuscripts is held at Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery where items are available to view by appointment. Altering what Clare actually wrote continued into the later 20th century. Helen Gardner for instance amended both the punctuation and the spelling and grammar when editing the New Oxford Book of English Verse 12501950 . Since 1993 the John Clare Society of North America has organised an annual session of scholarly papers concerning John Clare at the annual Convention of the Modern Language Association of America. In 2003 the scholar Jonathan Bate published the first major critical biography of Clare which helped to keep up the revival in popular and academic interest. The thatched cottage where Clare was born was bought by the John Clare Trust in 2005. In May 2007 the Trust gained 1.27 million of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and commissioned Jefferson Sheard Architects to create a new landscape design and visitor centre including a cafe shop and exhibition area. The cottage at 12 Woodgate Helpston has been restored using traditional building methods and is open to the public. In 2013 the John Clare Trust received a further grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help preserve the building and provide educational activities for youngsters visiting it. Clares father was according to Clare a noted singer and Clare himself played the fiddle and collected folk songs and tunes. Regarding his fiddle playing ability he described himself as a decent scraper and collected over two-hundred folk tunes in two books the Northampton Manuscripts Nos. 12 and 13. As well as collecting folk tunes Clare also collected many folk songs which are recorded in the Northampton Manuscript No. 18 and the Peterborough Manuscripts B4 and B7. According to George Deacon the Northampton Manuscript No. 18 contains more polished and refined versions of songs which were originally written up in a rougher form in the two Peterborough Manuscripts B4 and B7. Deacons research led him to view the two Peterborough manuscripts as more authentic inasmuch as they showed less conscious interference from the poet in Clare than the versions of the songs in the Northampton manuscript. Since Clares death many of his poems have been set to music by classical composers and more recently by contemporary singersongwriters working in the acoustic and folk genres. However at least one of Clares poems was set to music in his lifetime although Clare arrived in London too late to attend the performance. According to Professor Simon Kövesi The Meeting ... Clares first poem to be set to music and performed on stage. The performance by singer Madame Vestris was at Drury Lane Theatre on 19 February 1820; the song was threaded into the pasticcio opera The Siege of Belgrade. Clare just missed the show arriving in London for his first visit to the capital a short while after. Clare wrote that on the night we got into London it was announcd in the Play Bills that a song of mine was to be sung at Covent Garden by Madam Vestris and we was to have gone but it was too late. I felt uncommonly pleasd at the circumstance. The Catalogue of the John Clare Collection in the Northampton Public Library with Indexes to the Poems in Manuscript was compiled by David Powell and published by the County Borough of Northampton Public Libraries Museums and Art Gallery Committee in 1964. Included in the catalogue are the two books of folk tunes and the book of folk songs . Contents consist of eighty-eight titles but the tunes are without words and directions. The titles are noted down in Clares hand. This is No. 109 in the Peterborough Centenary Catalogue. Contents consist of 180 titles. Directions for some of the country dances are given in abbreviated form but the only words given are those for Black Eyd Susan and Dibdins The Sailors Journal. The titles are noted down in Clares hand. A few fragmentary lines of verse are scribbled inside the back cover. This is No. 108 in the Peterborough Centenary Catalogue. The introduction begins I commenced sometime ago with an intention of making a collection of old Ballads . . . and contents include John Randall The Maidens Welcome The False Knights Tradegy Loves Riddles Banks of Ivory etc. There is an additional poem Round Oak in pencil and several of the blank pages at the end contain traces of pencil writing which has been erased. This is No. 98 in the Peterborough Centenary Catalogue.
Felicia Hemans,Felicia Dorothea Hemans was an English poet . Two of her opening lines The boy stood on the burning deck and The stately homes of England have acquired classic status. Felicia Dorothea Browne was the daughter of George Browne who worked for his father-in-laws wine importing business and succeeded him as Tuscan and imperial consul in Liverpool and Felicity daughter of Benedict Paul Wagner wine importer at 9 Wolstenholme Square Liverpool and Venetian consul for that city. Hemans was the fourth of six children to survive infancy. Her sister Harriett collaborated musically with Hemans and later edited her complete works . George Brownes business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales where she spent her youth. They lived in a cottage within the grounds of Gwrych Castle near Abergele when Felicia was seven years old until she was sixteen and later moved to Bronwylfa St. Asaph ; she later called Wales Land of my childhood my home and my dead. Lydia Sigourney says of her education  Hemans was proficient in Welsh French German Italian Spanish and Portuguese. Her sister Harriet remarked that One of her earliest tastes was a passion for Shakspeare which she read as her choicest recreation at six years old. Hemans first poems dedicated to the Prince of Wales were published in Liverpool in 1808 when she was fourteen arousing the interest of poet Percy Bysshe Shelley who briefly corresponded with her. She quickly followed them up with England and Spain and The Domestic Affections .  From Casabianca The boy stood on the burning deckWhence all but he had fled;The flame that lit the battles wreckShone round him oer the dead.Yet beautiful and bright he stoodAs born to rule the storm;A creature of heroic bloodA proud though childlike form. Hemans major collections including The Forest Sanctuary Records of Woman and Songs of the Affections were popular especially with female readers. Her last books sacred and profane were Scenes and Hymns of Life and National Lyrics and Songs for Music. She was by now a well-known literary figure highly regarded by contemporaries such as Wordsworth and with a popular following in the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1812 she married Captain Alfred Hemans an Irish army officer some years older than herself. The marriage took her away from Wales to Daventry in Northamptonshire until 1814. During their first six years of marriage Hemans gave birth to five sons including G. W. Hemans and Charles Isidore Hemans and then the couple separated. Marriage had not however prevented her from continuing her literary career with several volumes of poetry being published by the respected firm of John Murray in the period after 1816 beginning with The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy and Modern Greece . Tales and Historic Scenes was the collection which came out in 1819 the year of their separation. From 1831 Hemans lived in Dublin. At her death of dropsy William Wordsworth Letitia Elizabeth Landon Lydia Huntley Sigourney and Walter Savage Landor composed memorial verses in her honour. She is buried in St. Anns Church Dawson Street. Hemanss works appeared in nineteen individual books during her lifetime. After her death in 1835 they were republished widely usually as collections of individual lyrics and not the longer annotated works and integrated series that made up her books. For surviving female poets such as Caroline Norton and Letitia Elizabeth Landon Lydia Sigourney and Frances Harper the French Amable Tastu and German Annette von Droste-Hülshoff she was a valued model. To many readers she offered a womans voice confiding a womans trials; to others a lyricism consonant with Victorian sentimentality. Among the works she valued most were the unfinished Superstition and Revelation and the pamphlet The Sceptic which sought an Anglicanism more attuned to world religions and womens experiences. In her most successful book Records of Woman she chronicles the lives of women both famous and anonymous. Hemans poem The Homes of England is the origin of the phrase stately home referring to an English country house. From The Homes of EnglandThe stately Homes of EnglandHow beautiful they standAmidst their tall ancestral treesOer all the pleasant land;The deer across their greensward boundThrough shade and sunny gleamAnd the swan glides past them with the soundOf some rejoicing stream.The free fair Homes of EnglandLong long in hut and hallMay hearts of native proof be rearedTo guard each hallowed wallAnd green forever be the grovesAnd bright the flowery sodWhere first the childs glad spirit lovesIts country and its God. Despite her illustrious admirers her stature as a serious poet gradually declined partly due to her success in the literary marketplace. Her poetry was considered morally exemplary and was often assigned to schoolchildren; as a result Hemans came to be seen as more a poet for children rather than on the basis of her entire body of work. Schoolchildren in the U.S. were still being taught The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers in New England in the middle of the 20th century. But by the 21st century The Stately Homes of England refers to Noël Cowards parody not to the once-famous poem it parodied. However her critical reputation has been re-examined in recent years. Her work has resumed a role in standard anthologies and in classrooms and seminars and literary studies especially in the US. Other anthologised poems include The Image in Lava Evening Prayer at a Girls School I Dream of All Things Free Night-Blowing Flowers Properzia Rossi A Spirits Return The Bride of the Greek Isle The Wife of Asdrubal The Widow of Crescentius The Last Song of Sappho Corinne at the Capitol and The Coronation Of Inez De Castro. First published in August 1826 the poem Casabianca by Hemans depicts Captain Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca and his 12-year-old son Giocante who both perished aboard the ship Orient during the Battle of the Nile. The poem was very popular from the 1850s on and was memorized in elementary schools for literary practice. Other poetic figures such as Elizabeth Bishop and Samuel Butler allude to the poem in their own works. The poem is sung in ballad form and consists of a boy asking his father whether he had fulfilled his duties as the ship continues to burn until the magazine catches fire. Hemans adds the following note to the poem Young Casabianca a boy about thirteen years old son to the Admiral of the Orient remained at his post after the ship had taken fire and all the guns had been abandoned and perished in the explosion of the vessel when the flames had reached the powder. Martin Gardner Michael R. Turner and others wrote modern-day parodies that were much more upbeat and consisted of boys stuffing their faces with peanuts and bread. This contrasted sharply with the dramatic image created in Casabianca as Hemans wrote it. Her second book England and Spain or Valour and Patriotism was published in 1808 and was a narrative poem honouring her brother and his military service in the Peninsular War. The poem called for an end to the tyranny of Napoleon Bonaparte and for a long-lasting peace. Multiple references to Albion an older name for Great Britain emphasize Hemanss patriotism. Several of Hemanss characters take their own lives rather than suffer the social political and personal consequences of their compromised situations. At Hemanss time women writers were often torn between a choice of home or the pursuit of a literary career. Hemans herself was able to balance both roles without much public ridicule but left hints of discontent through the themes of feminine death in her writing. The suicides of women in Hemanss poetry dwell on the same social issue that was confronted both culturally and personally during her life the choice of caged domestication or freedom of thought and expression. Coeur De Lion At The Bier Of His FatherTorches were blazing clearHymns pealing deep and slowWhere a king lay stately on his bierIn the church of Fontevraud.As if each deeply furrowed traceOf earthly years to show - Alas that sceptred mortals raceHad surely closed in woeAnd the holy chant was hushed awhileAs by the torchs flameA gleam of arms up the sweeping aisle With a mail-clad leader came. He came with haughty lookAn eagle-glance and clear;But his proud heart through its breast-plate shookWhen he stood beside the bier Oh father is it vainThis late remorse and deepSpeak to me father once againI weep - behold I weepAlas my guilty pride and ireWere but this work undoneI would give Englands crown my sireTo hear thee bless thy son. Thou that my boyhoods guideDidst take fond joy to be - The times Ive sported at thy sideAnd climbed thy parent kneeAnd there before the blessed shrineMy sire I see thee lie - How will that sad still face of thineLook on me till I die From the Coeur De Lion At The Bier Of His Father poem
John Keats,John Keats was an English poet of the second generation of Romantic poets along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. His poems had been in publication for less than four years when he died of tuberculosis at the age of 25. They were indifferently received in his lifetime but his fame grew rapidly after his death. By the end of the century he was placed in the canon of English literature strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1888 called one ode one of the final masterpieces. Jorge Luis Borges named his first time reading Keats an experience he felt all his life. Keats had a style heavily loaded with sensualities notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics he accentuated extreme emotion through natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature in particular Ode to a Nightingale Ode on a Grecian Urn Sleep and Poetry and the sonnet On First Looking into Chapmans Homer. John Keats was born in Moorgate London on 31 October 1795 to Thomas and Frances Keats . There is little evidence of his exact birthplace. Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29 October baptism records give the date as the 31st. He was the eldest of four surviving children; his younger siblings were George Thomas and Frances Mary Fanny who later married the Spanish author Valentín Llanos Gutiérrez. Another son was lost in infancy. His father first worked as a ostler at the stables attached to the Swan and Hoop Inn owned by his father-in-law John Jennings an establishment he later managed and where the growing family lived for some years. Keats believed he was born at the inn a birthplace of humble origins but there is no evidence to support this. The Globe pub now occupies the site a few yards from modern Moorgate station. Keats was baptised at St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate and sent to a local dame school as a child. His parents wished to send their sons to Eton or Harrow but the family decided they could not afford the fees. In the summer of 1803 John was sent to board at John Clarkes school in Enfield close to his grandparents house. The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger more prestigious schools. In the family atmosphere at Clarkes Keats developed an interest in classics and history which would stay with him throughout his short life. The headmasters son Charles Cowden Clarke also became an important mentor and friend introducing Keats to Renaissance literature including Tasso Spenser and Chapmans translations. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character always in extremes given to indolence and fighting. However at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809. In April 1804 when Keats was eight his father died from a skull fracture after falling from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school. Thomas Keats died intestate. Frances remarried two months later but left her new husband soon afterwards and the four children went to live with a grandmother Alice Jennings in the village of Edmonton. In March 1810 when Keats was 14 his mother died of tuberculosis leaving the children in their grandmothers custody. She appointed two guardians Richard Abbey and John Sandell for them. That autumn Keats left Clarkes school to be an apprentice with Thomas Hammond a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery at 7 Church Street until 1813. Cowden Clarke who remained close to Keats called this period the most placid time in Keats life. From 1814 Keats had two bequests held in trust for him until his 21st birthday. 800 was willed by his grandfather John Jennings. Also Keatss mother left a legacy of 8000 to be equally divided among her living children. It seems he was not told of the 800 and probably knew nothing of it as he never applied for it. Historically blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian but he may also have been unaware of it. William Walton solicitor for Keatss mother and grandmother definitely knew and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not though it would have made a critical difference to the poets expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently. On First Looking into Chapmans HomerMuch have I travelld in the realms of goldAnd many goodly states and kingdoms seen;Round many western islands have I beenWhich bards in fealty to Apollo hold.Oft of one wide expanse had I been toldThat deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;Yet did I never breathe its pure sereneTill I heard Chapman speak out loud and boldThen felt I like some watcher of the skiesWhen a new planet swims into his ken;Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyesHe stard at the Pacific and all his menLookd at each other with a wild surmise Silent upon a peak in Darien. The sonnet On First Looking into Chapmans HomerOctober 1816 In October 1815 having finished his five-year apprenticeship with Hammond Keats registered as a medical student at Guys Hospital and began studying there. Within a month he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital assisting surgeons during operations the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; and it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload. Keatss long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guys Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine assuring financial security and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor. He lodged near the hospital at 28 St Thomass Street in Southwark with other medical students including Henry Stephens who gained fame as an inventor and ink magnate. Keatss training took up increasing amounts of his writing time and he became increasingly ambivalent about it. He felt he was facing a stark choice. He had written his first extant poem An Imitation of Spenser in 1814 when he was 19. Now strongly drawn by ambition inspired by fellow poets such as Leigh Hunt and Lord Byron and beleaguered by family financial crises he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John feared that he should never be a poet if he was not he would destroy himself. In 1816 Keats received his apothecarys licence which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary physician and surgeon but before the end of the year he had informed his guardian that he resolved to be a poet not a surgeon. Although he continued his work and training at Guys Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature experimenting with verse forms particularly the sonnet. In May 1816 Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet O Solitude in his magazine The Examiner a leading liberal magazine of the day. This was the first appearance of Keatss poetry in print; Charles Cowden Clarke called it his friends red letter day first proof that Keats ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was To My Brothers. That summer Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of Margate to write. There he began Calidore and initiated an era of great letter writing. On returning to London he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street Southwark and braced himself to study further for membership of the Royal College of Surgeons. In October 1816 Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of Poems the first volume of Keatss verse which included I stood tiptoe and Sleep and Poetry both strongly influenced by Hunt. The book was a critical failure arousing little interest although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in The Champion. Clarke commented that the book might have emerged in Timbuctoo. Keatss publishers Charles and James Ollier felt ashamed of it. Keats immediately changed publishers to Taylor and Hessey in Fleet Street. Unlike the Olliers Keatss new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of Poems they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the companys rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists came to include Coleridge Hazlitt Clare Hogg Carlyle and Charles Lamb. Through Taylor and Hessey Keats met their Eton-educated lawyer Richard Woodhouse who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by Poems. Although he noted that Keats could be wayward trembling easily daunted Woodhouse was convinced of Keatss genius a poet to support as he became one of Englands greatest writers. Soon after they met the two became close friends and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana documenting as much as he could about the poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keatss work. Andrew Motion represents him as Boswell to Keatss Johnson ceaselessly promoting his work fighting his corner and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years Woodhouse was one of the few to accompany Keats to Gravesend Kent to embark on his final trip to Rome. Despite the bad reviews of Poems Hunt published the essay Three Young Poets and the sonnet On First Looking into Chapmans Homer foreseeing great things to come. He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle including the editor of The Times Thomas Barnes; the writer Charles Lamb; the conductor Vincent Novello; and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds who would become a close friend. Keats also met regularly with William Hazlitt a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed a new school of poetry. At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Hearts affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth. This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of Ode on a Grecian Urn Beauty is truth truth beauty that is all Ye know on earth and all ye need to know. In early December 1816 under the heady influence of his artistic friends Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry to Abbeys fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness made large loans to friends such as the painter Benjamin Haydon. Keats would go on to lend 700 to his brother George. By lending so much Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts. Having left his training at the hospital suffering from a succession of colds and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of Hampstead in April 1817. There John and George nursed their tubercular brother Tom. The house was close to Hunt and others of his circle in Hampstead and to Coleridge respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets then living in Highgate. On 11 April 1818 Keats reported that he and Coleridge had taken a long walk on Hampstead Heath. In a letter to his brother George he wrote that they had talked about a thousand things ... nightingales poetry poetical sensation metaphysics. Around this time he was introduced to Charles Wentworth Dilke and James Rice. In June 1818 Keats began a walking tour of Scotland Ireland and the Lake District with Charles Armitage Brown. Keatss brother George and his wife Georgina accompanied them to Lancaster and then continued to Liverpool from where they migrated to America living in Ohio and Louisville Kentucky until 1841 when Georges investments failed. Like Keatss other brother they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis for which there was no effective treatment until the next century. In July while on the Isle of Mull Keats caught a bad cold and was too thin and fevered to proceed on the journey. After returning south in August Keats continued to nurse Tom so exposing himself to infection. Some have suggested this was when tuberculosis his family disease took hold. Consumption was not identified as a disease with a single infectious origin until 1820. There was considerable stigma attached to it as it was often tied with weakness repressed sexual passion or masturbation. Keats refuses to give it a name in his letters. Tom Keats died on 1 December 1818. John Keats moved to the newly built Wentworth Place owned by his friend Charles Armitage Brown. It was on the edge of Hampstead Heath ten minutes walk south of his old home in Well Walk. The winter of 181819 though a difficult period for the poet marked the beginning of his annus mirabilis in which he wrote his most mature work. He had been inspired by a series of recent lectures by Hazlitt on English poets and poetic identity and had also met Wordsworth. Keats may have seemed to his friends to be living on comfortable means but in reality he was borrowing regularly from Abbey and his friends. He composed five of his six great odes at Wentworth Place in April and May and although it is debated in which order they were written Ode to Psyche opened the published series. According to Brown Ode to a Nightingale was composed under a plum tree in the garden. Brown wrote In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry I found those scraps four or five in number contained his poetic feelings on the song of our nightingale. Dilke co-owner of the house strenuously denied the story printed in Richard Monckton Milnes 1848 biography of Keats dismissing it as pure delusion. My heart aches and a drowsy numbness painsMy sense as though of hemlock I had drunkOr emptied some dull opiate to the drainsOne minute past and Lethe-wards had sunkTis not through envy of thy happy lotBut being too happy in thine happiness That thou light-winged Dryad of the treesIn some melodious plotOf beechen green and shadows numberlessSingest of summer in full-throated ease. In 1819 Keats wrote The Eve of St. Agnes La Belle Dame sans Merci Hyperion Lamia and a play Otho the Great . The poems Fancy and Bards of passion and of mirth were inspired by the garden of Wentworth Place. In September very short of money and in despair considering taking up journalism or a post as a ships surgeon he approached his publishers with a new book of poems. They were unimpressed with the collection finding the presented versions of Lamia confusing and describing St Agnes as having a sense of pettish disgust and a Don Juan style of mingling up sentiment and sneering concluding it was a poem unfit for ladies. The final volume Keats lived to see Lamia Isabella The Eve of St. Agnes and Other Poems was eventually published in July 1820. It received greater acclaim than had Endymion or Poems finding favourable notices in both The Examiner and Edinburgh Review. It would come to be recognised as one of the most important poetic works ever published. Keats befriended Isabella Jones in May 1817 while on holiday in the village of Bo Peep near Hastings. She is described as beautiful talented and widely read not of the top flight of society yet financially secure an enigmatic figure who would become a part of Keatss circle. Throughout their friendship Keats never hesitated to own his sexual attraction to her although they seemed to enjoy circling each other rather than offering commitment. He writes that he frequented her rooms in the winter of 181819 and in his letters to George says that he warmed with her and kissed her. The trysts may have been a sexual initiation for Keats according to Bate and Robert Gittings. Jones inspired and was a steward of Keatss writing. The themes of The Eve of St. Agnes and The Eve of St Mark may well have been suggested by her the lyric Hush Hush was about her and that the first version of Bright Star may have originally been for her. In 1821 Jones was one of the first in England to be notified of Keatss death. Letters and drafts of poems suggest that Keats first met Frances Brawne between September and November 1818. It is likely that the 18-year-old Brawne visited the Dilke family at Wentworth Place before she lived there. She was born in the hamlet of West End on 9 August 1800. Like Keatss grandfather her grandfather kept a London inn and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keatss sister and mother and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent. During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats whom John was nursing through this period. On 3 April 1819 Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilkes Wentworth Place and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books such as Dantes Inferno and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet Bright Star as a declaration. It was a work in progress which he continued until the last months of his life and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. All his desires were concentrated on Fanny. From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones. Sometime before the end of June he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer with no prospects and financial stricture. Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his star began to gnaw at him. Darkness disease and depression surrounded him reflected in poems such as The Eve of St. Agnes and La Belle Dame sans Merci where love and death both stalk. I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks; he wrote to her your loveliness and the hour of my death. In one of his many hundreds of notes and letters Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819 My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again my Life seems to stop there I see no further. You have absorbd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you... I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion I have shudderd at it I shudder no more I could be martyrd for my Religion Love is my religion I could die for that I could die for you. Tuberculosis took hold and he was advised by his doctors to move to a warmer climate. In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters although he did correspond with her mother. He died there five months later. None of Brawnes letters to Keats survive. It took a month for the news of his death to reach London after which Brawne stayed in mourning for six years. In 1833 more than 12 years after his death she married and went on to have three children; she outlived Keats by more than 40 years. During 1820 Keats displayed increasingly serious symptoms of tuberculosis suffering two lung haemorrhages in the first few days of February. On first coughing up blood on 3 February 1820 he said to Charles Armitage Brown I know the colour of that blood It is arterial blood. I cannot be deceived in that colour. That drop of blood is my death warrant. I must die. He lost large amounts of blood and was bled further by the attending physician. Hunt nursed him in London for much of the following summer. At the suggestion of his doctors he agreed to move to Italy with his friend Joseph Severn. On 13 September they left for Gravesend and four days later boarded the sailing brig Maria Crowther. On 1 October the ship landed at Lulworth Bay or Holworth Bay where the two went ashore; back on board ship he made the final revisions of Bright Star. The journey was a minor catastrophe storms broke out followed by a dead calm that slowed the ships progress. When they finally docked in Naples the ship was held in quarantine for ten days due to a suspected outbreak of cholera in Britain. Keats reached Rome on 14 November by which time any hope of the warmer climate he sought had disappeared. Keats wrote his last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad that I feel it worse on opening any book yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past and that I am leading a posthumous existence. On arrival in Italy he moved into a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome today the KeatsShelley Memorial House museum. Despite care from Severn and Dr. James Clark his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical attention Keats received may have hastened his death. In November 1820 Clark declared that the source of his illness was mental exertion and that the source was largely situated in his stomach. Clark eventually diagnosed consumption and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach. He also bled the poet a standard treatment of the day but also likely a significant contributor to Keatss weakness. Severns biographer Sue Brown writes They could have used opium in small doses and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didnt realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldnt let him have it. Then in Rome he tried again.... Severn was in such a quandary he didnt know what to do so in the end he went to the doctor who took it away. As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing to ease the pain at all. Keats was angry with both Severn and Clark when they would not give him laudanum . He repeatedly demanded How long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on The first months of 1821 marked a slow and steady decline into the final stage of tuberculosis. His autopsy showed his lung almost disintegrated. Keats was coughing up blood and covered in sweat. Severn nursed him devotedly and observed in a letter how Keats would sometimes cry upon waking to find himself still alive. Severn writes Keats raves till I am in a complete tremble for him... about four the approaches of death came on. Severn I lift me up I am dying I shall die easy; dont be frightened be firm and thank God it has come. I lifted him up in my arms. The phlegm seemd boiling in his throat and increased until eleven when he gradually sank into death so quiet that I still thought he slept. John Keats died in Rome on 23 February 1821. His body was buried in the citys Protestant Cemetery. His last request was to be placed under a tombstone bearing no name or date only the words Here lies One whose Name was writ in Water. Severn and Brown erected the stone which under a relief of a lyre with broken strings includes the epitaph  This Grave contains all that was Mortal of a YOUNG ENGLISH POET Who on his Death Bed in the Bitterness of his Heart at the Malicious Power of his Enemies Desired these Words to be engraven on his Tomb Stone Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water Feb 24th 1821 Francis Beaumont also used the expression in The Nice Valour Act 5 scene 5  All your better deeds Shall be in water writ but this in marble. Severn and Brown added their lines to the stone in protest at the critical reception of Keatss work. Hunt blamed his death on the Quarterly Reviews scathing attack of Endymion. As Byron quipped in his narrative poem Don Juan; Seven weeks after the funeral Shelley memorialised Keats in his poem Adonais. Clark saw to a planting of daisies on the grave saying Keats would have wished it. For public health reasons the Italian health authorities burnt the furniture in Keatss room scraped the walls and made new windows doors and flooring. The ashes of Shelley one of Keatss most fervent champions are buried in the cemetery and Joseph Severn is buried next to Keats. On the site today Marsh wrote In the old part of the graveyard barely a field when Keats was buried here there are now umbrella pines myrtle shrubs roses and carpets of wild violets. When Keats died at 25 he had been writing poetry seriously for only about six years from 1814 until the summer of 1820 and publishing for only four. In his lifetime sales of Keatss three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies. His first poem the sonnet O Solitude appeared in the Examiner in May 1816 while his collection Lamia Isabella The Eve of St. Agnes and other poems was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome. The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keatss work. Although prolific during his short career and now one of the most studied and admired British poets his reputation rests on a small body of work centred on the Odes and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820 I have left no immortal work behind me nothing to make my friends proud of my memory but I have lovd the principle of beauty in all things and if I had had time I would have made myself rememberd. Keatss ability and talent was acknowledged by several influential contemporary allies such as Shelley and Hunt. His admirers praised him for thinking on his pulses for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities more gorgeous in its effects more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him loading every rift with ore. Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome and loudly declared that Keatss death had been brought on by bad reviews in the Quarterly Review. Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote Adonais a despairing elegy stating that Keatss early death was a personal and public tragedy The loveliest and the lastThe bloom whose petals nipped before they blewDied on the promise of the fruit. Although Keats wrote that if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye. His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke who first introduced him to the classics and also came from the predilections of Hunts Examiner which Keats read as a boy. Hunt scorned the Augustan or French school dominated by Pope and attacked earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge now in their forties as unsophisticated obscure and crude writers. Indeed during Keatss few years as a published poet the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work identifying himself with a new school for a time somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth Coleridge and Byron and providing a basis for scathing attacks from Blackwoods and the Quarterly Review. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulnessClose bosom-friend of the maturing sunConspiring with him how to load and blessWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;To bend with apples the mossd cottage-treesAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;To swell the gourd and plump the hazel shellsWith a sweet kernel; to set budding moreAnd still more later flowers for the beesUntil they think warm days will never ceaseFor Summer has oer-brimmd their clammy cells. By his death Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools the obscurity of first-wave Romantics and uneducated affectation of Hunts Cockney School. Keatss posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of a hyper-sensitive genius killed by high feeling which Shelley later portrayed. The Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted. Marked as the standard-bearer of sensory writing his reputation grew steadily and remarkably. His work had the full support of the influential Cambridge Apostles whose members included the young Tennyson later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century.Constance Naden was a great admirer of his poems arguing that his genius lay in his exquisite sensitiveness to all the elements of beauty. In 1848 twenty-seven years after Keatss death Richard Monckton Milnes published the first full biography which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood including Millais and Rossetti were inspired by Keats and painted scenes from his poems including The Eve of St. Agnes Isabella and La Belle Dame sans Merci lush arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keatss work. In 1882 Swinburne wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica that the Ode to a Nightingale one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages. In the 20th century Keats remained the muse of poets such as Wilfred Owen who kept his death date as a day of mourning Yeats and T. S. Eliot. Critic Helen Vendler stated the odes are a group of works in which the English language finds an ultimate embodiment.Bate said of To Autumn Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English and M. R. Ridley said the ode is the most serenely flawless poem in our language. The largest collection of the letters manuscripts and other papers of Keats is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Other collections of material are archived at the British Library Keats House Hampstead the KeatsShelley Memorial House in Rome and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Since 1998 the British Keats-Shelley Memorial Association have annually awarded a prize for romantic poetry. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1896 to commemorate Keats at Keats House. Jorge Luis Borges named his first encounter with Keats an experience he felt all his life. None of Keatss biographies were written by people who had known him. Shortly after his death his publishers announced they would speedily publish The memoirs and remains of John Keats but his friends refused to cooperate and argued with each other to such an extent that the project was abandoned. Leigh Hunts Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries gives the first biographical account strongly emphasising Keatss supposedly humble origins a misconception which still continues. Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles a succession of other publications followed including anthologies of his many notes chapters and letters. However early accounts often gave contradictory or biased versions of events and were subject to dispute. His friends Brown Severn Dilke Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey his publisher Taylor Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keatss life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend. Shelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony who was spiritualised by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive suffering image popularly held today. The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin Robert Gittings Walter Jackson Bate Aileen Ward and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity. John Keats His Life and Death the first major motion picture about the life of Keats was produced in 1973 by Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. It was directed by John Barnes. John Stride played John Keats and Janina Faye played Fanny Brawne. The 2009 film Bright Star written and directed by Jane Campion focuses on Keatss relationship with Fanny Brawne. Inspired by the 1997 Keats biography penned by Andrew Motion it stars Ben Whishaw as Keats and Abbie Cornish as Fanny. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage wrote I speak as someone... to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Keatss death. It was first published in The Times on 20 February 2021. In 2007 a sculpture of Keats seated on bench by sculptor Stuart Williamson at Guys and Saint Thomas Hospital London was unveiled by the Poet Laureate Andrew Motion. Keatss letters were first published in 1848 and 1878. Critics in the 19th century disregarded them as distractions from his poetic works but in the 20th century they became almost as admired and studied as his poetry and are highly regarded in the canon of English literary correspondence.T. S. Eliot called them certainly the most notable and most important ever written by any English poet. Keats spent much time considering poetry itself its constructs and impacts displaying a deep interest unusual in his milieu who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics fashions or science. Eliot wrote of Keatss conclusions; There is hardly one statement of Keats about poetry which... will not be found to be true and what is more true for greater and more mature poetry than anything Keats ever wrote. Few of Keatss letters remain from the period before he joined his literary circle. From spring 1817 however there is a rich record of his prolific and impressive letter-writing skills. He and his friends poets critics novelists and editors wrote to each other daily and Keatss ideas are bound up in the ordinary his day-to-day missives sharing news parody and social commentary. They glitter with humour and critical intelligence. Born of an unself-conscious stream of consciousness they are impulsive full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots. When his brother George went to America Keats wrote to him in detail the body of letters becoming the real diary and self-revelation of Keatss life as well as an exposition of his philosophy with the first drafts of poems containing some of Keatss finest writing and thought. Gittings sees them as akin to a spiritual journal not written for a specific other so much as for synthesis. Keats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry. Specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe. In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters. Writing to his brother George Keats explored the idea of the world as the vale of Soul-making anticipating the great odes he wrote some months later. In the letters Keats coined ideas such as the Mansion of Many Apartments and the Chameleon Poet which came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination though only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence. The poetical mind Keats argued He used the term negative capability to discuss the state of being in which we are capable of being in uncertainties Mysteries doubts without any irritable reaching after fact reason.... content with half knowledge where one trusts in the hearts perceptions. He wrote later he was certain of nothing but the holiness of the Hearts affections and the truth of Imagination What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth whether it existed before or not for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime creative of essential Beauty constantly returning to what it means to be a poet. My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk Keats notes to Shelley. In September 1819 Keats wrote to Reynolds How beautiful the season is now How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it.... I never likd the stubbled fields as much as now Aye better than the chilly green of spring. Somehow the stubble plain looks warm in the same way as some pictures look warm this struck me so much in my Sundays walk that I composed upon it. The final stanza of his last great ode To Autumn runs Where are the songs of Spring Ay where are theyThink not of them thou hast thy music too While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying dayAnd touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue; There are areas of his life and daily routine that Keats omits. He mentions little of his childhood or his financial straits being seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is no reference to his parents. In his last year as his health deteriorated his concerns often give way to despair and morbid obsessions. His letters to Fanny Brawne published in 1870 focus on the period and emphasise its tragic aspect giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.
John Stuart Mill,John Stuart Mill was an English philosopher political economist politician and civil servant. One of the most influential thinkers in the history of classical liberalism he contributed widely to social theory political theory and political economy. Dubbed the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy he conceived of liberty as justifying the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control. Mill was a proponent of utilitarianism an ethical theory developed by his predecessor Jeremy Bentham. He contributed to the investigation of scientific methodology though his knowledge of the topic was based on the writings of others notably William Whewell John Herschel and Auguste Comte and research carried out for Mill by Alexander Bain. He engaged in written debate with Whewell. A member of the Liberal Party and author of the early feminist work The Subjection of Women Mill was also the second member of Parliament to call for womens suffrage after Henry Hunt in 1832. John Stuart Mill was born at 13 Rodney Street in Pentonville then on the edge of the capital and now in central London the eldest son of Harriet Barrow and the Scottish philosopher historian and economist James Mill. John Stuart was educated by his father with the advice and assistance of Jeremy Bentham and Francis Place. He was given an extremely rigorous upbringing and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings. His father a follower of Bentham and an adherent of associationism had as his explicit aim to create a genius intellect that would carry on the cause of utilitarianism and its implementation after he and Bentham had died. Mill was a notably precocious child. He describes his education in his autobiography. At the age of three he was taught Greek. By the age of eight he had read Aesops Fables Xenophons Anabasis and the whole of Herodotus and was acquainted with Lucian Diogenes Laërtius Isocrates and six dialogues of Plato. He had also read a great deal of history in English and had been taught arithmetic physics and astronomy. At the age of eight Mill began studying Latin the works of Euclid and algebra and was appointed schoolmaster to the younger children of the family. His main reading was still history but he went through all the commonly taught Latin and Greek authors and by the age of ten could read Plato and Demosthenes with ease. His father also thought that it was important for Mill to study and compose poetry. One of his earliest poetic compositions was a continuation of the Iliad. In his spare time he also enjoyed reading about natural sciences and popular novels such as Don Quixote and Robinson Crusoe. His fathers work The History of British India was published in 1818; immediately thereafter at about the age of twelve Mill began a thorough study of the scholastic logic at the same time reading Aristotles logical treatises in the original language. In the following year he was introduced to political economy and studied Adam Smith and David Ricardo with his father ultimately completing their classical economic view of factors of production. Mills comptes rendus of his daily economy lessons helped his father in writing Elements of Political Economy in 1821 a textbook to promote the ideas of Ricardian economics; however the book lacked popular support. Ricardo who was a close friend of his father used to invite the young Mill to his house for a walk to talk about political economy. At the age of fourteen Mill stayed a year in France with the family of Sir Samuel Bentham brother of Jeremy Bentham and in the company of George Ensor then pursuing his polemic against the political economy of Thomas Malthus. The mountain scenery he saw led to a lifelong taste for mountain landscapes. The lively and friendly way of life of the French also left a deep impression on him. In Montpellier he attended the winter courses on chemistry zoology logic of the Faculté des Sciences as well as taking a course in higher mathematics. While coming and going from France he stayed in Paris for a few days in the house of the renowned economist Jean-Baptiste Say a friend of Mills father. There he met many leaders of the Liberal party as well as other notable Parisians including Henri Saint-Simon. Mill went through months of sadness and contemplated suicide at twenty years of age. According to the opening paragraphs of Chapter V of his autobiography he had asked himself whether the creation of a just society his lifes objective would actually make him happy. His heart answered no and unsurprisingly he lost the happiness of striving towards this objective. Eventually the poetry of William Wordsworth showed him that beauty generates compassion for others and stimulates joy. With renewed vigour he continued to work towards a just society but with more relish for the journey. He considered this one of the most pivotal shifts in his thinking. In fact many of the differences between him and his father stemmed from this expanded source of joy. Mill met Thomas Carlyle during one of the latters visits to London in the early 1830s and the two quickly became companions and correspondents. Mill offered to print Carlyles works at his own expense and encouraged Carlyle to write his French Revolution supplying him with materials in order to do so. In March 1835 while the manuscript of the completed first volume was in Mills possession Mills housemaid unwittingly used it as tinder destroying all except some three or four bits of leaves. Mortified Mill offered Carlyle 200 as compensation . Ideological differences would put an end to the friendship during the 1840s though Carlyles early influence on Mill would colour his later thought. Mill had been engaged in a pen-friendship with Auguste Comte the founder of positivism and sociology since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comtes sociologie was more an early philosophy of science than modern sociology is. Comtes positivism motivated Mill to eventually reject Benthams psychological egoism and what he regarded as Benthams cold abstract view of human nature focused on legislation and politics instead coming to favour Comtes more sociable view of human nature focused on historical facts and directed more towards human individuals in all their complexities. As a nonconformist who refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England Mill was not eligible to study at the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge. Instead he followed his father to work for the East India Company and attended University College London to hear the lectures of John Austin the first Professor of Jurisprudence. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1856. Mills career as a colonial administrator at the East India Company spanned from when he was 17 years old in 1823 until 1858 when the companys territories in India were directly annexed by the Crown establishing direct Crown control over India. In 1836 he was promoted to the companys political department where he was responsible for correspondence pertaining to the companys relations with the princely states and in 1856 was finally promoted to the position of Examiner of Indian Correspondence. In On Liberty A Few Words on Non-Intervention and other works he opined that To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject. Mill viewed places such as India as having once been progressive in their outlook but had now become stagnant in their development; he opined that this meant these regions had to be ruled via a form of benevolent despotism...provided the end is improvement. When the Crown proposed to take direct control over the territories of the East India Company Mill was tasked with defending Company rule and penned Memorandum on the Improvements in the Administration of India during the Last Thirty Years among other petitions. He was offered a seat on the Council of India the body created to advise the new Secretary of State for India but declined citing disapproval of the new system of administration in India. On 21 April 1851 Mill married Harriet Taylor after 21 years of intimate friendship. Taylor was married when they met and their relationship was close but generally believed to be chaste during the years before her first husband died in 1849. The couple waited two years before marrying in 1851. Accomplished in her own right Taylor was a significant influence on Mills work and ideas during both friendship and marriage. His relationship with Taylor reinforced Mills advocacy of womens rights. He said that in his stand against domestic violence and for womens rights he was chiefly an amanuensis to my wife. He called her mind a perfect instrument and said she was the most eminently qualified of all those known to the author. He cites her influence in his final revision of On Liberty which was published shortly after her death. Taylor died in 1858 after developing severe lung congestion after only seven years of marriage to Mill. Between the years 1865 and 1868 Mill served as Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews. At his inaugural address delivered to the University on 1 February 1867 he made the now-famous remark that Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends than that good men should look on and do nothing. That Mill included that sentence in the address is a matter of historical record but it by no means follows that it expressed a wholly original insight. During the same period 186568 he was also a Member of Parliament for City of Westminster. He was sitting for the Liberal Party. During his time as an MP Mill advocated easing the burdens on Ireland. In 1866 he became the first person in the history of Parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote vigorously defending this position in subsequent debate. He also became a strong advocate of such social reforms as labour unions and farm cooperatives. In Considerations on Representative Government he called for various reforms of Parliament and voting especially proportional representation the single transferable vote and the extension of suffrage. In April 1868 he favoured in a Commons debate the retention of capital punishment for such crimes as aggravated murder; he termed its abolition an effeminacy in the general mind of the country. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1867. He was godfather to the philosopher Bertrand Russell. In his views on religion Mill was an agnostic and a sceptic. Mill died in 1873 thirteen days before his 67th birthday of erysipelas in Avignon France where his body was buried alongside his wifes. Mill joined the debate over scientific method which followed on from John Herschels 1830 publication of A Preliminary Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy which incorporated inductive reasoning from the known to the unknown discovering general laws in specific facts and verifying these laws empirically. William Whewell expanded on this in his 1837 History of the Inductive Sciences from the Earliest to the Present Time followed in 1840 by The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences Founded Upon their History presenting induction as the mind superimposing concepts on facts. Laws were self-evident truths which could be known without need for empirical verification. Mill countered this in 1843 in A System of Logic . In Mills Methods as in Herschels laws were discovered through observation and induction and required empirical verification. Matilal remarks that Dignāga analysis is much like John Stuart Mills Joint Method of Agreement and Difference which is inductive. He suggested that it is very likely that during his stay in India he may have come across the tradition of logic on which scholars started taking interest after 1824 though it is unknown whether it influenced his work or not. Mills On Liberty addresses the nature and limits of the power that can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. Mills idea is that only if a democratic society follows the Principle of Liberty can its political and social institutions fulfill their role of shaping national character so that its citizens can realise the permanent interests of people as progressive beings . Mill states the Principle of Liberty as the sole end for which mankind are warranted individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection. The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community against his will is to prevent harm to others. His own good either physical or moral is not a sufficient warrant. One way to read Mills Principle of Liberty as a principle of public reason is to see it excluding certain kinds of reasons from being taken into account in legislation or in guiding the moral coercion of public opinion. . These reasons include those founded in other persons good; reasons of excellence and ideals of human perfection; reasons of dislike or disgust or of preference. Mill states that harms which may be prevented include acts of omission as well as acts of commission. Thus failing to rescue a drowning child counts as a harmful act as does failing to pay taxes or failing to appear as a witness in court. All such harmful omissions may be regulated according to Mill. By contrast it does not count as harming someone ifwithout force or fraudthe affected individual consents to assume the risk thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others provided there is no deception involved.  The question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions whether of omission or commission constitute harmful actions subject to regulation continues to exercise interpreters of Mill. He did not consider giving offence to constitute harm; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society. Mill believed that the struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history. For him liberty in antiquity was a contestbetween subjects or some classes of subjects and the government. Mill defined social liberty as protection from the tyranny of political rulers. He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take referred to as social tyranny and tyranny of the majority. Social liberty for Mill meant putting limits on the rulers power so that he would not be able to use that power to further his own wishes and thus make decisions that could harm society. In other words people should have the right to have a say in the governments decisions. He said that social liberty was the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. It was attempted in two ways first by obtaining recognition of certain immunities ; and second by establishment of a system of constitutional checks. Society can and does execute its own mandates and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression since though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties it leaves fewer means of escape penetrating much more deeply into the details of life and enslaving the soul itself. Mills view on liberty which was influenced by Joseph Priestley and Josiah Warren is that individuals ought to be free to do as they wished unless they caused harm to others. Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well being. Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society. Mill explained The sole end for which mankind are warranted individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others. His own good either physical or moral is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so because it will make him happier because in the opinion of others to do so would be wise or even right. The only part of the conduct of anyone for which he is amenable to society is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns him his independence is of right absolute. Over himself over his own body and mind the individual is sovereign. On Liberty involves an impassioned defense of free speech. Mill argues that free discourse is a necessary condition for intellectual and social progress. We can never be sure he contends that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth. He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons. First individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas. Second by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate these beliefs are kept from declining into mere dogma. It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one. Along those same lines Mill wrote unmeasured vituperation employed on the side of prevailing opinion really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions and from listening to those who express them. As an influential advocate of freedom of speech Mill objected to censorship I choose by preference the cases which are least favourable to meIn which the argument opposing freedom of opinion both on truth and that of utility is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality ... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question for others without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However positive anyones persuasion may be not only of the faculty but of the pernicious consequences but the immorality and impiety of opinion.yet if in pursuance of that private judgement though backed by the public judgement of his country or contemporaries he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal. Mill outlines the benefits of searching for and discovering the truth as a way to further knowledge. He argued that even if an opinion is false the truth can be better understood by refuting the error. And as most opinions are neither completely true nor completely false he points out that allowing free expression allows the airing of competing views as a way to preserve partial truth in various opinions. Worried about minority views being suppressed he argued in support of freedom of speech on political grounds stating that it is a critical component for a representative government to have to empower debate over public policy. He also eloquently argued that freedom of expression allows for personal growth and self-realization. He said that freedom of speech was a vital way to develop talents and realise a persons potential and creativity. He repeatedly said that eccentricity was preferable to uniformity and stagnation. The belief that freedom of speech would advance society presupposed a society sufficiently culturally and institutionally advanced to be capable of progressive improvement. If any argument is really wrong or harmful the public will judge it as wrong or harmful and then those arguments cannot be sustained and will be excluded. Mill argued that even any arguments which are used in justifying murder or rebellion against the government should not be politically suppressed or socially persecuted. According to him if rebellion is really necessary people should rebel; if murder is truly proper it should be allowed. However the way to express those arguments should be a public speech or writing not in a way that causes actual harm to others. Such is the harm principle That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others. At the beginning of the 20th century Associate justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made the standard of clear and present danger based on Mills idea. In the majority opinion Holmes writes Holmes suggested that falsely shouting out Fire in a dark theatre which evokes panic and provokes injury would be such a case of speech that creates an illegal danger. But if the situation allows people to reason by themselves and decide to accept it or not any argument or theology should not be blocked. Mills argument is now generally accepted by many democratic countries and they have laws at least guided by the harm principle. For example in American law some exceptions limit free speech such as obscenity defamation breach of peace and fighting words. In On Liberty Mill thought it was necessary for him to restate the case for press freedom. He considered that argument already won. Almost no politician or commentator in mid-19th-century Britain wanted a return to Tudor and Stuart-type press censorship. However Mill warned new forms of censorship could emerge in the future. Indeed in 2013 the Cameron Tory government considered setting up a so-called independent official regulator of the UK press. This prompted demands for better basic legal protection of press freedom. A new British Bill of Rights could include a US-type constitutional ban on governmental infringement of press freedom and block other official attempts to control freedom of opinion and expression. To suppose that the same international customs and the same rules of international morality can obtain between one civilized nation and another and between civilized nations and barbarians is a grave error. To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject. In 1850 Mill sent an anonymous letter in rebuttal to Thomas Carlyles letter to Frasers Magazine for Town and Country in which Carlyle argued for slavery. Mill supported abolishing slavery in the United States expressing his opposition to slavery in his essay of 1869 The Subjection of Women This absolutely extreme case of the law of force condemned by those who can tolerate almost every other form of arbitrary power and which of all others presents features the most revolting to the feeling of all who look at it from an impartial position was the law of civilized and Christian England within the memory of persons now living and in one half of Anglo-Saxon America three or four years ago not only did slavery exist but the slave trade and the breeding of slaves expressly for it was a general practice between slave states. Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it but in England at least a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it than of any other of the customary abuses of force for its motive was the love of gain unmixed and undisguised and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it was unmitigated abhorrence. I cannot look forward with satisfaction to any settlement but complete emancipationland given to every negro family either separately or in organized communities under such rules as may be found temporarily necessarythe schoolmaster set to work in every village the tide of free immigration turned on in those fertile regions from which slavery has hitherto excluded it. If this be done the gentle docile character which seems to distinguish the negroes will prevent any mischief on their side while the proofs they are giving of fighting powers will do more in a year than all other things in a century to make the whites respect them consent to their being politically socially equals. Mills view of history was that right up until his time the whole of the female and the great majority of the male sex were simply slaves. He countered arguments to the contrary arguing that relations between sexes simply amounted to the legal subordination of one sex to the other is wrong itself and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality. Here then we have an instance of Mills use of slavery in a sense which compared to its fundamental meaning of absolute unfreedom of person is an extended and arguably a rhetorical rather than a literal sense. With this Mill can be considered among the earliest male proponents of gender equality having been recruited by American feminist John Neal during his stay in London circa 18251827. His book The Subjection of Women is one of the earliest written on this subject by a male author. In The Subjection of Women Mill attempts to make a case for perfect equality. In his proposal for a universal education system sponsored by the state Mill expands benefits for many marginalized groups especially for women. For Mill a universal education held the potential to create new abilities and novel types of behavior of which the current receiving generation and their descendants could both benefit from. Such a pathway to opportunity would enable women to gain industrial and social independence that would allow them the same movement in their agency and citizenship as men.Mills view of opportunity stands out in its reach but even more so for the population he foresees who could benefit from it. Mill was hopeful of the autonomy such an education could allow for its recipients and especially for women. Through the consequential sophistication and knowledge attained individuals are able to properly act in ways that recedes away from those leading towards overpopulation.This stands directly in contrast with the view held by many of Mills contemporaries and predecessors who viewed such inclusive programs to be counter intuitive. Aiming such help at marginalized groups such as the poor and working class would only serve to reward them with the opportunity to move to a higher status thus encouraging greater fertility which at its extreme could lead to overproduction. He talks about the role of women in marriage and how it must be changed. Mill comments on three major facets of womens lives that he felt are hindering them He argues that the oppression of women was one of the few remaining relics from ancient times a set of prejudices that severely impeded the progress of humanity. As a Member of Parliament Mill introduced an unsuccessful amendment to the Reform Bill to substitute the word person in place of man. The canonical statement of Mills utilitarianism can be found in his book Utilitarianism. Although this philosophy has a long tradition Mills account is primarily influenced by Jeremy Bentham and Mills father James Mill. John Stuart Mill believed in the philosophy of utilitarianism which he would describe as the principle that holds that actions are right in the proportion as they tend to promote happiness wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness he means intended pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness pain and the privation of pleasure. It is clear that we do not all value virtues as a path to happiness and that we sometimes only value them for selfish reasons. However Mill asserts that upon reflection even when we value virtues for selfish reasons we are in fact cherishing them as a part of our happiness. Benthams famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the greatest-happiness principle. It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings within reason. In a similar vein Mills method of determining the best utility is that a moral agent when given the choice between two or more actions ought to choose the action that contributes most to the total happiness in the world. Happiness in this context is understood as the production of pleasure or privation of pain. Given that determining the action that produces the most utility is not always so clear cut Mill suggests that the utilitarian moral agent when attempting to rank the utility of different actions should refer to the general experience of persons. That is if people generally experience more happiness following action X than they do action Y the utilitarian should conclude that action X produces more utility than action Y and so is to be preferred. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory meaning that it holds that acts are justified insofar as they produce a desirable outcome. The overarching goal of utilitarianismthe ideal consequenceis to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number as the end result of human action. In Utilitarianism Mill states that happiness is the sole end of human action. This statement aroused some controversy which is why Mill took it a step further explaining how the very nature of humans wanting happiness and who take it to be reasonable under free consideration demands that happiness is indeed desirable. In other words free will leads everyone to make actions inclined on their own happiness unless reasoned that it would improve the happiness of others in which case the greatest utility is still being achieved. To that extent the utilitarianism that Mill is describing is a default lifestyle that he believes is what people who have not studied a specific opposing field of ethics would naturally and subconsciously use when faced with a decision. Utilitarianism is thought of by some of its activists to be a more developed and overarching ethical theory of Immanuel Kants belief in goodwill and not just some default cognitive process of humans. Where Kant would argue that reason can only be used properly by goodwill Mill would say that the only way to universally create fair laws and systems would be to step back to the consequences whereby Kants ethical theories become based around the ultimate goodutility. By this logic the only valid way to discern what is the proper reason would be to view the consequences of any action and weigh the good and the bad even if on the surface the ethical reasoning seems to indicate a different train of thought. Mills major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures are superior to more physical forms of pleasure . He distinguishes between happiness and contentment claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool or the pig are of a different opinion it is because they only know their own side of the question. This made Mill believe that our only ultimate end is happiness. One unique part of his utilitarian view that is not seen in others is the idea of higher and lower pleasures. Mill explains the different pleasures as If I am asked what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures or what makes one pleasure more valuable than another merely as a pleasure except its being greater in amount there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference that is the more desirable pleasure. He defines higher pleasures as mental moral and aesthetic pleasures and lower pleasures as being more sensational. He believed that higher pleasures should be seen as preferable to lower pleasures since they have a greater quality in virtue. He holds that pleasures gained in activity are of a higher quality than those gained passively. Mill defines the difference between higher and lower forms of pleasure with the principle that those who have experienced both tend to prefer one over the other. This is perhaps in direct contrast with Benthams statement that Quantity of pleasure being equal push-pin is as good as poetry that if a simple childs game like hopscotch causes more pleasure to more people than a night at the opera house it is more incumbent upon a society to devote more resources to propagating hopscotch than running opera houses. Mills argument is that the simple pleasures tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art and are therefore not in a proper position to judge. He also argues that people who for example are noble or practise philosophy benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure which are lower forms of happiness. It is not the agents own greatest happiness that matters but the greatest amount of happiness altogether. Mill separated his explanation of Utilitarianism into five different sections In the General Remarks portion of his essay he speaks how next to no progress has been made when it comes to judging what is right and what is wrong of morality and if there is such a thing as moral instinct . However he agrees that in general Our moral faculty according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to the name of thinkers supplies us only with the general principles of moral judgments. In What Utilitarianism Is he focuses no longer on background information but utilitarianism itself. He quotes utilitarianism as The greatest happiness principle defining this theory by saying that pleasure and no pain are the only inherently good things in the world and expands on it by saying that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness pain and the privation of pleasure. He views it not as an animalistic concept because he sees seeking out pleasure as a way of using our higher facilities. He also says in this chapter that the happiness principle is based not exclusively on the individual but mainly on the community. Mill also defends the idea of a strong utilitarian conscience . He argued that humans have a desire to be happy and that that desire causes us to want to be in unity with other humans. This causes us to care about the happiness of others as well as the happiness of complete strangers. But this desire also causes us to experience pain when we perceive harm to other people. He believes in internal sanctions that make us experience guilt and appropriate our actions. These internal sanctions make us want to do good because we do not want to feel guilty for our actions. Happiness is our ultimate end because it is our duty. He argues that we do not need to be constantly motivated by the concern of peoples happiness because most of the actions done by people are done out of good intention and the good of the world is made up of the good of the people. In Mills fourth chapter Of What Sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible he speaks of what proofs of Utility are affected. He starts this chapter off by saying that all of his claims cannot be backed up by reasoning. He claims that the only proof that something brings one pleasure is if someone finds it pleasurable. Next he talks about how morality is the basic way to achieve happiness. He also discusses in this chapter that Utilitarianism is beneficial for virtue. He says that it maintains not only that virtue is to be desired but that it is to be desired disinterestedly for itself. In his final chapter he looks at the connection between Utilitarianism and justice. He contemplates the question of whether justice is something distinct from Utility or not. He reasons this question in several different ways and finally comes to the conclusion that in certain cases justice is essential for Utility but in others social duty is far more important than justice. Mill believes that justice must give way to some other moral principle but that what is just in ordinary cases is by reason of that other principle not just in the particular case. The qualitative account of happiness that Mill advocates thus sheds light on his account presented in On Liberty. As he suggests in that text utility is to be conceived in relation to humanity as a progressive being which includes the development and exercise of rational capacities as we strive to achieve a higher mode of existence. The rejection of censorship and paternalism is intended to provide the necessary social conditions for the achievement of knowledge and the greatest ability for the greatest number to develop and exercise their deliberative and rational capacities. Mill redefines the definition of happiness as the ultimate end for the sake of which all other things are desirable is an existence as free as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments. He firmly believed that moral rules and obligations could be referenced to promoting happiness which connects to having a noble character. While Mill is not a standard act utilitarian or rule utilitarian he is a minimizing utilitarian which affirms that it would be desirable to maximize happiness for the greatest number but not that we are morally required to do so. Mill believed that for the majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness scrutiny self-interrogation dwelling on thinking about imagining or questioning on ones happiness. Then if otherwise fortunately circumstanced one would inhale happiness with the air you breathe. Mills early economic philosophy was one of free markets. However he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare. He originally believed that equality of taxation meant equality of sacrifice and that progressive taxation penalized those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a mild form of robbery. Given an equal tax rate regardless of income Mill agreed that inheritance should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goessome charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others. Later he altered his views toward a more socialist bent adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes. Within this revised work he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained albeit altered in the third edition of the Principles of Political Economy to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured and those on earned incomes which he did not favour. In his autobiography Mill stated that in relation to his later views on political economy his ideal of ultimate improvement... would class decidedly under the general designation of Socialists. His views shifted partly due to reading the works of utopian socialists but also from the influence of Harriet Taylor. In his work Socialism Mill argued that the prevalence of poverty in contemporary industrial capitalist societies was pro tanto a failure of the social arrangements and that attempts to condone this state of affairs as being the result of individual failings did not represent a justification of them but instead were an irresistible claim upon every human being for protection against suffering. Mills Principles first published in 1848 was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period. As Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations had during an earlier period Principles came to dominate economics teaching. In the case of Oxford University it was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by Marshalls Principles of Economics. Karl Marx in his critique of political economy mentioned Mill in the Grundrisse. Marx contended that Mills thinking posited the categories of capital in an ahistorical fashion. Mills main objection to Marxism focused on what he saw its destruction of competition. He wrote I utterly dissent from the most conspicuous and vehement part of their teachingtheir declamations against competition. Though he was an egalitarian Mill argued more for equal opportunity and placed meritocracy above all other ideals in this regard. He further argued that a socialist society would only be attainable through the provision of basic education for all promoting economic democracy instead of capitalism in the manner of substituting capitalist businesses with worker cooperatives. He says The form of association however which if mankind continue to improve must be expected in the end to predominate is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief and work-people without a voice in the management but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations and working under managers elected and removable by themselves. Mills major work on political democracy Considerations on Representative Government defends two fundamental principles extensive participation by citizens and enlightened competence of rulers. The two values are obviously in tension and some readers have concluded that he is an elitist democrat while others count him as an earlier participatory democrat. In one section he appears to defend plural voting in which more competent citizens are given extra votes . However in another chapter he argues cogently for the value of participation by all citizens. He believed that the incompetence of the masses could eventually be overcome if they were given a chance to take part in politics especially at the local level. Mill is one of the few political philosophers ever to serve in government as an elected official. In his three years in Parliament he was more willing to compromise than the radical principles expressed in his writing would lead one to expect. Mill was a major proponent of the diffusion and use of public education to the working class. He saw the value of the individual person and believed that man had the inherent capability of guiding his own destiny-but only if his faculties were developed and fulfilled which could be achieved through education. He regarded education as a pathway to improve human nature which to him meant to encourage among other characteristics diversity and originality the energy of character initiative autonomy intellectual cultivation aesthetic sensibility non-self-regarding interests prudence responsibility and self-control. Education allowed for humans to develop into full informed citizens that had the tools to improve their condition and make fully informed electoral decisions. The power of education lay in its ability to serve as a great equalizer among the classes allowing the working class the ability to control their own destiny and compete with the upper classes. Mill recognised the paramount importance of public education in avoiding the tyranny of the majority by ensuring that all the voters and political participants were fully developed individuals. It was through education he believed that an individual could become a full participant within representative democracy. In regards to higher education Mill defended liberal education against contemporary arguments for models of higher education focused on religion or science. His 1867 St. Andrews Address called on elites educated in reformed universities to work towards education policy committed to liberal principles. In Principles of Political Economy Mill offered an analysis of two economic phenomena often linked together the laws of production and wealth and the modes of its distribution. Regarding the former he believed that it was not possible to alter to laws of production the ultimate properties of matter and mind... only to employ these properties to bring about events we are interested. The modes of distribution of wealth is a matter of human institutions solely starting with what Mill believed to be the primary and fundamental institution Individual Property. He believed that all individuals must start on equal terms with division of the instruments of production fairly among all members of society. Once each member has an equal amount of individual property they must be left to their own exertion not to be interfered with by the state. Regarding inequality of wealth Mill believed that it was the role of the government to establish both social and economic policies that promote the equality of opportunity. The government according to Mill should implement three tax policies to help alleviate poverty Inheritance of capital and wealth plays a large role in development of inequality because it provides greater opportunity for those receiving the inheritance. Mills solution to inequality of wealth brought about by inheritance was to implement a greater tax on inheritances because he believed the most important authoritative function of the government is taxation and taxation judiciously implemented could promote equality. Mill demonstrated an early insight into the value of the natural world. In Book IV chapter VI of Principles of Political Economy Of the Stationary State Mill recognised wealth beyond the material and argued that the logical conclusion of unlimited growth was destruction of the environment and a reduced quality of life. He concluded that a stationary state could be preferable to unending economic growth I cannot therefore regard the stationary states of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested towards it by political economists of the old school. If the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger but not a better or a happier population I sincerely hope for the sake of posterity that they will be content to be stationary long before necessity compel them to it. According to Mill the ultimate tendency in an economy is for the rate of profit to decline due to diminishing returns in agriculture and increase in population at a Malthusian rate.
Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Elizabeth Barrett Browning was an English poet of the Victorian era popular in Britain and the United States during her lifetime and frequently anthologised after her death; her work received renewed attention following the feminist scholarship of the 1970s and 1980s and greater recognition of women writers in English. Born in County Durham the eldest of 12 children Elizabeth Barrett wrote poetry from the age of eleven. Her mothers collection of her poems forms one of the largest extant collections of juvenilia by any English writer. At 15 she became ill suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life. Later in life she also developed lung problems possibly tuberculosis. She took laudanum for the pain from an early age which is likely to have contributed to her frail health. In the 1840s Elizabeth was introduced to literary society through her distant cousin and patron John Kenyon. Her first adult collection of poems was published in 1838 and she wrote prolifically from 1841 to 1844 producing poetry translation and prose. She campaigned for the abolition of slavery and her work helped influence reform in child labour legislation. Her prolific output made her a rival to Tennyson as a candidate for poet laureate on the death of Wordsworth. Elizabeths volume Poems brought her great success attracting the admiration of the writer Robert Browning. Their correspondence courtship and marriage were carried out in secret for fear of her fathers disapproval. Following the wedding she was indeed disinherited by her father. In 1846 the couple moved to Italy where she lived for the rest of her life. Elizabeth died in Florence in 1861. A collection of her later poems were published by her husband shortly after her death. They had a son known as Pen . Pen devoted himself to painting until his eyesight began to fail later in life. He also built a large collection of manuscripts and memorabilia of his parents but because he died intestate it was sold by public auction to various bidders and then scattered upon his death. The Armstrong Browning Library has recovered some of his collection and it now houses the worlds largest collection of Browning memorabilia. Elizabeths work had a major influence on prominent writers of the day including the American poets Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson. She is remembered for such poems as How Do I Love Thee and Aurora Leigh . Some of Elizabeth Barretts family had lived in Jamaica since 1655. Their wealth derived mainly from slave labour from their plantations in the Caribbean. Edward Barrett was owner of 10000 acres in the estates of Cinnamon Hill Cornwall Cambridge and Oxford in northern Jamaica. Elizabeths maternal grandfather owned sugar plantations farmed by slaves they bought from Africa mills glassworks and ships that traded between Jamaica and Newcastle in the United Kingdom. The family wished to hand down their name stipulating that Barrett always should be held as a surname. In some cases inheritance was given on condition that the name was used by the beneficiary; the English gentry and squirearchy had long encouraged this sort of name changing. Given this strong tradition Elizabeth used Elizabeth Barrett Moulton Barrett on legal documents and before she was married she often signed herself Elizabeth Barrett Barrett or EBB . Elizabeths father chose to raise his family in England and his business enterprises remained in Jamaica. Elizabeths mother Mary Graham Clarke also owned plantations farmed by enslaved people in the British West Indies. Elizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett was born on 6 March 1806 in Coxhoe Hall between the villages of Coxhoe and Kelloe in County Durham England. Her parents were Edward Barrett Moulton-Barrett and Mary Graham Clarke. However it has been suggested that when she was christened on 9 March she was already three or four months old and that this was concealed because her parents had married only on 14 May 1805. Although she had already been baptised by a family friend in that first week of her life she was baptised again more publicly on 10 February 1808 at Kelloe parish church at the same time as her younger brother Edward . He had been born in June 1807 only 15 months after Elizabeths stated date of birth. A private christening might seem unlikely for a family of standing and while Bros birth was celebrated with a holiday on the familys Caribbean plantations Elizabeths was not. Elizabeth was the eldest of 12 children . Eleven lived to adulthood; one daughter died at the age of 3 when Elizabeth was 8. The children all had nicknames Elizabeth was Ba. She rode her pony went for family walks and picnics socialised with other county families and participated in home theatrical productions. Unlike her siblings she immersed herself in books as often as she could get away from the social rituals of her family. In 1809 the family moved to Hope End a 500-acre estate near the Malvern Hills in Ledbury Herefordshire. Her father converted the Georgian house into stables and built a mansion of opulent Turkish design which his wife described as something from the Arabian Nights Entertainments. The interiors brass balustrades mahogany doors inlaid with mother-of-pearl and finely carved fireplaces were eventually complemented by lavish landscaping ponds grottos kiosks an ice house a hothouse and a subterranean passage from house to gardens. Her time at Hope End inspired her in later life to write Aurora Leigh her most ambitious work which went through more than 20 editions by 1900 but none from 1905 to 1978. She was educated at home and tutored by Daniel McSwiney with her oldest brother. She began writing verses at the age of four. During the Hope End period she was an intensely studious precocious child. She claimed that she was reading novels at age 6 having been entranced by Popes translations of Homer at age 8 studying Greek at age 10 and writing her own Homeric epic The Battle of Marathon A Poem at age 11. In 1820 Mr Barrett privately published The Battle of Marathon an epic-style poem but all copies remained within the family. Her mother compiled the childs poetry into collections of Poems by Elizabeth B. Barrett. Her father called her the Poet Laureate of Hope End and encouraged her work. The result is one of the larger collections of juvenilia of any English writer. Mary Russell Mitford described the young Elizabeth at this time as having a slight delicate figure with a shower of dark curls falling on each side of a most expressive face; large tender eyes richly fringed by dark eyelashes and a smile like a sunbeam. At about this time Elizabeth began to battle an illness which the medical science of the time was unable to diagnose. All three sisters came down with the syndrome but it lasted only with Elizabeth. She had intense head and spinal pain with loss of mobility. Various biographies link this to a riding accident at the time but there is no evidence to support the link. Sent to recover at the Gloucester spa she was treated in the absence of symptoms supporting another diagnosis for a spinal problem. This illness continued for the rest of her life and it is believed to be unrelated to the lung disease which she developed in 1837. She began to take opiates for the pain laudanum followed by morphine then commonly prescribed. She became dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use from an early age may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this dependency have contributed to the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced. By 1821 she had read Mary Wollstonecrafts A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and she become a passionate supporter of Wollstonecrafts political ideas. The childs intellectual fascination with the classics and metaphysics was reflected in a religious intensity which she later described as not the deep persuasion of the mild Christian but the wild visions of an enthusiast. The Barretts attended services at the nearest Dissenting chapel and Edward was active in Bible and missionary societies. Elizabeths mother died in 1828 and she is buried at St Michaels Church Ledbury next to her daughter Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke Elizabeths aunt helped to care for the children and she had clashes with Elizabeths strong will. In 1831 Elizabeths grandmother Elizabeth Moulton died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor the place was seized and sold to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings he would not discuss his situation and the family was haunted by the idea that they might have to move to Jamaica. From 1833 to 1835 she was living with her family at Belle Vue in Sidmouth. The site has now been renamed Cedar Shade and redeveloped. A blue plaque at the entrance to the site attests to its previous existence. In 1838 some years after the sale of Hope End the family settled at 50 Wimpole Street. During 18371838 the poet was struck with illness again with symptoms today suggesting tuberculous ulceration of the lungs. The same year at her physicians insistence she moved from London to Torquay on the Devonshire coast. Her former home now forms part of the Regina Hotel. Two tragedies then struck. In February 1840 her brother Samuel died of a fever in Jamaica then her favourite brother Edward was drowned in a sailing accident in Torquay in July. These events had a serious effect on her already fragile health. She felt guilty as her father had disapproved of Edwards trip to Torquay. She wrote to Mitford That was a very near escape from madness absolute hopeless madness. The family returned to Wimpole Street in 1841. At Wimpole Street Elizabeth spent most of her time in her upstairs room. Her health began to improve but she saw few people other than her immediate family. One of those was John Kenyon a wealthy friend and distant cousin of the family and patron of the arts. She received comfort from a spaniel named Flush a gift from Mary Mitford. . From 1841 to 1844 Elizabeth was prolific in poetry translation and prose. The poem The Cry of the Children published in 1842 in Blackwoods condemned child labour and helped bring about child-labour reforms by raising support for Lord Shaftesburys Ten Hours Bill . About the same time she contributed critical prose pieces to Richard Henry Hornes A New Spirit of the Age including a laudatory essay on Thomas Carlyle. In 1844 she published the two-volume Poems which included A Drama of Exile A Vision of Poets and Lady Geraldines Courtship and two substantial critical essays for 1842 issues of The Athenaeum. A self-proclaimed adorer of Carlyle she sent a copy to him as a tribute of admiration respect which began a correspondence between them. Since she was not burdened with any domestic duties expected of her sisters Barrett Browning could now devote herself entirely to the life of the mind cultivating an enormous correspondence reading widely. Her prolific output made her a rival to Tennyson as a candidate for poet laureate in 1850 on the death of Wordsworth. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque now commemorates Elizabeth at 50 Wimpole Street. Her 1844 volume Poems made her one of the more popular writers in the country and inspired Robert Browning to write to her. He wrote I love your verses with all my heart dear Miss Barrett praising their fresh strange music the affluent language the exquisite pathos and true new brave thought. Kenyon arranged for Browning to meet Elizabeth on 20 May 1845 in her rooms and so began one of the most famous courtships in literature. Elizabeth had produced a large amount of work but Browning had a great influence on her subsequent writing as did she on his Two of Barretts most famous pieces were written after she met Browning Sonnets from the Portuguese and Aurora Leigh. Roberts Men and Women is also a product of that time. Some critics state that her activity was in some ways in decay before she met Browning Until her relationship with Robert Browning began in 1845 Barretts willingness to engage in public discourse about social issues and about aesthetic issues in poetry which had been so strong in her youth gradually diminished as did her physical health. As an intellectual presence and a physical being she was becoming a shadow of herself. The courtship and marriage between Robert Browning and Elizabeth were made secretly as she knew her father would disapprove. After a private marriage at St Marylebone Parish Church they honeymooned in Paris and then moved to Italy in September 1846 which became their home almost continuously until her death. Elizabeths loyal ladys maid Elizabeth Wilson witnessed the marriage and accompanied the couple to Italy. Mr Barrett disinherited Elizabeth as he did each of his children who married. Elizabeth had foreseen her fathers anger but had not anticipated her brothers rejection. As Elizabeth had some money of her own the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy. The Brownings were well respected and even famous. Elizabeth grew stronger and in 1849 at the age of 43 between four miscarriages she gave birth to a son Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning whom they called Pen. Their son later married but had no legitimate children. At her husbands insistence Elizabeths second edition of Poems included her love sonnets; as a result her popularity increased and her artistic position was confirmed. During the years of her marriage her literary reputation far surpassed that of her poet-husband; when visitors came to their home in Florence she was invariably the greater attraction. The couple came to know a wide circle of artists and writers including William Makepeace Thackeray sculptor Harriet Hosmer and Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1849 she met Margaret Fuller; Carlyle in 1851; French novelist George Sand in 1852 whom she had long admired. Among her intimate friends in Florence was the writer Isa Blagden whom she encouraged to write novels. They met Alfred Tennyson in Paris and John Forster Samuel Rogers and the Carlyles in London later befriending Charles Kingsley and John Ruskin. After the death of an old friend G. B. Hunter and then of her father Barrett Brownings health started to deteriorate. The Brownings moved from Florence to Siena residing at the Villa Alberti. Engrossed in Italian politics she issued a small volume of political poems titled Poems before Congress most of which were written to express her sympathy with the Italian cause after the outbreak of fighting in 1859. They caused a furore in Britain and the conservative magazines Blackwoods and the Saturday Review labelled her a fanatic. She dedicated this book to her husband. Her last work was A Musical Instrument published posthumously. Barrett Brownings sister Henrietta died in November 1860. The couple spent the winter of 18601861 in Rome where Barrett Brownings health deteriorated and they returned to Florence in early June 1861. She became gradually weaker using morphine to ease her pain. She died on 29 June 1861 in her husbands arms. Browning said that she died smilingly happily and with a face like a girls...Her last word was...Beautiful . She was buried in the Protestant English Cemetery of Florence. On Monday July 1 the shops in the area around Casa Guidi were closed while Elizabeth was mourned with unusual demonstrations. The nature of her illness is still unclear. Some modern scientists speculate her illness may have been hypokalemic periodic paralysis a genetic disorder that causes weakness and many of the other symptoms she described. Barrett Brownings first known poem On the Cruelty of Forcement to Man was written at the age of 6 or 8. The manuscript which protests against impressment is currently in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library; the exact date is controversial because the 2 in the date 1812 is written over something else that is scratched out. Her first independent publication was Stanzas Excited by Reflections on the Present State of Greece in The New Monthly Magazine of May 1821; followed two months later by Thoughts Awakened by Contemplating a Piece of the Palm which Grows on the Summit of the Acropolis at Athens. Her first collection of poems An Essay on Mind with Other Poems was published in 1826 and reflected her passion for Byron and Greek politics. Its publication drew the attention of Hugh Stuart Boyd a blind scholar of the Greek language and of Uvedale Price another Greek scholar with whom she maintained sustained correspondence. Among other neighbours was Mrs James Martin from Colwall with whom she corresponded throughout her life. Later at Boyds suggestion she translated Aeschylus Prometheus Bound . During their friendship Barrett studied Greek literature including Homer Pindar and Aristophanes. Elizabeth opposed slavery and published two poems highlighting the barbarity of the institution and her support for the abolitionist cause The Runaway Slave at Pilgrims Point and A Curse for a Nation. The first depicts an enslaved woman whipped raped and made pregnant cursing her enslavers. Elizabeth declared herself glad that the slaves were virtually free when the Slavery Abolition Act passed in the British Parliament despite the fact that her father believed that abolition would ruin his business. The date of publication of these poems is in dispute but her position on slavery in the poems is clear and may have led to a rift between Elizabeth and her father. She wrote to John Ruskin in 1855 I belong to a family of West Indian slaveholders and if I believed in curses I should be afraid. Her father and uncle were unaffected by the Baptist War and continued to own slaves until passage of the Slavery Abolition Act. In London John Kenyon introduced Elizabeth to literary figures including William Wordsworth Mary Russell Mitford Samuel Taylor Coleridge Alfred Tennyson and Thomas Carlyle. Elizabeth continued to write contributing The Romaunt of Margaret The Romaunt of the Page The Poets Vow and other pieces to various periodicals. She corresponded with other writers including Mary Russell Mitford who became a close friend and who supported Elizabeths literary ambitions. In 1838 The Seraphim and Other Poems appeared the first volume of Elizabeths mature poetry to appear under her own name. Sonnets from the Portuguese was published in 1850. There is debate about the origin of the title. Some say it refers to the series of sonnets of the 16th-century Portuguese poet Luís de Camões. However my little Portuguese was a pet name that Browning had adopted for Elizabeth and this may have some connection. The verse-novel Aurora Leigh her most ambitious and perhaps the most popular of her longer poems appeared in 1856. It is the story of a female writer making her way in life balancing work and love and based on Elizabeths own experiences. Aurora Leigh was an important influence on Susan B. Anthonys thinking about the traditional roles of women with regard to marriage versus independent individuality. The North American Review praised Elizabeths poem Mrs. Brownings poems are in all respects the utterance of a woman of a woman of great learning rich experience and powerful genius uniting to her womans nature the strength which is sometimes thought peculiar to a man. Much of Barrett Brownings work carries a religious theme. She had read and studied such works as Miltons Paradise Lost and Dantes Inferno. She says in her writing We want the sense of the saturation of Christs blood upon the souls of our poets that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless wail of the Sphinx of our humanity expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among the Greek Christian poets something which would have been much with a stronger faculty. She believed that Christs religion is essentially poetry poetry glorified. She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems especially in her early work such as the sonnets. She was interested in theological debate had learned Hebrew and read the Hebrew Bible. Her seminal Aurora Leigh for example features religious imagery and allusion to the apocalypse. The critic Cynthia Scheinberg notes that female characters in Aurora Leigh and her earlier work The Virgin Mary to the Child Jesus allude to Miriam sister and caregiver to Moses. These allusions to Miriam in both poems mirror the way in which Barrett Browning herself drew from Jewish history while distancing herself from it in order to maintain the cultural norms of a Christian woman poet of the Victorian Age. In the correspondence Barrett Browning kept with the Reverend William Merry from 1843 to 1844 on predestination and salvation by works she identifies herself as a Congregationalist I am not a Baptist but a Congregational Christian in the holding of my private opinions. In 1892 Ledbury Herefordshire held a design competition to build an Institute in honour of Barrett Browning. Brightwen Binyon beat 44 other designs. It was based on the timber-framed Market House which was opposite the site and was completed in 1896. However Nikolaus Pevsner was not impressed by its style. It was used as a public library from 1938 to 2021 when new library facilities were provided for the town and is now the headquarters of the Ledbury Poetry Festival. It has been Grade II-listed since 2007. How Do I Love TheeHow do I love thee Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach when feeling out of sightFor the ends of being and ideal grace.I love thee to the level of every daysMost quiet need by sun and candle-light.I love thee freely as men strive for right.I love thee purely as they turn from praise.I love thee with the passion put to useIn my old griefs and with my childhoods faith.I love thee with a love I seemed to loseWith my lost saints. I love thee with the breathSmiles tears of all my life; and if God chooseI shall but love thee better after death. Sonnet XLIII from Sonnets from the Portuguese 1845  Barrett Browning was widely popular in the United Kingdom and the United States during her lifetime.Edgar Allan Poe was inspired by her poem Lady Geraldines Courtship and specifically borrowed the poems metre for his poem The Raven. Poe had reviewed Barrett Brownings work in the January 1845 issue of the Broadway Journal writing that her poetic inspiration is the highest we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself. In return she praised The Raven and Poe dedicated his 1845 collection The Raven and Other Poems to her referring to her as the noblest of her sex. Barrett Brownings poetry greatly influenced Emily Dickinson who admired her as a woman of achievement. Her popularity in the United States and Britain was advanced by her stands against social injustice including slavery in the United States injustice toward Italians from their foreign rulers and child labour. Lilian Whiting published a biography of Barrett Browning which describes her as the most philosophical poet and depicts her life as a Gospel of applied Christianity. To Whiting the term art for arts sake did not apply to Barrett Brownings work as each poem distinctively purposeful was borne of a more honest vision. In this critical analysis Whiting portrays Barrett Browning as a poet who uses knowledge of Classical literature with an intuitive gift of spiritual divination. In Elizabeth Barrett Browning Angela Leighton suggests that the portrayal of Barrett Browning as the pious iconography of womanhood has distracted us from her poetic achievements. Leighton cites the 1931 play by Rudolf Besier The Barretts of Wimpole Street as evidence that 20th-century literary criticism of Barrett Brownings work has suffered more as a result of her popularity than poetic ineptitude. The play was popularized by actress Katharine Cornell for whom it became a signature role. It was an enormous success both artistically and commercially and was revived several times and adapted twice into movies. Sampson however considers the play to have been the most damaging cause of false myths about Elizabeth and particularly the relationship with her allegedly tyrannical father. Throughout the 20th century literary criticism of Barrett Brownings poetry remained sparse until her poems were discovered by the womens movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several womens rights principles suggesting in letters to Mary Russell Mitford and her husband that she believed that there was an inferiority of intellect in women. In Aurora Leigh however she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority she is defined only in mysterious opposition to everything that distinguishes the male subject who writes... A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010 the first in over a century.
"Alfred, Lord Tennyson",Alfred Tennyson 1st Baron Tennyson FRS was an English poet. He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victorias reign. In 1829 Tennyson was awarded the Chancellors Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces Timbuktu. He published his first solo collection of poems Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. Claribel and Mariana which remain some of Tennysons most celebrated poems were included in this volume. Although described by some critics as overly sentimental his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennysons early poetry with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Tennyson also excelled at short lyrics such as Break Break Break The Charge of the Light Brigade Tears Idle Tears and Crossing the Bar. Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes such as Ulysses. In Memoriam A.H.H. was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam a fellow poet and student at Trinity College Cambridge after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King Ulysses and Tithonus. During his career Tennyson attempted drama but his plays enjoyed little success. A number of phrases from Tennysons work have become commonplace in the English language including Nature red in tooth and claw Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to do and die My strength is as the strength of ten Because my heart is pure To strive to seek to find and not to yield Knowledge comes but Wisdom lingers and The old order changeth yielding place to new. He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. Tennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers Charles Tennyson Turner later married Louisa Sellwood the younger sister of Alfreds future wife; the other was Frederick Tennyson. Another of Tennysons brothers Edward Tennyson was institutionalised at a private asylum. Tennyson was a student of King EdwardVI Grammar School Louth from 1816 to 1820. He entered Trinity College Cambridge in 1827 where he joined a secret society called the Cambridge Apostles. A portrait of Tennyson by George Frederic Watts is in Trinitys collection. At Cambridge Tennyson met Arthur Hallam and William Henry Brookfield who became his closest friends. His first publication was a collection of his boyish rhymes and those of his elder brother Charles entitled Poems by Two Brothers published in 1827. In 1829 Tennyson was awarded the Chancellors Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces Timbuktu. Reportedly it was thought to be no slight honour for a young man of twenty to win the chancellors gold medal. He published his first solo collection of poems Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. Claribel and Mariana which later took their place among Tennysons most celebrated poems were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In the spring of 1831 Tennysons father died requiring him to leave Cambridge before taking his degree. He returned to the rectory where he was permitted to live for another six years and shared responsibility for his widowed mother and the family. Arthur Hallam came to stay with his family during the summer and became engaged to Tennysons sister Emilia Tennyson. The May QueenYOU must wake and call me early call me early mother dear;To-morrow ll be the happiest time of all the glad new-year -Of all the glad new-year mother the maddest merriest day;For Im to be Queen o the May mother Im to be Queen o the May.As I came up the valley whom think ye should I seeBut Robin leaning on the bridge beneath the hazel-treeHe thought of that sharp look mother I gave him yesterday -But Im to be Queen o the May mother Im to be Queen o the May.They say hes dying all for love - but that can never be;They say his heart is breaking mother - what is that to meTheres many a bolder lad ll woo me any sum-mer day;And Im to be Queen o the May mother Im to be Queen o the May.If I can Ill come again mother from out my resting-place;Though youll not see me mother I shall look upon your face;Though I cannot speak a word I shall hearken what you sayAnd be often often with you when you think Im far away. So now I think my time is near; I trust it is. I knowThe blessed music went that way my soul will have to go.And for myself indeed I care not if I go to-day;But Effie you must comfort her when I am past away.And say to Robin a kind word and tell him not to fret;Theres many worthier than I would make him happy yet.If I had lived - I cannot tell - I might have been his wife;But all these things have ceased to be with my desire of life.Forever and forever all in a blessed homeAnd there to wait a little while till you and Effie come -To lie within the light of God as I lie upon your breast -And the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. In 1833 Tennyson published his second book of poetry which notably included the first version of The Lady of Shalott. The volume met heavy criticism which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years although he did continue to write. That same year Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage while on a holiday in Vienna. Hallams death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems including In the Valley of Cauteretz and In Memoriam A.H.H. a long poem detailing the Way of the Soul. Tennyson and his family were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time but later moved to Beech Hill Park High Beach deep within Epping Forest Essex about 1837. Tennysons son recalled there was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. He liked the nearness of London whither he resorted to see his friends but he could not stay in town even for a night his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her.... Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet John Clare. An unwise investment in Dr Allens ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune and led to a bout of serious depression. According to Tennysons grandson Sir Charles Tennyson Tennyson met Thomas Carlyle in 1839 if not earlier. The pair began a lifelong friendship and were famous smoking companions. Some of Tennysons work even bears the influence of Carlyle and his ideas. Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at Chapel House Twickenham. On 14 May 1842 while living modestly in London Tennyson published the two volume Poems of which the first included works already published and the second was made up almost entirely of new poems. They met with immediate success; poems from this collection such as Locksley Hall Break Break Break and Ulysses and a new version of The Lady of Shalott have met enduring fame. The Princess A Medley a satire on womens education that came out in 1847 was also popular for its lyrics. W. S. Gilbert later adapted and parodied the piece twice in The Princess and in Princess Ida . It was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career finally publishing his masterpiece In Memoriam A.H.H. dedicated to Hallam. Later the same year he was appointed Poet Laureate succeeding William Wordsworth. In the same year Tennyson married Emily Sellwood whom he had known since childhood in the village of Shiplake. They had two sons Hallam Tennyson named after his friendand Lionel . Tennyson rented Farringford House on the Isle of Wight in 1853 eventually buying it in 1856. He eventually found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford so he moved to Aldworth in West Sussex in 1869. However he retained Farringford and regularly returned there to spend the winters. Break Break Break on thy cold grey Stones o Sea a photograph by Rudolf Eickemeyer Jr. The title is a quote from the 1842 poem. Tennyson with his wife Emily and his sons Hallam and Lionel  Farringford Lord Tennysons residence on the Isle of Wight Alfred Tennyson 1st Baron Tennyson by George Frederic Watts  In 1850 after William Wordsworths death and Samuel Rogers refusal Tennyson was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate; Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Leigh Hunt had also been considered. He held the position until his own death in 1892 the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position such as by authoring a poem of greeting to Princess Alexandra of Denmark when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King Edward VII. In 1855 Tennyson produced one of his best-known works The Charge of the Light Brigade a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in an ill-advised charge on 25 October 1854 during the Crimean War. Other esteemed works written in the post of Poet Laureate include Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington and Ode Sung at the Opening of the International Exhibition. Tennyson declined a baronetcy offered him by Disraeli in 1865 and 1868 finally accepting a peerage in 1883 at Gladstones earnest solicitation. In 1884 Victoria created him Baron Tennyson of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of Freshwater in the Isle of Wight. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 March 1884. Tennyson also wrote a substantial quantity of unofficial political verse from the bellicose Form Riflemen Form on the French crisis of 1859 and the Creation of the Volunteer Force to Steersman be not precipitate in thine actof steering deploring Gladstones Home Rule Bill. Tennysons family were Whigs by tradition and Tennysons own politics fitted the Whig mould although he would also vote for the Liberal Party after the Whigs dissolved. Tennyson believed that society should progress through gradual and steady reform not revolution and this attitude was reflected in his attitude toward universal suffrage which he did not outright reject but recommended only after the masses had been properly educated and adjusted to self-government. Upon passage of the 1832 Reform Act Tennyson broke into a local church to ring the bells in celebration. Virginia Woolf wrote a play called Freshwater showing Tennyson as host to his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and G. F. Watts. Colonel George Edward Gouraud Thomas Edisons European agent made sound recordings of Tennyson reading his own poetry late in his life. They include recordings of The Charge of the Light Brigade and excerpts from The splendour falls Come into the garden Ask me no more Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington and Lancelot and Elaine. The sound quality is poor as wax cylinder recordings usually are. Towards the end of his life Tennyson declared himself agnostic and pan-deist and at one with the great heretics Giordano Bruno and Baruch Spinoza. In a characteristically Victorian manner Tennyson combines a deep interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox even idiosyncratic Christian belief. Famously he wrote in In Memoriam There lives more faith in honest doubt believe me than in half the creeds. In Maud 1855 he wrote The churches have killed their Christ. In Locksley Hall Sixty Years After Tennyson wrote Christian love among the churches lookd the twin of heathen hate. In his play Becket he wrote We are self-uncertain creatures and we may Yea even when we know not mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven. Tennyson recorded in his Diary I believe in Pantheism of a sort. His sons biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian noting that Tennyson praised Giordano Bruno and Spinoza on his deathbed saying of Bruno His view of God is in some ways mine in 1892. Tennyson continued writing into his eighties. He died on 6 October 1892 at Aldworth aged 83. He was buried at Westminster Abbey. A memorial was erected in All Saints Church Freshwater. His last words were Oh that press will have me now. He left an estate of 57206.Tennyson Down and the Tennyson Trail on the Isle of Wight are named after him and a monument to him stands on top of Tennyson Down. Lake Tennyson in New Zealands high country named by Frederick Weld is assumed to be named after Lord Tennyson. He was succeeded as 2nd Baron Tennyson by his son Hallam who produced an authorised biography of his father in 1897 and was later the second Governor-General of Australia. Although Albert Prince Consort was largely responsible for Tennysons appointment as LaureateQueen Victoria became an ardent admirer of Tennysons work writing in her diary that she was much soothed pleased by reading In Memoriam A.H.H. after Alberts death. The two met twice first in April 1862 when Victoria wrote in her diary very peculiar looking tall dark with a fine head long black flowing hair a beard oddly dressed but there is no affectation about him. Tennyson met her a second time just over two decades later on 7 August 1883 and the Queen told him what a comfort In Memoriam A.H.H. had been. As source material for his poetry Tennyson used a wide range of subject matter ranging from medieval legends to classical myths and from domestic situations to observations of nature. The influence of John Keats and other Romantic poets published before and during his childhood is evident from the richness of his imagery and descriptive writing. He also handled rhythm masterfully. The insistent beat of Break Break Break emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennysons use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of I come from haunts of coot and hern lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of Come down O maid from yonder mountain height illustrate his telling combination of onomatopoeia alliteration and assonance The moan of doves in immemorial elmsAnd murmuring of innumerable bees. Tennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively to the point where his efforts at self-editing were described by his contemporary Robert Browning as insane symptomatic of mental infirmity. His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and words as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in. Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of metre; like many Victorian poets he experimented in adapting the quantitative metres of Greek and Latin poetry to English. He reflects the Victorian period of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising. He also reflects a concern common among Victorian writers in being troubled by the conflict between religious faith and expanding scientific knowledge. Tennyson possessed a strong poetic power which his early readers often attributed to his Englishness and his masculinity. Well-known among his longer works are Maud and Idylls of the King the latter arguably the most famous Victorian adaptation of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. A common thread of grief melancholy and loss connects much of his poetry possibly reflecting Tennysons own lifelong struggle with debilitating depression. T.S. Eliot famously described Tennyson as the saddest of all English poets whose technical mastery of verse and language provided a surface to his poetrys depths to the abyss of sorrow. Other poets such as W. H. Auden maintained a more critical stance stating that Tennyson was the stupidest of all the English poets adding that There was little about melancholia he didnt know; there was little else that he did. Tennysons early poetry with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 1848 Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of Immortals artistic heroes whom they admired especially from literature notably including Keats and Tennyson whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings.The Lady of Shalott alone was a subject for Rossetti Hunt John William Waterhouse and Elizabeth Siddall. A heraldic achievement of Alfred Lord Tennyson exists in an 1884 stained-glass window in the Hall of Trinity College Cambridge showing arms  Gules a bend nebuly or thereon a chaplet vert between three leopards faces jessant-de-lys of the second; Crest A dexter arm in armour the hand in a gauntlet or grasping a broken tilting spear enfiled with a garland of laurel; Supporters Two leopards rampant guardant gules semée de lys and ducally crowned or; Motto Respiciens Prospiciens looking forwards. These are a difference of the arms of Thomas Tenison Archbishop of Canterbury themselves a difference of the arms of the 13th-century Denys family of Glamorgan and Siston in Gloucestershire themselves a difference of the arms of Thomas de Cantilupe Bishop of Hereford henceforth the arms of the See of Hereford; the name Tennyson signifies Denyss son although no connection between the two families is recorded.
Charles Dickens,Charles John Huffam Dickens was an English novelist and social critic who created some of the worlds best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and by the 20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today. Born in Portsmouth Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his father John was incarcerated in a debtors prison. After three years he returned to school before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years wrote 15 novels five novellas hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles lectured and performed readings extensively was an indefatigable letter writer and campaigned vigorously for childrens rights for education and for other social reforms. Dickenss literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers a publishing phenomenonthanks largely to the introduction of the character Sam Weller in the fourth episodethat sparked Pickwick merchandise and spin-offs. Within a few years Dickens had become an international literary celebrity famous for his humour satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels most of them published in monthly or weekly installments pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense. The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audiences reaction and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example when his wifes chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her own disabilities Dickens improved the character with positive features. His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a halfpenny to have each new monthly episode read to them opening up and inspiring a new class of readers. His 1843 novella A Christmas Carol remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted and like many of his novels evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era he undertook in response to public demand a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings such as poor social or working conditions or comically repulsive characters. Charles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace Landport in Portsea Island Hampshire the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens and John Dickens . His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam rigger to His Majestys Navy gentleman and head of an established firm to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey the owner of a shipping company in Dickenss novel Dombey and Son . In January 1815 John Dickens was called back to London and the family moved to Norfolk Street Fitzrovia. When Charles was four they relocated to Sheerness and thence to Chatham Kent where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic though he thought himself a very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy. Charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding as well as Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas. He read and re-read The Arabian Nights and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald. At the age of 7 he first saw Joseph Grimaldithe father of modern clowningperform at the Star Theatre Rochester. He later imitated Grimaldis clowning on several occasions and would also edit the Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi. He retained poignant memories of childhood helped by an excellent memory of people and events which he used in his writing. His fathers brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education first at a dame school and then at a school run by William Giles a dissenter in Chatham. This period came to an end in June 1822 when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House and the family moved to Camden Town in London. The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and living beyond his means John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors prison in Southwark London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there as was the practice at the time. Charles then 12 years old boarded with Elizabeth Roylance a family friend at 112 College Place Camden Town. Mrs Roylance was a reduced impoverished old lady long known to our family whom Dickens later immortalised with a few alterations and embellishments as Mrs Pipchin in Dombey and Son. Later he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the Insolvent Court Archibald Russell a fat good-natured kind old gentleman ... with a quiet old wife and lame son in Lant Street in Southwark. They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in The Old Curiosity Shop. On Sundays with his sister Frances free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music he spent the day at the Marshalsea. Dickens later used the prison as a setting in Little Dorrit. To pay for his board and to help his family Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warrens Blacking Warehouse on Hungerford Stairs near the present Charing Cross railway station where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age. As he recalled to John Forster  The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy tumble-down old house abutting of course on the river and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times and the dirt and decay of the place rise up visibly before me as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat all round until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecarys shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection I was to paste on each a printed label and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up in a ragged apron and a paper cap on the first Monday morning to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name long afterwards in Oliver Twist. When the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart busy district of Covent Garden the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street. Small audiences gathered and watched them at work in Dickenss biographer Simon Callows estimation the public display was a new refinement added to his misery. A few months after his imprisonment John Dickenss mother Elizabeth Dickens died and bequeathed him 450. On the expectation of this legacy Dickens was released from prison. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors and he and his family left the Marshalsea for the home of Mrs Roylance. Charless mother Elizabeth Dickens did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickenss view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home I never afterwards forgot I never shall forget I never can forget that my mother was warm for my being sent back. His mothers failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women. Righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite and most autobiographical novel David Copperfield I had no advice no counsel no encouragement no consolation no assistance no support of any kind from anyone that I can call to mind as I hope to go to heaven Dickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in Camden Town where he remained until March 1827 having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school Much of the haphazard desultory teaching poor discipline punctuated by the headmasters sadistic brutality the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere are embodied in Mr Creakles Establishment in David Copperfield. Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore attorneys of Holborn Court Grays Inn as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him clients lawyers and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his monopolylogues by heart. Then having learned Gurneys system of shorthand in his spare time he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative Thomas Charlton was a freelance reporter at Doctors Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years. This education was to inform works such as Nicholas Nickleby Dombey and Son and especially Bleak House whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickenss own views regarding particularly the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to go to law. In 1830 Dickens met his first love Maria Beadnell thought to have been the model for the character Dora in David Copperfield. Marias parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris. In 1832 at the age of 20 Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident. He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment lacked a clear specific sense of what he wanted to become and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre he became an early member of the Garrick Club he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose he had set out on his career as a writer. In 1833 Dickens submitted his first story A Dinner at Poplar Walk to the London periodical Monthly Magazine. William Barrow Dickenss uncle on his mothers side offered him a job on The Mirror of Parliament and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at Furnivals Inn and worked as a political journalist reporting on Parliamentary debates and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the Morning Chronicle. His journalism in the form of sketches in periodicals formed his first collection of pieces published in 1836 Sketches by Boz Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years. Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname Moses which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens after a character in Oliver Goldsmiths The Vicar of Wakefield. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold Moses became Boses later shortened to Boz. Dickenss own name was considered queer by a contemporary critic who wrote in 1849 Mr Dickens as if in revenge for his own queer name does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations. Dickens contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career. In January 1835 the Morning Chronicle launched an evening edition under the editorship of the Chronicles music critic George Hogarth. Hogarth invited him to contribute Street Sketches and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house excited by Hogarths friendship with Walter Scott and enjoying the company of Hogarths three daughters Georgina Mary and 19-year-old Catherine. Dickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with William Harrison Ainsworth the author of the highwayman novel Rookwood whose bachelor salon in Harrow Road had become the meeting place for a set that included Daniel Maclise Benjamin Disraeli Edward Bulwer-Lytton and George Cruikshank. All these became his friends and collaborators with the exception of Disraeli and he met his first publisher John Macrone at the house. The success of Sketches by Boz led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymours engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and Dickens who wanted to write a connected series of sketches hired Phiz to provide the engravings for the story. The resulting story became The Pickwick Papers and although the first few episodes were not successful the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode marked a sharp climb in its popularity. The final instalment sold 40000 copies. On the impact of the character The Paris Review stated arguably the most historic bump in English publishing is the Sam Weller Bump. A publishing phenomenon John Sutherland called The Pickwick Papers he most important single novel of the Victorian era. The unprecedented success led to numerous spin-offs and merchandise including Pickwick cigars playing cards china figurines Sam Weller puzzles Weller boot polish and joke books. The Sam Weller Bump testifies not merely to Dickenss comic genius but to his acumen as an authorpreneur a portmanteau he inhabited long before The Economist took it up. For a writer who made his reputation crusading against the squalor of the Industrial Revolution Dickens was a creature of capitalism; he used everything from the powerful new printing presses to the enhanced advertising revenues to the expansion of railroads to sell more books. Dickens ensured that his books were available in cheap bindings for the lower orders as well as in morocco-and-gilt for people of quality; his ideal readership included everyone from the pickpockets who read Oliver Twist to Queen Victoria who found it exceedingly interesting. On the creation of modern mass culture Nicholas Dames in The Atlantic writes Literature is not a big enough category for Pickwick. It defined its own a new one that we have learned to call entertainment. In November 1836 Dickens accepted the position of editor of Bentleys Miscellany a position he held for three years until he fell out with the owner. In 1836 as he finished the last instalments of The Pickwick Papers he began writing the beginning instalments of Oliver Twist writing as many as 90 pages a month while continuing work on Bentleys and also writing four plays the production of which he oversaw. Oliver Twist published in 1838 became one of Dickenss better known stories and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist. On 2 April 1836 after a one-year engagement and between episodes two and three of The Pickwick Papers Dickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth the daughter of George Hogarth editor of the Evening Chronicle. They were married in St Lukes ChurchChelsea London. After a brief honeymoon in Chalk in Kent the couple returned to lodgings at Furnivals Inn. The first of their ten children Charles was born in January 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street London from 25 March 1837 until December 1839. Dickenss younger brother Frederick and Catherines 17-year-old sister Mary Hogarth moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. Unusually for Dickens as a consequence of his shock he stopped working and he and Catherine stayed at a little farm on Hampstead Heath for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary; the character he fashioned after her Rose Maylie he found he could not now kill as he had planned in his fiction and according to Ackroyd he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of Little Nell and Florence Dombey. His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of The Pickwick Papers and had to cancel the Oliver Twist instalment that month as well. The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop; Forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work. His success as a novelist continued. The young Queen Victoria read both Oliver Twist and The Pickwick Papers staying up until midnight to discuss them.Nicholas Nickleby The Old Curiosity Shop and finally his first historical novel Barnaby Rudge A Tale of the Riots of Eighty as part of the Master Humphreys Clock series were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books. In the midst of all his activity during this period there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off while Richard Bentley signed over all his rights in Oliver Twist. Other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerged; in Broadstairs he flirted with Eleanor Picken the young fiancée of his solicitors best friend and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the sad sea waves. She finally got free and afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841 he precipitously set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then in September 1841 telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America.Master Humphreys Clock was shut down though Dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine a form he liked an appreciation that had begun with his childhood reading of the 18th-century magazines Tatler and The Spectator. Dickens was perturbed by the return to power of the Tories whom he described as people whom politically I despise and abhor. He had been tempted to stand for the Liberals in Reading but decided against it due to financial straits. He wrote three anti-Tory verse satires which were published in The Examiner. On 22 January 1842 Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston Massachusetts aboard the RMS Britannia during their first trip to the United States and Canada. At this time Georgina Hogarth another sister of Catherine joined the Dickens household now living at Devonshire Terrace Marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind. She remained with them as housekeeper organiser adviser and friend until Dickenss death in 1870. Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary. He described his impressions in a travelogue American Notes for General Circulation. In Notes Dickens includes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as The Pickwick Papers correlating the emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery abroad citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickenss views on racial inequality. For instance he has been criticised for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor Eyres harsh crackdown during the 1860s Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it. From Richmond Virginia Dickens returned to Washington D.C. and started a trek westward with brief pauses in Cincinnati and Louisville to St. Louis Missouri. While there he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before returning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking Glass Prairie a trip 30 miles into Illinois. During his American visit Dickens spent a month in New York City giving lectures raising the question of international copyright laws and the pirating of his work in America. He persuaded a group of 25 writers headed by Washington Irving to sign a petition for him to take to Congress but the press were generally hostile to this saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated. The popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint who writes that he found himself a cultural commodity and its circulation had passed out his control causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels. She writes that he assumed a role of influential commentator publicly and in his fiction evident in his next few books. His trip to the U.S. ended with a trip to Canada Niagara Falls Toronto Kingston and Montreal where he appeared on stage in light comedies. Soon after his return to England Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories A Christmas Carol written in 1843 which was followed by The Chimes in 1844 and The Cricket on the Hearth in 1845. Of these A Christmas Carol was most popular and tapping into an old tradition did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America. The seeds for the story became planted in Dickenss mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School caused Dickens to resolve to strike a sledge hammer blow for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he wept and laughed and wept again as he walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed. After living briefly in Italy Dickens travelled to Switzerland where he began work on Dombey and Son . This and David Copperfield mark a significant artistic break in Dickenss career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works. At about this time he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother Augustus worked . It had been carried out by Thomas Powell a clerk who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities Powell fled to New York and published a book called The Living Authors of England with a chapter on Charles Dickens who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey on Thomas Chapman one of the principal partners at John Chapman Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to Lewis Gaylord Clark editor of the New York literary magazine The Knickerbocker saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the New-York Tribune and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications and Clark was arrested. Dickens realising that he had acted in haste contacted John Chapman Co to seek written confirmation of Powells guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powells embezzlement but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court. Angela Burdett Coutts heir to the Coutts banking fortune approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting Dickens eventually founded the home named Urania Cottage in the Lime Grove area of Shepherds Bush which he managed for ten years setting the house rules reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents. Emigration and marriage were central to Dickenss agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859. As a young man Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836 in a pamphlet titled Sunday Under Three Heads he defended the peoples right to pleasure opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. Look into your churches diminished congregations and scanty attendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this once in every seven. They display their feeling by staying away and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around. Dickens honoured the figure of Jesus Christ. He is regarded as a professing Christian. His son Henry Fielding Dickens described him as someone who possessed deep religious convictions. In the early 1840s he had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity and Robert Browning remarked that Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian. Professor Gary Colledge has written that he never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism. Dickens authored a work called The Life of Our Lord a book about the life of Christ written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family. In a scene from David Copperfield Dickens echoed Geoffrey Chaucers use of Luke 2334 from Troilus and Criseyde with G. K. Chesterton writing among the great canonical English authors Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common. Dickens disapproved of Roman Catholicism and 19th-century evangelicalism seeing both as extremes of Christianity and likely to limit personal expression and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like spiritualism all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of Christianity as shown in the book he wrote for his family in 1846. While Dickens advocated equal rights for Catholics in England he strongly disliked how individual civil liberties were often threatened in countries where Catholicism predominated and referred to the Catholic Church as that curse upon the world. Dickens also rejected the Evangelical conviction that the Bible was the infallible word of God. His ideas on Biblical interpretation were similar to the Liberal Anglican Arthur Penrhyn Stanleys doctrine of progressive revelation.Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky referred to Dickens as that great Christian writer. In December 1845 Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based Daily News a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate in his own words the Principles of Progress and Improvement of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation. Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and the social reformer Douglas William Jerrold who frequently attacked the Corn Laws. Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the papers co-owners. A Francophile Dickens often holidayed in France and in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French called the French the first people in the universe. During his visit to Paris Dickens met the French literati Alexandre Dumas Victor Hugo Eugène Scribe Théophile Gautier François-René de Chateaubriand and Eugène Sue. In early 1849 Dickens started to write David Copperfield. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickenss biography Life of Charles Dickens John Forster wrote of David Copperfield underneath the fiction lay something of the authors life. It was Dickenss personal favourite among his own novels as he wrote in the authors preface to the 1867 edition of the novel. In late November 1851 Dickens moved into Tavistock House where he wrote Bleak House Hard Times and Little Dorrit . It was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forsters Life of Charles Dickens. During this period he worked closely with the novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins. In 1856 his income from writing allowed him to buy Gads Hill Place in Higham Kent. As a child Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of Shakespeares Henry IV Part 1 and this literary connection pleased him. During this time Dickens was also the publisher editor and a major contributor to the journals Household Words and All the Year Round . In 1854 at the behest of Sir John Franklins widow Lady Jane Dickens viciously attacked Arctic explorer John Rae in Household Words for his report to the Admiralty based on interviews with local Inuit that the members of Franklins lost expedition had resorted to cannibalism. These attacks would later be expanded on his 1856 play The Frozen Deep which satirizes Rae and the Inuit. 20th century archaeology work in King William Island later confirmed that the members of the Franklin expedition resorted to cannibalism. In 1855 when Dickenss good friend and Liberal MP Austen Henry Layard formed an Administrative Reform Association to demand significant reforms of Parliament Dickens joined and volunteered his resources in support of Layards cause. With the exception of Lord John Russell who was the only leading politician in whom Dickens had any faith and to whom he later dedicated A Tale of Two Cities Dickens believed that the political aristocracy and their incompetence were the death of England. When he and Layard were accused of fomenting class conflict Dickens replied that the classes were already in opposition and the fault was with the aristocratic class. Dickens used his pulpit in Household Words to champion the Reform Association. He also commented on foreign affairs declaring his support for Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini helping raise funds for their campaigns and stating that a united Italy would be of vast importance to the peace of the world and would be a rock in Louis Napoleons way and that I feel for Italy almost as if I were an Italian born. Dickens also published dozens of writings in Household Words supporting vaccination including multiple laudations for vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner. Following the Indian Mutiny of 1857 Dickens joined in the widespread criticism of the East India Company for its role in the event but reserved his fury for Indians wishing that he was the commander-in-chief in India so that he would be able to do my utmost to exterminate the Race upon whom the stain of the late cruelties rested. In 1857 Dickens hired professional actresses for The Frozen Deep written by him and his protégé Wilkie Collins. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses Ellen Ternan and this passion was to last the rest of his life. In 1858 when Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18 divorce was nearly unthinkable for someone as famous as he was. After publicly accusing Catherine of not loving their children and suffering from a mental disorder statements that disgusted his contemporaries including Elizabeth Barrett Browning Dickens attempted to have Catherine institutionalized. When this scheme failed they separated. When Catherine left never to see her husband again she took with her one child leaving the other children to be raised by her sister Georgina who chose to stay at Gads Hill. During this period whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His Drooping Buds essay in Household Words earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospitals founders to have been the catalyst for the hospitals success. Dickens whose philanthropy was well-known was asked by his friend the hospitals founder Charles West to preside over the appeal and he threw himself into the task heart and soul. Dickenss public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing; one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised 3000. After separating from Catherine Dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which together with his journalism were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade in which he was to write only two more novels. His first reading tour lasting from April 1858 to February 1859 consisted of 129 appearances in 49 towns throughout England Scotland and Ireland. Dickenss continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in Nicholas Nickleby but more importantly he found an outlet in public readings. In 1866 he undertook a series of public readings in England and Scotland with more the following year in England and Ireland. Other works soon followed including A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations which were resounding successes. Set in London and Paris A Tale of Two Cities is his best-known work of historical fiction and includes the famous opening sentence which begins with It was the best of times it was the worst of times. It is regularly cited as one of the best-selling novels of all time. Themes in Great Expectations include wealth and poverty love and rejection and the eventual triumph of good over evil. In early September 1860 in a field behind Gads Hill Dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence; only those letters on business matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative. In the 1930s Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers. That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickenss daughter Kate Perugini whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Storey published her account in Dickens and Daughter but no contemporary evidence exists. On his death Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her financially independent. Claire Tomalins book The Invisible Woman argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was subsequently turned into a play Little Nell by Simon Gray and a 2013 film. During the same period Dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal becoming one of the early members of The Ghost Club. In June 1862 he was offered 10000 for a reading tour of Australia. He was enthusiastic and even planned a travel book The Uncommercial Traveller Upside Down but ultimately decided against the tour. Two of his sons Alfred DOrsay Tennyson Dickens and Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens migrated to Australia Edward becoming a member of the Parliament of New South Wales as Member for Wilcannia between 1889 and 1894. On 9 June 1865 while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent. The trains first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water and saved some lives. Before leaving he remembered the unfinished manuscript for Our Mutual Friend and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it. Dickens later used the experience of the crash as material for his short ghost story The Signal-Man in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous rail accidents such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash in Sussex of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother which would have caused a scandal. After the crash Dickens was nervous when travelling by train and would use alternative means when available. In 1868 he wrote I have sudden vague rushes of terror even when riding in a hansom cab which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable. Dickenss son Henry recalled I have seen him sometimes in a railway carriage when there was a slight jolt. When this happened he was almost in a state of panic and gripped the seat with both hands. While he contemplated a second visit to the United States the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867 over two years after the war Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing in Boston he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher James T. Fields. In early December the readings began. He performed 76 readings netting 19000 from December 1867 to April 1868. Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the true American catarrh he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park. In 186869 Dickens gave a series of farewell readings in England Scotland and Ireland beginning on 6 October. He managed of a contracted 100 readings to give 75 in the provinces with a further 12 in London. As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He had a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester. He collapsed on 22 April 1869 at Preston Lancashire; on doctors advice the tour was cancelled. After further provincial readings were cancelled he began work on his final novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood. It was fashionable in the 1860s to do the slums and in company Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell where he witnessed an elderly addict called Laskar Sal who formed the model for Opium Sal in Edwin Drood. After Dickens regained enough strength he arranged with medical approval for a final series of readings to partly make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were 12 performances on 11 January to 15 March 1870; the last at 800pm at St. Jamess Hall London. Though in grave health by then he read A Christmas Carol and The Trial from Pickwick. On 2 May he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales paying a special tribute on the death of his friend illustrator Daniel Maclise. On 8 June 1870 Dickens had another stroke at his home after a full days work on Edwin Drood. He never regained consciousness and the next day he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he had had the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship. Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral in an inexpensive unostentatious and strictly private manner he was laid to rest in the Poets Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads To the Memory of Charles Dickens who died at his residence Higham near Rochester Kent 9June 1870 aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor the suffering and the oppressed; and by his death one of Englands greatest writers is lost to the world. A letter from Dickens to the Clerk of the Privy Council in March indicates hed been offered and had accepted a baronetcy which was not gazetted before his death. His last words were On the ground in response to his sister-in-law Georginas request that he lie down. On Sunday 19 June 1870 five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley delivered a memorial elegy lauding the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn for showing by his own example that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters genius could still be clean and mirth could be innocent. Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelists grave Stanley assured those present that the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old as that of the representative of literature not of this island only but of all who speak our English tongue. In his will drafted more than a year before his death Dickens left the care of his 80000 estate to his long-time colleague John Forster and his best and truest friend Georgina Hogarth who along with Dickenss two sons also received a tax-free sum of 8000 . Although Dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death he provided her with an annual income of 600 and made her similar allowances in his will. He also bequeathed 19 19s to each servant in his employment at the time of his death. Dickenss approach to the novel is influenced by various things including the picaresque novel traditionmelodrama and the novel of sensibility. According to Ackroyd other than these perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of The Arabian Nights. Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel. Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett. Fieldings Tom Jones was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens who read it in his youth and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him. Influenced by Gothic fictiona literary genre that began with The Castle of Otranto by Horace WalpoleDickens incorporated Gothic imagery settings and plot devices in his works. Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments in particular London such as Dickenss Oliver Twist and Bleak House. The jilted bride Miss Havisham from Great Expectations is one of Dickenss best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud. No other writer had such a profound influence on Dickens as William Shakespeare. On Dickenss veneration of Shakespeare Alfred Harbage wrote in A Kind of Power The Shakespeare-Dickens Analogy that No one is better qualified to recognise literary genius than a literary genius. Regarding Shakespeare as the great master whose plays were an unspeakable source of delight Dickenss lifelong affinity with the playwright included seeing theatrical productions of his plays in London and putting on amateur dramatics with friends in his early years. In 1838 Dickens travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon and visited the house in which Shakespeare was born leaving his autograph in the visitors book. Dickens would draw on this experience in his next work Nicholas Nickleby expressing the strength of feeling experienced by visitors to Shakespeares birthplace the character Mrs Wititterly states I dont know how it is but after youve seen the place and written your name in the little book somehow or other you seem to be inspired; it kindles up quite a fire within one. Dickenss writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity. Satire flourishing in his gift for caricature is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre. Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline giving what one critic calls an allegorical impetus to the novels meanings. To cite one of numerous examples the name Mr Murdstone in David Copperfield conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness. His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery he calls one character the Noble Refrigerator are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares people to tug boats or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickenss acclaimed flights of fancy. The author worked closely with his illustrators supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each months instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone illustrator of Our Mutual Friend recalled that the author was always ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics and... life-history of the creations of his fancy. Dickens employs Cockney English in many of his works denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as aint and consonants in words are frequently omitted as in ere and wot . An example of this usage is in Oliver Twist. The Artful Dodger uses cockney slang which is juxtaposed with Olivers proper English when the Dodger repeats Oliver saying seven with sivin. Dickenss biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare.Dickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge Tiny Tim Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit ; Oliver Twist The Artful Dodger Fagin and Bill Sikes ; Pip Miss Havisham and Abel Magwitch ; Sydney Carton Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge ; David Copperfield Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber ; Daniel Quilp and Nell Trent Samuel Pickwick and Sam Weller ; and Wackford Squeers are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture and in some cases have passed into ordinary language a scrooge for example is a miser or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity. His characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. Gamp became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp and Pickwickian Pecksniffian and Gradgrind all entered dictionaries due to Dickenss original portraits of such characters who were respectively quixotic hypocritical and vapidly factual. The character that made Dickens famous Sam Weller became known for his Wellerismsone-liners that turned proverbs on their heads. Many were drawn from real life Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother although she did not recognise herself in the portrait just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his fathers rhetorical exuberance; Harold Skimpole in Bleak House is based on James Henry Leigh Hunt; his wifes dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield. Perhaps Dickenss impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep . Virginia Woolf maintained that we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens as he produces characters who exist not in detail not accurately or exactly but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks.T. S. Eliot wrote that Dickens excelled in character; in the creation of characters of greater intensity than human beings. One character vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself. Dickens described London as a magic lantern inspiring the places and people in many of his novels. From the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the Thames all aspects of the capital Dickenss London are described over the course of his body of work. Walking the streets formed an integral part of his writing life stoking his creativity. Dickens was known to regularly walk at least a dozen miles per day and once wrote If I couldnt walk fast and far I should just explode and perish. Authors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. David Copperfield is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in Bleak House reflect Dickenss experiences as a law clerk and court reporter and in particular his direct experience of the laws procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright. Dickenss father was sent to prison for debt and this became a common theme in many of his books with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickenss own experiences of the institution. Lucy Stroughill a childhood sweetheart may have affected several of Dickenss portraits of girls such as Little Emly in David Copperfield and Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickenss own character which he sought to exorcise by self-parody. A pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as Master Humphreys Clock and Household Words later reprinted in book form. These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than previous. His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated. When The Old Curiosity Shop was being serialised American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship Is little Nell dead Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end. Another important impact of Dickenss episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation; he toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations cut long passages and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in Oliver Twist. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine. At the helm in popularising cliffhangers and serial publications in Victorian literature Dickenss influence can also be seen in television soap operas and film series with The Guardian stating that the DNA of Dickenss busy episodic storytelling delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions is traceable in everything. His serialisation of his novels also drew comments from other writers. In Scottish author Robert Louis Stevensons novel The Wrecker Captain Nares investigating an abandoned ship remarked See They were writing up the log said Nares pointing to the ink-bottle. Caught napping as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break like Charles Dickens and his serial novels. Dickenss novels were among other things works of social commentary. Simon Callow states From the moment he started to write he spoke for the people and the people loved him for it. He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address he expressed his belief that Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen. Dickenss second novel Oliver Twist shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime it challenged middle class polemics about criminals making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed. At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues such as sanitation and the workhouse but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in Hard Times Dickenss only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed Hands by the factory owners; that is not really people but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others in particular journalists and political figures to address such problems of class oppression. For example the prison scenes in The Pickwick Papers are claimed to have been influential in having the Fleet Prison shut down. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians publicists and moralists put together.George Bernard Shaw even remarked that Great Expectations was more seditious than Marxs Das Kapital. The exceptional popularity of Dickenss novels even those with socially oppositional themes not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an unruly superfluity of material that in the gradual dénouement yields up an unsuspected order influenced the organisation of Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species. Dickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in The Old Curiosity Shop was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell he said in a famous remark without dissolving into tears ... of laughter.G. K. Chesterton stated It is not the death of little Nell but the life of little Nell that I object to arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickenss grief his despotic use of peoples feelings to move them to tears in works like this. The question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the sentimental novel is debatable. Valerie Purton in her book Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition sees him continuing aspects of this tradition and argues that his sentimental scenes and characters Dickenss greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition. The Encyclopædia Britannica online comments that despite patches of emotional excess such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist. In Oliver Twist Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters this idealism serves only to highlight Dickenss goal of poignant social commentary. Dickenss fiction reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life makes frequent use of coincidence either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence. For example Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels such as Henry Fieldings Tom Jones which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth. Dickens was the most popular novelist of his time and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone out of print and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickenss works documented. Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime early productions included The Haunted Man which was performed in the West Ends Adelphi Theatre in 1848 and as early as 1901 the British silent film Scrooge or Marleys Ghost was made by Walter R. Booth. Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickenss popularity with cheap imitations of his novels resulting in his own popular penny dreadfuls. Dickens created some of the worlds best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the Victorian era. From the beginning of his career in the 1830s his achievements in English literature were compared to those of Shakespeare. Dickenss literary reputation however began to decline with the publication of Bleak House in 185253. Philip Collins calls Bleak House a crucial item in the history of Dickenss reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s 1860s and 1870s saw a drear decline in Dickens from a writer of bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social commentary.The Spectator called Bleak House a heavy book to read through at once ... dull and wearisome as a serial; Richard Simpson in The Rambler characterised Hard Times as this dreary framework; Frasers Magazine thought Little Dorrit decidedly the worst of his novels. All the same despite these increasing reservations amongst reviewers and the chattering classes the public never deserted its favourite. Dickenss popular reputation remained unchanged sales continued to rise and Household Words and later All the Year Round were highly successful. As his career progressed Dickenss fame and the demand for his public readings were unparalleled. In 1868 The Times wrote Amid all the variety of readings those of Mr Charles Dickens stand alone. A Dickens biographer Edgar Johnson wrote in the 1950s It was more than a reading; it was an extraordinary exhibition of acting that seized upon its auditors with a mesmeric possession. Juliet John backed the claim for Dickens to be called the first self-made global media star of the age of mass culture. Comparing his reception at public readings to those of a contemporary pop star The Guardian states People sometimes fainted at his shows. His performances even saw the rise of that modern phenomenon the speculator or ticket tout the ones in New York City escaped detection by borrowing respectable-looking hats from the waiters in nearby restaurants. Among fellow writers there was a range of opinions on Dickens. Poet laureate William Wordsworth thought him a very talkative vulgar young person adding he had not read a line of his work while novelist George Meredith found Dickens intellectually lacking. In 1888 Leslie Stephen commented in the Dictionary of National Biography that if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists.Anthony Trollopes Autobiography famously declared Thackeray not Dickens to be the greatest novelist of the age. However both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented We understand Dickens in Russia I am convinced almost as well as the English perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens and how very English Tolstoy referred to David Copperfield as his favourite book and he later adopted the novel as a model for his own autobiographical reflections. French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer writing his novels stand alone dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression. Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickenss novels in several of his paintings such as Vincents Chair and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens especially A Christmas Carol was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide. Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character while admiring his gift for caricature. Henry James denied him a premier position calling him the greatest of superficial novelists Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth and the novels loose baggy monsters betrayed a cavalier organisation.Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms noting he had an intense and unreasoning affection for Bleak House dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in The Secret Agent .Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with Dickens finding his novels mesmerizing while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style. Around 194041 the attitude of the literary critics began to warm towards Dickens led by George Orwell in Inside the Whale and Other Essays Edmund Wilson in The Wound and the Bow and Humphry House in Dickens and His World. However even in 1948 F. R. Leavis in The Great Tradition asserted that the adult mind doesnt as a rule find in Dickens a challenge to an unusual and sustained seriousness; Dickens was indeed a great genius but the genius was that of a great entertainer though he later changed his opinion with Dickens the Novelist Leavis Our purpose they wrote is to enforce as unanswerably as possible the conviction that Dickens was one of the greatest of creative writers. In 1944 Soviet film director and film theorist Sergei Eisenstein wrote an essay on Dickenss influence on cinema such as cross-cutting where two stories run alongside each other as seen in novels such as Oliver Twist. In the 1950s a substantial reassessment and re-editing of the works began and critics found his finest artistry and greatest depth to be in the later novels Bleak House Little Dorrit and Great Expectations and in Hard Times and Our Mutual Friend. Dickens was a favourite author of Roald Dahl; the best-selling childrens author would include three of Dickenss novels among those read by the title character in his 1988 novel Matilda. An avid reader of Dickens in 2005 Paul McCartney named Nicholas Nickleby his favourite novel. On Dickens he states I like the world that he takes me to. I like his words; I like the language adding A lot of my stuff its kind of Dickensian. Screenwriter Jonathan Nolans screenplay for The Dark Knight Rises was inspired by A Tale of Two Cities with Nolan calling the depiction of Paris in the novel one of the most harrowing portraits of a relatable recognisable civilisation that completely folded to pieces. On 7 February 2012 the 200th anniversary of Dickenss birth Philip Womack wrote in The Telegraph Today there is no escaping Charles Dickens. Not that there has ever been much chance of that before. He has a deep peculiar hold upon us. Museums and festivals celebrating Dickenss life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London the historic home where he wrote Oliver Twist The Pickwick Papers and Nicholas Nickleby; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels as well as printers proofs first editions and illustrations from the collection of Dickenss friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Dickenss will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled Dickens and Little Nell cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park in Sydney Australia. In 1960 a bas-relief sculpture of Dickens notably featuring characters from his books was commissioned from sculptor Estcourt J Clack to adorn the office building built on the site of his former home at 1 Devonshire Terrace London. In 2014 a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by his great-great-grandsons Ian and Gerald Dickens. A Christmas Carol is most probably his best-known story with frequent new adaptations. It is also the most-filmed of Dickenss stories with many versions dating from the early years of cinema. According to the historian Ronald Hutton the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by A Christmas Carol. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations as new middle-class expectations arose. Its archetypal figures entered into Western cultural consciousness. Merry Christmas a prominent phrase from the tale was popularised following the appearance of the story. The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser and his exclamation Bah Humbug a dismissal of the festive spirit likewise gained currency as an idiom. The Victorian era novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called the book a national benefit and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness. Dickens was commemorated on the Series E 10 note issued by the Bank of England that circulated between 1992 and 2003. His portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from The Pickwick Papers. The Charles Dickens School is a high school in Broadstairs Kent. A theme park Dickens World standing in part on the site of the former naval dockyard where Dickenss father once worked in the Navy Pay Office opened in Chatham in 2007. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens in 2012 the Museum of London held the UKs first major exhibition on the author in 40 years. In 2002 Dickens was number 41 in the BBCs poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Dickens among the greatest Western writers of all time. In the 2003 UK survey The Big Read carried out by the BBC five of Dickenss books were named in the Top 100. Actors who have portrayed Dickens on screen include Anthony Hopkins Derek Jacobi Simon Callow Dan Stevens and Ralph Fiennes the latter playing the author in The Invisible Woman which depicts Dickenss secret love affair with Ellen Ternan which lasted for thirteen years until his death in 1870. Dickens and his publications have appeared on a number of postage stamps in countries including the United Kingdom the Soviet Union Antigua Barbuda Botswana Cameroon Dubai Fujairah St Lucia and Turks and Caicos Islands St Vincent Nevis Alderney Gibraltar Jersey and Pitcairn Islands Austria and Mozambique . In 1976 a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honour. In November 2018 it was reported that a previously lost portrait of a 31-year-old Dickens by Margaret Gillies had been found in Pietermaritzburg South Africa. Gillies was an early supporter of womens suffrage and had painted the portrait in late 1843 when Dickens aged 31 wrote A Christmas Carol. It was exhibited to acclaim at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1844. The Charles Dickens Museum is reported to have paid 180000 for the portrait. Dickens published well over a dozen major novels and novellas a large number of short stories including a number of Christmas-themed stories a handful of plays and several non-fiction books. Dickenss novels and novellas were initially serialised in weekly and monthly magazines then reprinted in standard book formats.
Charlotte Brontë,Charlotte Brontë was an English novelist and poet the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of English literature. She enlisted in school at Roe Head Mirfield in January 1831 aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters Emily and Anne at home returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839 she undertook the role of governess for the Sidgwick family but left after a few months to return to Haworth where the sisters opened a school but failed to attract pupils. Instead they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer Ellis and Acton Bell. Although her first novel The Professor was rejected by publishers her second novel Jane Eyre was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848 and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles. Charlotte Brontë was the last to die of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855 almost certainly from hyperemesis gravidarum a complication of pregnancy which causes excessive nausea and vomiting. Charlotte Brontë was born on 21 April 1816 in Market Street Thornton west of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire the third of the six children of Maria and Patrick Brontë an Irish Anglican clergyman. In 1820 her family moved a few miles to the village of Haworth on the edge of the moors where her father had been appointed perpetual curate of St Michael and All Angels Church. Maria died of cancer on 15 September 1821 leaving five daughters Maria Elizabeth Charlotte Emily and Anne and a son Branwell to be taken care of by her sister Elizabeth Branwell. In August 1824 Patrick sent Charlotte Emily Maria and Elizabeth to the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire. Charlotte maintained that the schools poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and hastened the deaths of Maria and Elizabeth who both died of tuberculosis in June 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. Charlotte used the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre which is similarly affected by tuberculosis that is exacerbated by the poor conditions. At home in Haworth Parsonage Brontë acted as the motherly friend and guardian of her younger sisters. Brontë wrote her first known poem at the age of 13 in 1829 and was to go on to write more than 200 poems in the course of her life. Many of her poems were published in their homemade magazine Branwells Blackwoods Magazine and concerned the fictional world of Glass Town. She and her surviving siblings Branwell Emily and Anne created this shared world and began chronicling the lives and struggles of the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdom in 1827. Charlotte in private letters called Glass Town her world below a private escape where she could act out her desires and multiple identities. Charlottes predilection for romantic settings passionate relationships and high society is at odds with Branwells obsession with battles and politics and her young sisters homely North Country realism none the less at this stage there is still a sense of the writings as a family enterprise. However from 1831 onwards Emily and Anne seceded from the Glass Town Confederacy to create a spin-off called Gondal which included many of their poems. After 1831 Charlotte and Branwell concentrated on an evolution of the Glass Town Confederacy called Angria. Christine Alexander a Brontë juvenilia historian wrote both Charlotte and Branwell ensured the consistency of their imaginary world. When Branwell exuberantly kills off important characters in his manuscripts Charlotte comes to the rescue and in effect resurrects them for the next stories ; and when Branwell becomes bored with his inventions such as the Glass Town magazine he edits Charlotte takes over his initiative and keeps the publication going for several more years. The sagas the siblings created were episodic and elaborate and they exist in incomplete manuscripts some of which have been published as juvenilia. They provided them with an obsessive interest during childhood and early adolescence which prepared them for literary vocations in adulthood. Between 1831 and 1832 Brontë continued her education at a boarding school twenty miles away in Mirfield Roe Head where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor. In 1833 she wrote a novella The Green Dwarf using the name Wellesley. Around about 1833 her stories shifted from tales of the supernatural to more realistic stories. She returned to Roe Head as a teacher from 1835 to 1838. Unhappy and lonely as a teacher at Roe Head Brontë took out her sorrows in poetry writing a series of melancholic poems. In We wove a Web in Childhood written in December 1835 Brontë drew a sharp contrast between her miserable life as a teacher and the vivid imaginary worlds she and her siblings had created. In another poem Morning was its freshness still written at the same time Brontë wrote Tis bitter sometimes to recallIllusions once deemed fair. Many of her poems concerned the imaginary world of Angria often concerning Byronic heroes and in December 1836 she wrote to the Poet Laureate Robert Southey asking him for encouragement of her career as a poet. Southey replied famously that Literature cannot be the business of a womans life and it ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation. This advice she respected but did not heed. In 1839 she took up the first of many positions as governess to families in Yorkshire a career she pursued until 1841. In particular from May to July 1839 she was employed by the Sidgwick family at their summer residence Stone Gappe in Lothersdale where one of her charges was John Benson Sidgwick an unruly child who on one occasion threw the Bible at Charlotte an incident that may have been the inspiration for a part of the opening chapter of Jane Eyre in which John Reed throws a book at the young Jane. Brontë did not enjoy her work as a governess noting her employers treated her almost as a slave constantly humiliating her. Brontë was of slight build and was less than five feet tall. In 1842 Charlotte and Emily travelled to Brussels to enrol at the boarding school run by Constantin Héger and his wife Claire Zoé Parent Héger . During her time in Brussels Brontë who favoured the Protestant ideal of an individual in direct contact with God objected to the stern Catholicism of Madame Héger which she considered a tyrannical religion that enforced conformity and submission to the Pope. In return for board and tuition Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the school was cut short when their aunt Elizabeth Branwell who had joined the family in Haworth to look after the children after their mothers death died of internal obstruction in October 1842. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the school. Her second stay was not happy she was homesick and deeply attached to Constantin Héger. She returned to Haworth in January 1844 and used the time spent in Brussels as the inspiration for some of the events in The Professor and Villette. After returning to Haworth Charlotte and her sisters made headway with opening their own boarding school in the family home. It was advertised as The Misses Brontës Establishment for the Board and Education of a limited number of Young Ladies and inquiries were made to prospective pupils and sources of funding. But none were attracted and in October 1844 the project was abandoned. In May 1846 Charlotte Emily and Anne self-financed the publication of a joint collection of poems under their assumed names Currer Ellis and Acton Bell. The pseudonyms veiled the sisters sex while preserving their initials; thus Charlotte was Currer Bell. Bell was the middle name of Haworths curate Arthur Bell Nicholls whom Charlotte later married and Currer was the surname of Frances Mary Richardson Currer who had funded their school . Of the decision to use noms de plume Charlotte wrote Although only two copies of the collection of poems were sold the sisters continued writing for publication and began their first novels continuing to use their noms de plume when sending manuscripts to potential publishers. Brontës first manuscript The Professor did not secure a publisher although she was heartened by an encouraging response from Smith Elder Co. of Cornhill who expressed an interest in any longer works Currer Bell might wish to send. Brontë responded by finishing and sending a second manuscript in August 1847. Six weeks later Jane Eyre was published. It tells the story of a plain governess Jane who after difficulties in her early life falls in love with her employer Mr Rochester. They marry but only after Rochesters insane first wife of whom Jane initially has no knowledge dies in a dramatic house fire. The books style was innovative combining Romanticism naturalism with gothic melodrama and broke new ground in being written from an intensely evoked first-person female perspective. Brontë believed art was most convincing when based on personal experience; in Jane Eyre she transformed the experience into a novel with universal appeal. Jane Eyre had immediate commercial success and initially received favourable reviews. G. H. Lewes wrote that it was an utterance from the depths of a struggling suffering much-enduring spirit and declared that it consisted of suspiria de profundis . Speculation about the identity and gender of the mysterious Currer Bell heightened with the publication of Wuthering Heights by Ellis Bell and Agnes Grey by Acton Bell . Accompanying the speculation was a change in the critical reaction to Brontës work as accusations were made that the writing was coarse a judgement more readily made once it was suspected that Currer Bell was a woman. However sales of Jane Eyre continued to be strong and may even have increased as a result of the novel developing a reputation as an improper book. A talented amateur artist Brontë personally did the drawings for the second edition of Jane Eyre and in the summer of 1834 two of her paintings were shown at an exhibition by the Royal Northern Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Leeds. In 1848 Brontë began work on the manuscript of her second novel Shirley. It was only partially completed when the Brontë family suffered the deaths of three of its members within eight months. In September 1848 Branwell died of chronic bronchitis and marasmus exacerbated by heavy drinking although Brontë believed that his death was due to tuberculosis. Branwell may have had a laudanum addiction. Emily became seriously ill shortly after his funeral and died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848. Anne died of the same disease in May 1849. Brontë was unable to write at this time. After Annes death Brontë resumed writing as a way of dealing with her grief and Shirley which deals with themes of industrial unrest and the role of women in society was published in October 1849. Unlike Jane Eyre which is written in the first person Shirley is written in the third person and lacks the emotional immediacy of her first novel and reviewers found it less shocking. Brontë as her late sisters heir suppressed the republication of Annes second novel The Tenant of Wildfell Hall an action which had a deleterious effect on Annes popularity as a novelist and has remained controversial among the sisters biographers ever since. In view of the success of her novels particularly Jane Eyre Brontë was persuaded by her publisher to make occasional visits to London where she revealed her true identity and began to move in more exalted social circles becoming friends with Elizabeth Gaskell and Harriet Martineau whose sister Rachel had taught Gaskells daughters. Brontë sent an early copy of Shirley to Martineau whose home at Ambleside she visited. The two friends shared an interest in racial relations and the abolitionist movement; recurrent themes in their writings. Brontë was also acquainted with William Makepeace Thackeray and G.H. Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time as she did not want to leave her ageing father. Thackerays daughter writer Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie recalled a visit to her father by Brontë Brontës friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell while not particularly close was significant in that Gaskell wrote the first biography of Brontë after her death in 1855. Brontës third novel the last published in her lifetime was Villette which appeared in 1853. Its main themes include isolation how such a condition can be borne and the internal conflict brought about by social repression of individual desire. Its main character Lucy Snowe travels abroad to teach in a boarding school in the fictional town of Villette where she encounters a culture and religion different from her own and falls in love with a man whom she cannot marry. Her experiences result in a breakdown but eventually she achieves independence and fulfilment through running her own school. A substantial amount of the novels dialogue is in the French language. Villette marked Brontës return to writing from a first-person perspective the technique she had used in Jane Eyre. Another similarity to Jane Eyre lies in the use of aspects of her own life as inspiration for fictional events in particular her reworking of the time she spent at the pensionnat in Brussels. Villette was acknowledged by critics of the day as a potent and sophisticated piece of writing although it was criticised for coarseness and for not being suitably feminine in its portrayal of Lucys desires. Before the publication of Villette Brontë received an expected proposal of marriage from Irishman Arthur Bell Nicholls her fathers curate who had long been in love with her. She initially refused him and her father objected to the union at least partly because of Nichollss poor financial status. Elizabeth Gaskell who believed that marriage provided clear and defined duties that were beneficial for a woman encouraged Brontë to consider the positive aspects of such a union and tried to use her contacts to engineer an improvement in Nichollss finances. According to James Pope-Hennessy in The Flight of Youth it was the generosity of Richard Monckton Milnes that made the marriage possible. Brontë meanwhile was increasingly attracted to Nicholls and by January 1854 she had accepted his proposal. They gained the approval of her father by April and married in June. Her father Patrick had intended to give Charlotte away but at the last minute decided he could not and Charlotte had to make her way to the church without him. The married couple took their honeymoon in Banagher County Offaly Ireland. By all accounts her marriage was a success and Brontë found herself very happy in a way that was new to her. Brontë became pregnant soon after her wedding but her health declined rapidly and according to Gaskell she was attacked by sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness. She died with her unborn child on 31 March 1855 three weeks before her 39th birthday. Her death certificate gives the cause of death as phthisis but biographers including Claire Harman and others suggest that she died from dehydration and malnourishment due to vomiting caused by severe morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum. Brontë was buried in the family vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels at Haworth. The Professor the first novel Brontë had written was published posthumously in 1857. The fragment of a new novel she had been writing in her last years has been twice completed by recent authors the more famous version being Emma Brown A Novel from the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Brontë by Clare Boylan in 2003. Most of her writings about the imaginary country Angria have also been published since her death. In 2018 The New York Times published a belated obituary for her. The daughter of an Irish Anglican clergyman Brontë was herself an Anglican. In a letter to her publisher she claims to love the Church of England. Her Ministers indeed I do not regard as infallible personages I have seen too much of them for that but to the Establishment with all her faults the profane Athanasian Creed excluded I am sincerely attached. If I could always live with you and daily read the bible with you if your lips and mine could at the same time drink the same draught from the same pure fountain of Mercy I hope I trust I might one day become better far better than my evil wandering thoughts my corrupt heart cold to the spirit and warm to the flesh will now permit me to be. Elizabeth Gaskells biography The Life of Charlotte Brontë was published in 1857. It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another and Gaskells approach was unusual in that rather than analysing her subjects achievements she concentrated on private details of Brontës life emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of coarseness that had been levelled at her writing. The biography is frank in places but omits details of Brontës love for Héger a married man as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Brontës father widower and friends. Mrs. Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Brontë claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Brontës diary papers in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage. It has been argued that Gaskells approach transferred the focus of attention away from the difficult novels not just Brontës but all the sisters and began a process of sanctification of their private lives. Brontë held lifelong correspondence with her former schoolmate Ellen Nussey. 350 of the some 500 letters sent by Brontë to Nussey survive whereas all of Nusseys letters to Brontë were burned at Nichollss request. The surviving letters provide most of the information known on Charlotte Brontës life and are the backbone of her autobiographies. Brontës letters to Nussey seem to have romantic undertones What shall I do without you How long are we likely to be separated Why are we to be denied each others society- I long to be with you. Why are we to be divided Surely Ellen it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well- Ellen I wish I could live with you always. I begin to cling to you more fondly than ever I did. If we had but a cottage and a competency of our own I do think we might live and love on till Death without being dependent on any third person for happiness... Some scholars believe it is possible that Charlotte Brontë was in a romantic or sexual relationship with Ellen Nussey. Brontë would certainly have been aware of female same-sex attraction as she lived near Anne Lister. On 29 July 1913 The Times of London printed four letters Brontë had written to Constantin Héger after leaving Brussels in 1844. Written in French except for one postscript in English the letters broke the prevailing image of Brontë as an angelic martyr to Christian and female duties that had been constructed by many biographers beginning with Gaskell. The letters which formed part of a larger and somewhat one-sided correspondence in which Héger frequently appears not to have replied reveal that she had been in love with a married man although they are complex and have been interpreted in numerous ways including as an example of literary self-dramatisation and an expression of gratitude from a former pupil. In 1980 a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the Centre for Fine Arts Brussels on the site of the Madam Hegers school in honour of Charlotte and Emily. The Green Dwarf A Tale of the Perfect Tense was written in 1833 under the pseudonym Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley. It shows the influence of Walter Scott and Brontës modifications to her earlier gothic style have led Christine Alexander to comment that in the work it is clear that Brontë was becoming tired of the gothic mode per se.
Emily Brontë,Emily Jane Brontë was an English novelist and poet who is best known for her only novel Wuthering Heights now considered a classic of English literature. She also published a book of poetry with her sisters Charlotte and Anne titled Poems by Currer Ellis and Acton Bell with her own poems finding regard as poetic genius. Emily was the second-youngest of the four surviving Brontë siblings between the youngest Anne and her brother Branwell. She published under the pen name Ellis Bell. Emily Brontë was born on 30 July 1818 to Maria Branwell and an Irish father Patrick Brontë. The family was living on Market Street in the village of Thornton on the outskirts of Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire England. Emily was the second youngest of six siblings preceded by Maria Elizabeth Charlotte and Branwell. In 1820 Emilys younger sister Anne the last Brontë child was born. Shortly thereafter the family moved eight miles away to Haworth where Patrick was employed as perpetual curate. In Haworth the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents. When Emily was only three and all six children under the age of eight she and her siblings lost their mother Maria to cancer on 15 September 1821. The younger children were to be cared for by Elizabeth Branwell their aunt and Marias sister. Emilys three elder sisters Maria Elizabeth and Charlotte were sent to the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six on 25 November 1824 Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period. At school however the children suffered abuse and privations and when a typhoid epidemic swept the school Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria who may actually have had tuberculosis was sent home where she died. Elizabeth died shortly after. The four youngest Brontë children all under ten years of age had suffered the loss of the three eldest women in their immediate family. Charlotte maintained that the schools poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria and Elizabeth who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in Jane Eyre. The three remaining sisters and their brother Branwell were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt Elizabeth Branwell. A shy girl Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside. Despite the lack of formal education Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included Sir Walter Scott Byron Shelley and Blackwoods Magazine. Inspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift the children began to write stories which they set in a number of invented imaginary worlds populated by their soldiers as well as their heroes the Duke of Wellington and his sons Charles and Arthur Wellesley. Little of Emilys work from this period survives except for poems spoken by characters. Initially all four children shared in creating stories about a world called Angria. However when Emily was 13 she and Anne withdrew from participation in the Angria story and began a new one about Gondal a fictional island whose myths and legends were to preoccupy the two sisters throughout their lives. With the exception of their Gondal poems and Annes lists of Gondals characters and placenames Emily and Annes Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some diary papers written by Emily in her twenties which describe current events in Gondal. The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander a sort of British version of the noble savage romantic outlaws capable of more nobility passion and bravery than the denizens of civilization. Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Brontës juvenilia notably in Branwells The Life of Alexander Percy which tells the story of an all-consuming death-defying and ultimately self-destructive love and is generally considered an inspiration for Wuthering Heights. At seventeen Emily began to attend the Roe Head Girls School where Charlotte was a teacher but suffered from extreme homesickness and left after only a few months. Charlotte wrote later that Liberty was the breath of Emilys nostrils; without it she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life to one of disciplined routine was what she failed in enduring... I felt in my heart she would die if she did not go home and with this conviction obtained her recall. Emily returned home and Anne took her place. At this time the girls objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own. Emily became a teacher at Law Hill School in Halifax beginning in September 1838 when she was twenty. Her always fragile health soon broke under the stress of the 17-hour workday and she returned home in April 1839. Thereafter she remained at home doing most of the cooking ironing and cleaning at Haworth. She taught herself German out of books and also practised the piano. In 1842 Emily accompanied Charlotte to the Héger Pensionnat in Brussels Belgium where they attended the girls academy run by Constantin Héger in the hope of perfecting their French and German before opening their school. Unlike Charlotte Emily was uncomfortable in Brussels and refused to adopt Belgian fashions saying I wish to be as God made me which rendered her something of an outcast. Nine of Emilys French essays survive from this period. Héger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emilys character writing that The two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame Héger proposed that they both stay another half-year even according to Charlotte offering to dismiss the English master so that she could take his place. Emily had by this time become a competent pianist and teacher and it was suggested that she might stay on to teach music. However the illness and death of their aunt drove them to return to their father and Haworth. In 1844 the sisters attempted to open a school in their house but their plans were stymied by an inability to attract students to the remote area. In 1844 Emily began going through all the poems she had written recopying them neatly into two notebooks. One was labelled Gondal Poems; the other was unlabelled. Scholars such as Fannie Ratchford and Derek Roper have attempted to piece together a Gondal storyline and chronology from these poems.In the autumn of 1845 Charlotte discovered the notebooks and insisted that the poems be published. Emily furious at the invasion of her privacy at first refused but relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte that she had been writing poems in secret as well. As co-authors of Gondal stories Anne and Emily were accustomed to read their Gondal stories and poems to each other while Charlotte was excluded from their privacy. Around this time Emily had written one of her most famous poems No coward soul is mine probably as an answer to the violation of her privacy and her own transformation into a published writer. Despite Charlottes later claim it was not her last poem. In 1846 the sisters poems were published in one volume as Poems by Currer Ellis and Acton Bell. The Brontë sisters had adopted pseudonyms for publication preserving their initials Charlotte was Currer Bell Emily was Ellis Bell and Anne was Acton Bell. Charlotte wrote in the Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell that their ambiguous choice was dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine while we did not like to declare ourselves women because... we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice. Charlotte contributed 19 poems and Emily and Anne each contributed 21. Although the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies had sold they were not discouraged .The Athenaeum reviewer praised Ellis Bells work for its music and power singling out his poems as the best Ellis possesses a fine quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted and The Critic reviewer recognised the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect. Emily Brontës solitary and reclusive nature has made her a mysterious figure and a challenge for biographers to assess. Except for Ellen Nussey and Louise de Bassompierre Emilys fellow student in Brussels she does not seem to have made any friends outside her family. Her closest friend was her sister Anne. Together they shared their own fantasy world Gondal and according to Ellen Nussey in childhood they were like twins inseparable companions and in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption. In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the five years she spent as governess. A plan to visit Scarborough fell through and instead the sisters went to York where Anne showed Emily York Minster. During the trip the sisters acted out some of their Gondal characters. Charlotte Brontë remains the primary source of information about Emily although as an elder sister writing publicly about her only shortly after her death she is considered by certain scholars not to be a neutral witness. Stevie Davies believes that there is what might be called Charlottes smoke-screen and argues that Emily evidently shocked her to the point where she may even have doubted her sisters sanity. After Emilys death Charlotte rewrote her character history and even poems on a more acceptable model. Biographer Claire OCallaghan suggests that the trajectory of Brontës legacy was altered significantly by Elizabeth Gaskells biography of Charlotte concerning not only because Gaskell did not visit Haworth until after Emilys death but also because Gaskell admits to disliking what she did know of Emily in her biography of Charlotte. As OCallaghan and others have noted Charlotte was Gaskells primary source of information on Emilys life and may have exaggerated or fabricated Emilys frailty and shyness to cast herself in the role of maternal saviour. Charlotte presented Emily as someone whose natural love of the beauties of nature had become somewhat exaggerated owing to her shy nature portraying her as too fond of the Yorkshire moors and homesick whenever she was away. According to Lucasta Miller in her analysis of Brontë biographies Charlotte took on the role of Emilys first mythographer. In the Preface to the Second Edition of Wuthering Heights in 1850 Charlotte wrote My sisters disposition was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her tendency to seclusion; except to go to church or take a walk on the hills she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent intercourse with them she never sought; nor with very few exceptions ever experienced. And yet she knew them knew their ways their language their family histories; she could hear of them with interest and talk of them with detail minute graphic and accurate; but WITH them she rarely exchanged a word. Emilys unsociability and extremely shy nature have subsequently been reported many times. According to Norma Crandall her warm human aspect was usually revealed only in her love of nature and of animals. In a similar description Literary news states had the most intimate relations and from her walks she often came with fledgling or young rabbit in hand talking softly to it quite sure too that it understood. Elizabeth Gaskell in her biography of Charlotte told the story of Emilys punishing her pet dog Keeper for lying on the delicate white counterpane that covered one of the beds in the Parsonage. According to Gaskell she struck him with her fists until he was half-blind with his eyes swelled up. This story is apocryphal and contradicts the following account of Emilys and Keepers relationship Poor old Keeper Emilys faithful friend and worshipper seemed to understand her like a human being. One evening when the four friends were sitting closely round the fire in the sitting-room Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emilys lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guests knees making himself quite comfortable. Emilys heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor little guessing that she herself being in close contact was the inspiring cause of submission to Keepers preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keepermake him frantic in action and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emilys funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness. In Queens of Literature of the Victorian Era Eva Hope summarises Emilys character as a peculiar mixture of timidity and Spartan-like courage and goes on to say She was painfully shy but physically she was brave to a surprising degree. She loved few persons but those few with a passion of self-sacrificing tenderness and devotion. To other peoples failings she was understanding and forgiving but over herself she kept a continual and most austere watch never allowing herself to deviate for one instant from what she considered her duty. Emily Brontë has often been characterised as a devout if somewhat unorthodox Christian a heretic and a visionary mystic of the moors. Emily Brontës Wuthering Heights was first published in London in 1847 by Thomas Cautley Newby appearing as the first two volumes of a three-volume set that included Anne Brontës Agnes Grey. The authors were printed as being Ellis and Acton Bell; Emilys real name did not appear until 1850 when it was printed on the title page of an edited commercial edition. The novels innovative structure somewhat puzzled critics. Wuthering Heightss violence and passion led the Victorian public and many early reviewers to think that it had been written by a man. According to Juliet Gardiner the vivid sexual passion and power of its language and imagery impressed bewildered and appalled reviewers. Literary critic Thomas Joudrey further contextualizes this reaction Expecting in the wake of Charlotte Brontës Jane Eyre to be swept up in an earnest Bildungsroman they were instead shocked and confounded by a tale of unchecked primal passions replete with savage cruelty and outright barbarism. Even though the novel received mixed reviews when it first came out and was often condemned for its portrayal of amoral passion the book subsequently became an English literary classic. Emily Brontë never knew the extent of fame she achieved with her only novel as she died a year after its publication aged 30. Although a letter from her publisher indicates that Emily had begun to write a second novel the manuscript has never been found. Perhaps Emily or a member of her family eventually destroyed the manuscript if it existed when she was prevented by illness from completing it. It has also been suggested that though less likely the letter could have been intended for Anne Brontë who was already writing The Tenant of Wildfell Hall her second novel. Emilys health was probably weakened by the harsh local climate and by unsanitary conditions at home where water was contaminated by run off from the churchs graveyard. Branwell died suddenly on Sunday 24 September 1848. At his funeral service a week later Emily caught a severe cold that quickly developed into inflammation of the lungs and led to tuberculosis. Though her condition worsened steadily she rejected medical help and all offered remedies saying that she would have no poisoning doctor near her. On the morning of 19 December 1848 Charlotte fearing for her sister wrote She grows daily weaker. The physicians opinion was expressed too obscurely to be of use he sent some medicine which she would not take. Moments so dark as these I have never known I pray for Gods support to us all. At noon Emily was worse; she could only whisper in gasps. With her last audible words she said to Charlotte If you will send for a doctor I will see him now but it was too late. She died that same day at about two in the afternoon. According to Mary Robinson an early biographer of Emily it happened while she was sitting on the sofa. However Charlottes letter to William Smith Williams where she mentions Emilys dog Keeper lying at the side of her dying-bed makes this statement seem unlikely. It was less than three months after Branwells death which led Martha Brown a housemaid to declare that Miss Emily died of a broken heart for love of her brother. Emily had grown so thin that her coffin measured only 16 inches wide. The carpenter said he had never made a narrower one for an adult. Her remains were interred in the family vault in St Michael and All Angels Church Haworth. The English folk group The Unthanks released Lines a trilogy of short albums which includes settings of Brontës poems to music and was recorded at the Brontës parsonage home using their own Regency era piano played by Adrian McNally. In the 2019 film How to Build a Girl Emily and Charlotte Brontë are among the historical figures in Johannas wall collage. In May 2021 the contents of the Honresfield library a collection of rare books and manuscripts first assembled by Rochdale mill owners Alfred and William Law re-emerged after being out of public view for nearly a century. In the collection were handwritten poems by Emily Brontë as well as the Brontë family edition of Bewicks History of British Birds. The collection was to be auctioned off at Sothebys and was estimated to sell for 1million. The 1946 film Devotion was a highly fictionalized account of the lives of the Brontë sisters. In the 2022 film Emily written and directed by Frances OConnor Emma Mackey plays Emily before the publication of Wuthering Heights. The film mixes known biographical details with imagined situations and relationships.
George Eliot,Mary Ann Evans known by her pen name George Eliot was an English novelist poet journalist translator and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. She wrote seven novels Adam Bede The Mill on the Floss Silas Marner Romola Felix Holt the Radical Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda . Like Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy she emerged from provincial England; most of her works are set there. Her works are known for their realism psychological insight sense of place and detailed depiction of the countryside. Middlemarch was described by the novelist Virginia Woolf as one of the few English novels written for grown-up people and by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language. Mary Ann Evans was born in Nuneaton Warwickshire England at South Farm on the Arbury Hall estate. She was the third child of Robert Evans manager of the Arbury Hall estate and Christiana Evans daughter of a local mill-owner. Her full siblings were Christiana known as Chrissey Isaac and twin brothers who died a few days after birth in March 1821. She also had a half-brother Robert Evans and half-sister Frances Fanny Evans Houghton from her fathers previous marriage to Harriet Poynton . In early 1820 the family moved to a house named Griff House between Nuneaton and Bedworth. The young Evans was a voracious reader and obviously intelligent. Because she was not considered physically beautiful Evans was not thought to have much chance of marriage and this coupled with her intelligence led her father to invest in an education not often afforded women. From ages five to nine she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Lathams school in Attleborough from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallingtons school in Nuneaton and from ages 13 to 16 at Miss Franklins school in Coventry. At Mrs. Wallingtons school she was taught by the evangelical Maria Lewisto whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Misses Franklins school Evans was exposed to a quiet disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism. After age sixteen Evans had little formal education. Thanks to her fathers important role on the estate she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that George Eliots novels draw heavily on Greek literature and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy. Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a low church Anglican family but at that time the Midlands was an area with a growing number of religious dissenters. In 1836 her mother died and Evans returned home to act as housekeeper but she continued correspondence with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21 her brother Isaac married and took over the family home so Evans and her father moved to Foleshill near Coventry. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. Charles Bray had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time became intimate friends with the radical free-thinking Brays whose Rosehill home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays house included Robert Owen Herbert Spencer Harriet Martineau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal and agnostic theologies and to writers such as David Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical texts. In fact her first major literary work was an English translation of Strausss Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet as The Life of Jesus Critically Examined which she completed after it had been left incomplete by Elizabeth Rufa Brabant another member of the Rosehill Circle. The Strauss book had caused a sensation in Germany by arguing that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical additions with little basis in fact. Evanss translation had a similar effect in England the Earl of Shaftesbury calling her translation the most pestilential book ever vomited out of the jaws of hell. Later she translated Feuerbachs The Essence of Christianity . The ideas in these books would have an effect on her own fiction as detailed below. As a product of their friendship Bray published some of Evanss own earliest writing such as reviews in his newspaper the Coventry Herald and Observer. As Evans began to question her own religious faith her father threatened to throw her out of the house but his threat was not carried out. Instead she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849 when she was 30. Five days after her fathers funeral she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in Geneva alone living first on the lake at Plongeon and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends François and Juliet dAlbert Durade on the rue de Chanoines . She commented happily that one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree. Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside which was a great inspiration to her. François Durade painted her portrait there as well. On her return to England the following year she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans. She stayed at the house of John Chapman the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning left-wing journal The Westminster Review. Evans became its assistant editor in 1851 after joining just a year earlier. Evanss writings for the paper were comments on her views of society and the Victorian way of thinking. She was sympathetic to the lower classes and criticised organised religion throughout her articles and reviews and commented on contemporary ideas of the time. Much of this was drawn from her own experiences and knowledge and she used this to critique other ideas and organisations. This led to her writing being viewed as authentic and wise but not too obviously opinionated. Evans also focused on the business side of the Review with attempts to change its layout and design. Although Chapman was officially the editor it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the Review in the first half of 1854. Eliot sympathized with the 1848 Revolutions throughout continental Europe and even hoped that the Italians would chase the odious Austrians out of Lombardy and that decayed monarchs would be pensioned off although she believed a gradual reformist approach to social problems was best for England. In 185051 Evans attended classes in mathematics at the Ladies College in Bedford Square later known as Bedford College London. The philosopher and critic George Henry Lewes met Evans in 1851 and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis although in an open marriage. In addition to the three children they had together Agnes also had four children by Thornton Leigh Hunt. In July 1854 Lewes and Evans travelled to Weimar and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbachs The Essence of Christianity and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of Baruch Spinozas Ethics which she completed in 1856 but which was not published in her lifetime because the prospective publisher refused to pay the requested 75. In 1981 Eliots translation of Spinozas Ethics was finally published by Thomas Deegan and was determined to be in the public domain in 2018 and published by the George Eliot Archive. It has been re-published in 2020 by Princeton University Press. The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes who subsequently considered themselves married. Evans began to refer to Lewes as her husband and to sign her name as Mary Ann Evans Lewes legally changing her name to Mary Ann Evans Lewes after his death. The refusal to conceal the relationship was contrary to the social conventions of the time and attracted considerable disapproval. While continuing to contribute pieces to the Westminster Review Evans resolved to become a novelist and set out a pertinent manifesto in one of her last essays for the Review Silly Novels by Lady Novelists . The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction written by women. In other essays she praised the realism of novels that were being written in Europe at the time an emphasis on realistic storytelling confirmed in her own subsequent fiction. She also adopted a nom-de-plume George Eliot; as she explained to her biographer J. W. Cross George was Lewess forename and Eliot was a good mouth-filling easily pronounced word. Although female authors were published under their own names during her lifetime she wanted to escape the stereotype of womens writing being limited to lighthearted romances or other lighter fare not to be taken very seriously. She also wanted to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as a translator editor and critic. Another factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny thus avoiding the scandal that would have arisen because of her relationship with Lewes who was married. In 1857 when she was 37 years of age The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton the first of the three stories included in Scenes of Clerical Life and the first work of George Eliot was published in Blackwoods Magazine.The Scenes was well received and was widely believed to have been written by a country parson or perhaps the wife of a parson. Eliot was profoundly influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle. As early as 1841 she referred to him as a grand favourite of mine and references to him abound in her letters from the 1840s and 1850s. According to University of Victoria professor Lisa Surridge Carlyle stimulated Eliots interest in German thought encouraged her turn from Christian orthodoxy and shaped her ideas on work duty sympathy and the evolution of the self. These themes made their way into Evanss first complete novel Adam Bede . It was an instant success and prompted yet more intense curiosity as to the authors identity there was even a pretender to the authorship one Joseph Liggins. This public interest subsequently led to Marian Evans Lewess acknowledgment that it was she who stood behind the pseudonym George Eliot. Adam Bede is known for embracing a realist aesthetic inspired by Dutch visual art. The revelations about Eliots private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Her relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she needed to write fiction but it would be some time before the couple were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to Princess Louise the daughter of Queen Victoria. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of Eliots novels and was so impressed with Adam Bede that she commissioned the artist Edward Henry Corbould to paint scenes from the book. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861 Eliot expressed sympathy for the Union cause something which historians have attributed to her abolitionist sympathies. In 1868 she supported philosopher Richard Congreves protests against governmental policies in Ireland and had a positive view of the growing movement in support of Irish home rule. She was influenced by the writings of John Stuart Mill and read all of his major works as they were published. In Mills The Subjection of Women she judged the second chapter excoriating the laws which oppress married women excellent. She was supportive of Mills parliamentary run but believed that the electorate was unlikely to vote for a philosopher and was surprised when he won. While Mill served in parliament she expressed her agreement with his efforts on behalf of female suffrage being inclined to hope for much good from the serious presentation of womens claims before Parliament. In a letter to John Morley she declared her support for plans which held out reasonable promise of tending to establish as far as possible an equivalence of advantage for the two sexes as to education and the possibilities of free development and dismissed appeals to nature in explaining womens lower status. In 1870 she responded enthusiastically to Lady Amberleys feminist lecture on the claims of women for education occupations equality in marriage and child custody. However it would not be correct to assume that the female protagonists of her works can be considered feminist with the sole exception perhaps of Romola de Bardi who resolutely rejects the State and Church obligations of her time. After the success of Adam Bede Eliot continued to write popular novels for the next fifteen years. Within a year of completing Adam Bede she finished The Mill on the Floss dedicating the manuscript To my beloved husband George Henry Lewes I give this MS. of my third book written in the sixth year of our life together at Holly Lodge South Field Wandsworth and finished 21 March 1860. Silas Marner and Romola soon followed and later Felix Holt the Radical and her most acclaimed novel Middlemarch . Her last novel was Daniel Deronda published in 1876 after which she and Lewes moved to Witley Surrey. By this time Lewess health was failing and he died two years later on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next two years editing Lewess final work Life and Mind for publication and found solace and companionship with John Walter Cross a Scottish commission agent 20 years her junior whose mother had recently died. On 16 May 1880 Eliot married John Walter Cross and again changed her name this time to Mary Ann Cross. While the marriage courted some controversy due to the difference in ages it pleased her brother Isaac who had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes and now sent congratulations. While the couple were honeymooning in Venice Cross in a reported suicide attempt jumped from the hotel balcony into the Grand Canal. He survived and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection. This coupled with the kidney disease with which she had been afflicted for several years led to her death on 22 December 1880 at the age of 61. Due to her denial of the Christian faith and her relationship with Lewes Eliot was not buried in Westminster Abbey. She was instead interred in Highgate Cemetery Highgate London in the area reserved for political and religious dissenters and agnostics beside the love of her life George Henry Lewes. The graves of Karl Marx and her friend Herbert Spencer are nearby. In 1980 on the centenary of her death a memorial stone was established for her in the Poets Corner between W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas with a quote from Scenes of Clerical Life The first condition of human goodness is something to love; the second something to reverence. Several landmarks in her birthplace of Nuneaton are named in her honour. These include the George Eliot Academy Middlemarch Junior School George Eliot Hospital and George Eliot Road in Foleshill Coventry. A statue of Eliot is in Newdegate Street Nuneaton and Nuneaton Museum Art Gallery has a display of artifacts related to her. A tunnel boring machine constructing the Bromford Tunnel on High Speed 2 was named in honour of her.  Throughout her career Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From Adam Bede to The Mill on the Floss and Silas Marner Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. Felix Holt the Radical and The Legend of Jubal were overtly political and political crisis is at the heart of Middlemarch in which she presents the stories of a number of inhabitants of a small English town on the eve of the Reform Bill of 1832; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of John Ruskins Modern Painters in Westminster Review in 1856. Readers in the Victorian era praised her novels for their depictions of rural society. Much of the material for her prose was drawn from her own experience. She shared with Wordsworth the belief that there was much value and beauty to be found in the mundane details of ordinary country life. Eliot did not however confine herself to stories of the English countryside. Romola an historical novel set in late fifteenth century Florence was based on the life of the Italian priest Girolamo Savonarola. In The Spanish Gypsy Eliot made a foray into verse but her poetrys initial popularity has not endured. Working as a translator Eliot was exposed to German texts of religious social and moral philosophy such as David Friedrich Strausss Life of Jesus and Feuerbachs The Essence of Christianity; also important was her translation from Latin of Jewish-Dutch philosopher Spinozas Ethics. Elements from these works show up in her fiction much of which is written with her trademark sense of agnostic humanism. According to Clare Carlisle who published a new biography on George Eliot in 2023 the overdue publication of Spinozas Ethics was a real shame because it could have provided some illuminating cues for understanding the more mature works of the writer. She had taken particular notice of Feuerbachs conception of Christianity positing that our understanding of the nature of the divine was to be found ultimately in the nature of humanity projected onto a divine figure. An example of this philosophy appeared in her novel Romola in which Eliots protagonist displayed a surprisingly modern readiness to interpret religious language in humanist or secular ethical terms. Though Eliot herself was not religious she had respect for religious tradition and its ability to maintain a sense of social order and morality. The religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from The Mill on the Floss sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans. Eliot also faced a quandary similar to that of Silas Marner whose alienation from the church simultaneously meant his alienation from society. Because Eliot retained a vestigial respect for religion German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche excoriated her system of morality for figuring sin as a debt that can be expiated through suffering which he demeaned as characteristic of little moralistic females à la Eliot. She was at her most autobiographical in Looking Backwards part of her final published work Impressions of Theophrastus Such. By the time of Daniel Deronda Eliots sales were falling off and she had faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the posthumous biography written by her husband which portrayed a wonderful almost saintly woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics most notably by Virginia Woolf who called Middlemarch one of the few English novels written for grown-up people. In 1994 literary critic Harold Bloom placed Eliot among the most important Western writers of all time. In a 2007 authors poll by Time Middlemarch was voted the tenth greatest literary work ever written. In 2015 writers from outside the UK voted it first among all British novels by a landslide. The various film and television adaptations of Eliots books have re-introduced her to the wider reading public.
Matthew Arnold,Matthew Arnold was an English poet and cultural critic who worked as an inspector of schools. He was the son of Thomas Arnold the celebrated headmaster of Rugby School and brother to both Tom Arnold literary professor and William Delafield Arnold novelist and colonial administrator. Matthew Arnold has been characterised as a sage writer a type of writer who chastises and instructs the reader on contemporary social issues. He was also an inspector of schools for thirty-five years and supported the concept of state-regulated secondary education. He was the eldest son of Thomas Arnold and his wife Mary Penrose Arnold born on 24 December 1822 at Laleham-on-Thames Middlesex.John Keble stood as godfather to Matthew. In 1828 Thomas Arnold was appointed Headmaster of Rugby School where the family took up residence that year. From 1831 Arnold was tutored by his clerical uncle John Buckland in Laleham. In 1834 the Arnolds occupied a holiday home Fox How in the Lake District. There William Wordsworth was a neighbour and close friend. In 1836 Arnold was sent to Winchester College but in 1837 he returned to Rugby School. He moved to the sixth form in 1838 and so came under the direct tutelage of his father. He wrote verse for a family magazine and won school prizes. His prize poem Alaric at Rome was printed at Rugby. In November 1840 aged 17 Arnold matriculated at Balliol College Oxford where in 1841 he won an open scholarship graduating B.A. in 1844. During his student years at Oxford his friendship became stronger with Arthur Hugh Clough a Rugby pupil who had been one of his fathers favourites. He attended John Henry Newmans sermons at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin but did not join the Oxford Movement. After his fathers death in 1842 Fox How became the familys permanent residence. His poem Cromwell won the 1843 Newdigate prize. He graduated in the following year with second class honours in Literae Humaniores. In 1845 after a short interlude of teaching at Rugby Arnold was elected Fellow of Oriel College Oxford. In 1847 he became Private Secretary to Lord Lansdowne Lord President of the Council. In 1849 he published his first book of poetry The Strayed Reveller. In 1850 Wordsworth died; Arnold published his Memorial Verses on the older poet in Frasers Magazine. Wishing to marry but unable to support a family on the wages of a private secretary Arnold sought the position of and was appointed in April 1851 one of Her Majestys Inspectors of Schools. Two months later he married Frances Lucy daughter of Sir William Wightman Justice of the Queens Bench. Arnold often described his duties as a school inspector as drudgery although at other times he acknowledged the benefit of regular work. The inspectorship required him at least at first to travel constantly and across much of England. Initially Arnold was responsible for inspecting Nonconformist schools across a broad swath of central England. He spent many dreary hours during the 1850s in railway waiting rooms and small-town hotels and longer hours still listening to children reciting their lessons and parents reciting their grievances. But that also meant that he among the first generation of the railway age traveled across more of England than any man of letters had ever done. Although his duties were later confined to a smaller area Arnold knew the society of provincial England better than most of the metropolitan authors and politicians of the day. In 1852 Arnold published his second volume of poems Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems. In 1853 he published Poems A New Edition a selection from the two earlier volumes famously excluding Empedocles on Etna but adding new poems Sohrab and Rustum and The Scholar Gipsy. In 1854 Poems Second Series appeared; also a selection it included the new poem Balder Dead. Arnold was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford in 1857 and he was the first in this position to deliver his lectures in English rather than in Latin. He was re-elected in 1862. On Translating Homer and the initial thoughts that Arnold would transform into Culture and Anarchy were among the fruits of the Oxford lectures. In 1859 he conducted the first of three trips to the continent at the behest of parliament to study European educational practices. He self-published The Popular Education of France the introduction to which was later published under the title Democracy . In 1865 Arnold published Essays in Criticism First Series. Essays in Criticism Second Series would not appear until November 1888 shortly after his death. In 1866 he published Thyrsis his elegy to Clough who had died in 1861. Culture and Anarchy Arnolds major work in social criticism was published in 1869. Literature and Dogma Arnolds major work in religious criticism appeared in 1873. In 1883 and 1884 Arnold toured the United States and Canada delivering lectures on education democracy and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1883. In 1886 he retired from school inspection and made another trip to America. An edition of Poems by Matthew Arnold with an introduction by A. C. Benson and illustrations by Henry Ospovat was published in 1900 by John Lane. Arnold died suddenly in 1888 of heart failure whilst running to meet a tram that would have taken him to the Liverpool Landing Stage to see his daughter who was visiting from the United States where she had moved after marrying an American. He was survived by his wife who died in June 1901. Arnold is sometimes called the third great Victorian poet along with Alfred Lord Tennyson and Robert Browning. Arnold was keenly aware of his place in poetry. In an 1869 letter to his mother he wrote My poems represent on the whole the main movement of mind of the last quarter of a century and thus they will probably have their day as people become conscious to themselves of what that movement of mind is and interested in the literary productions which reflect it. It might be fairly urged that I have less poetical sentiment than Tennyson and less intellectual vigour and abundance than Browning; yet because I have perhaps more of a fusion of the two than either of them and have more regularly applied that fusion to the main line of modern development I am likely enough to have my turn as they have had theirs. Stefan Collini regards this as an exceptionally frank but not unjust self-assessment. ... Arnolds poetry continues to have scholarly attention lavished upon it in part because it seems to furnish such striking evidence for several central aspects of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century especially the corrosion of Faith by Doubt. No poet presumably would wish to be summoned by later ages merely as an historical witness but the sheer intellectual grasp of Arnolds verse renders it peculiarly liable to this treatment. Harold Bloom echoes Arnolds self-characterization in his introduction to the Modern Critical Views volume on Arnold Arnold got into his poetry what Tennyson and Browning scarcely needed the main march of mind of his time. Of his poetry Bloom says Whatever his achievement as a critic of literature society or religion his work as a poet may not merit the reputation it has continued to hold in the twentieth century. Arnold is at his best a very good but highly derivative poet. ... As with Tennyson Hopkins and Rossetti Arnolds dominant precursor was Keats but this is an unhappy puzzle since Arnold professed not to admire Keats greatly while writing his own elegiac poems in a diction meter imagistic procedure that are embarrassingly close to Keats. Sir Edmund Chambers noted that in a comparison between the best works of Matthew Arnold and that of his six greatest contemporaries ... the proportion of work which endures is greater in the case of Matthew Arnold than in any one of them. Chambers judged Arnolds poetic vision by His literary career leaving out the two prize poems had begun in 1849 with the publication of The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems by A. which attracted little notice and was soon withdrawn. It contained what is perhaps Arnolds most purely poetical poem The Forsaken Merman. Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems published in 1852 had a similar fate. In 1858 he published his tragedy of Merope calculated he wrote to a friend rather to inaugurate my Professorship with dignity than to move deeply the present race of humans and chiefly remarkable for some experiments in unusual and unsuccessful metres. His 1867 poem Dover Beach depicted a nightmarish world from which the old religious verities have receded. It is sometimes held up as an early if not the first example of the modern sensibility. In a famous preface to a selection of the poems of William Wordsworth Arnold identified a little ironically as a Wordsworthian. The influence of Wordsworth both in ideas and in diction is unmistakable in Arnolds best poetry. Dover Beach is included in Ray Bradburys novel Fahrenheit 451 and is featured prominently in the novel Saturday by Ian McEwan. It has been quoted or alluded to in a variety of other contexts . Henry James wrote that Arnolds poetry will appeal to those who like their pleasures rare and who like to hear the poet taking breath. He derived the subject matter of his narrative poems from traditional or literary sources and much of the romantic melancholy of his earlier poems from Senancours Obermann. Assessing the importance of Arnolds prose work in 1988 Stefan Collini stated for reasons to do with our own cultural preoccupations as much as with the merits of his writing the best of his prose has a claim on us today that cannot be matched by his poetry. Certainly there may still be some readers who vaguely recalling Dover Beach or The Scholar Gipsy from school anthologies are surprised to find he also wrote prose. George Watson follows George Saintsbury in dividing Arnolds career as a prose writer into three phases 1 early literary criticism that begins with his preface to the 1853 edition of his poems and ends with the first series of Essays in Criticism ; 2 a prolonged middle period characterised by social political and religious writing ; 3 a return to literary criticism with the selecting and editing of collections of Wordsworths and Byrons poetry and the second series of Essays in Criticism. Both Watson and Saintsbury declare their preference for Arnolds literary criticism over his social or religious criticism. More recent writers such as Collini have shown a greater interest in his social writing while over the years a significant second tier of criticism has focused on Arnolds religious writing. His writing on education has not drawn a significant critical endeavour separable from the criticism of his social writings. Arnolds work as a literary critic began with the 1853 Preface to the Poems. In it he attempted to explain his extreme act of self-censorship in excluding the dramatic poem Empedocles on Etna. With its emphasis on the importance of subject in poetry on clearness of arrangement rigor of development simplicity of style learned from the Greeks and in the strong imprint of Goethe and Wordsworth may be observed nearly all the essential elements in his critical theory. George Watson described the preface written by the thirty-one-year-old Arnold as oddly stiff and graceless when we think of the elegance of his later prose. Criticism began to take first place in Arnolds writing with his appointment in 1857 to the professorship of poetry at Oxford which he held for two successive terms of five years. In 1861 his lectures On Translating Homer were published to be followed in 1862 by Last Words on Translating Homer. Especially characteristic both of his defects and his qualities are on the one hand Arnolds unconvincing advocacy of English hexameters and his creation of a kind of literary absolute in the grand style and on the other his keen feeling of the need for a disinterested and intelligent criticism in England. Although Arnolds poetry received only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime his forays into literary criticism were more successful. Arnold is famous for introducing a methodology of literary criticism somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics at the time and the personal essay; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues. His Essays in Criticism remains a significant influence on critics to this day and his prefatory essay to that collection The Function of Criticism at the Present Time is one of the most influential essays written on the role of the critic in identifying and elevating literature even while saying The critical power is of lower rank than the creative. Comparing himself to the French liberal essayist Ernest Renan who sought to inculcate morality in France Arnold saw his role as inculcating intelligence in England. In one of his most famous essays on the topic The Study of Poetry Arnold wrote that Without poetry our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry. He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were high truth and high seriousness. By this standard Chaucers Canterbury Tales did not merit Arnolds approval. Further Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both high truth and high seriousness such as those of Shakespeare and Milton could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry. He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested and said that the appreciation should be of the object as in itself it really is. He was led on from literary criticism to a more general critique of the spirit of his age. Between 1867 and 1869 he wrote Culture and Anarchy famous for the term he popularised for the middle class of the English Victorian era population Philistines a word which derives its modern cultural meaning from him. Culture and Anarchy is also famous for its popularisation of the phrase sweetness and light first coined by Jonathan Swift. In Culture and Anarchy Arnold identifies himself as a Liberal and a believer in culture and takes up what historian Richard Bellamy calls the broadly Gladstonian effort to transform the Liberal Party into a vehicle of political moralism. Arnold viewed with skepticism the plutocratic grasping in socioeconomic affairs and engaged the questions which vexed many Victorian liberals on the nature of power and the states role in moral guidance. Arnold vigorously attacked the Nonconformists and the arrogance of the great Philistine middle-class the master force in our politics. The Philistines were humdrum people slaves to routine enemies to light who believed that Englands greatness was due to her material wealth alone and took little interest in culture. Liberal education was essential and by that Arnold meant a close reading and attachment to the cultural classics coupled with critical reflection. Arnold saw the experience and reflection of Liberalism as naturally leading to the ethical end of renouncement as evoking the best self to suppress ones ordinary self. Despite his quarrels with the Nonconformists Arnold remained a loyal Liberal throughout his life and in 1883 William Gladstone awarded him an annual pension of 250 pounds as a public recognition of service to the poetry and literature of England. Many subsequent critics such as Edward Alexander Lionel Trilling George Scialabba and Russell Jacoby have emphasised the liberal character of Arnolds thought.Hugh Stuart Jones describes Arnolds work as a liberal critique of Victorian liberalism while Alan S. Kahan places Arnolds critique of middle-class philistinism materialism and mediocrity within the tradition of aristocratic liberalism as exemplified by liberal thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville. Arnolds want of logic and thoroughness of thought as noted by John M. Robertson in Modern Humanists was an aspect of the inconsistency of which Arnold was accused. Few of his ideas were his own and he failed to reconcile the conflicting influences which moved him so strongly. There are four people in especial he once wrote to Cardinal Newman from whom I am conscious of having learnt a very different thing from merely receiving a strong impression learnt habits methods ruling ideas which are constantly with me; and the four are Goethe Wordsworth Sainte-Beuve and yourself. Dr. Arnold must be added; the sons fundamental likeness to the father was early pointed out by Swinburne and was later attested by Matthew Arnolds grandson Mr. Arnold Whitridge. Others such as Stefan Collini suggest that much of the criticism aimed at Arnold is based on a convenient parody of what he is supposed to have stood for rather than the genuine article. In 1887 Arnold was credited with coining the phrase New Journalism a term that went on to define an entire genre of newspaper history particularly Lord Northcliffes turn-of-the-century press empire. However at the time the target of Arnolds irritation was not Northcliffe but the sensational journalism of Pall Mall Gazette editor W. T. Stead.Arnold had enjoyed a long and mutually beneficial association with the Pall Mall Gazette since its inception in 1865. As an occasional contributor he had formed a particular friendship with its first editor Frederick Greenwood and a close acquaintance with its second John Morley. But he strongly disapproved of the muck-raking Stead and declared that under Stead the P.M.G. whatever may be its merits is fast ceasing to be literature. He was appalled at the shamelessness of the sensationalistic new journalism of the sort he witnessed on his tour the United States in 1886. In his account of that tour Civilization in the United States he observed if one were searching for the best means to efface and kill in a whole nation the discipline of self-respect the feeling for what is elevated he could do no better than take the American newspapers. His religious views were unusual for his time and caused sorrow to some of his best friends. Scholars of Arnolds works disagree on the nature of Arnolds personal religious beliefs. Under the influence of Baruch Spinoza and his father Dr. Thomas Arnold he rejected the supernatural elements in religion even while retaining a fascination for church rituals. In the preface to God and the Bible written in 1875 Arnold recounts a powerful sermon he attended discussing the salvation by Jesus Christ he writes Never let us deny to this story power and pathos or treat with hostility ideas which have entered so deep into the life of Christendom. But the story is not true; it never really happened. He continues to express his concern with Biblical truth explaining that The personages of the Christian heaven and their conversations are no more matter of fact than the personages of the Greek Olympus and their conversations. He also wrote in Literature and Dogma The word God is used in most cases as by no means a term of science or exact knowledge but a term of poetry and eloquence a term thrown out so to speak as a not fully grasped object of the speakers consciousness a literary term in short; and mankind mean different things by it as their consciousness differs. He defined religion as morality touched with emotion. However he also wrote in the same book to pass from a Christianity relying on its miracles to a Christianity relying on its natural truth is a great change. It can only be brought about by those whose attachment to Christianity is such that they cannot part with it and yet cannot but deal with it sincerely. Harold Bloom writes that Whatever his achievement as a critic of literature society or religion his work as a poet may not merit the reputation it has continued to hold in the twentieth century. Arnold is at his best a very good but highly derivative poet unlike Tennyson Browning Hopkins Swinburne and Rossetti all of whom individualized their voices. The writer John Cowper Powys an admirer wrote that with the possible exception of Merope Matthew Arnolds poetry is arresting from cover to cover always has the air of an ironic and urbane scholar chatting freely perhaps a little indiscreetly with his not very respectful pupils.

Christina Rossetti,Christina Georgina Rossetti was an English writer of romantic devotional and childrens poems including Goblin Market and Remember. She also wrote the words of two Christmas carols well known in Britain In the Bleak Midwinter later set by Gustav Holst Katherine Kennicott Davis and Harold Darke and Love Came Down at Christmas also set by Darke and other composers. She was a sister of the artist and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti and features in several of his paintings. Christina Rossetti was born in 38 Charlotte Street London to Gabriele Rossetti a poet and a political exile from Vasto Abruzzo Italy since 1824 and Frances Polidori the sister of Lord Byrons friend and physician John William Polidori. She had two brothers and a sister Dante Gabriel became an influential artist and poet and William Michael and Maria both became writers. Christina the youngest and a lively child dictated her first story to her mother before she had learnt to write. Rossetti was educated at home by her mother and father through religious works classics fairy tales and novels. Rossetti delighted in the works of Keats Scott Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis. The influence of the work of Dante Alighieri Petrarch and other Italian writers filled the home and influenced Rossettis later writing. Their household was open to visiting Italian scholars artists and revolutionaries. The family homes in Bloomsbury at no.38 and later no.50 Charlotte Street were within easy reach of Madame Tussauds London Zoo and the newly opened Regents Park which she visited regularly. Unlike her parents Rossetti felt at home in London and was seemingly happy. In the 1840s Rossettis family faced financial troubles due to a deterioration in her fathers physical and mental health. In 1843 he was diagnosed with persistent bronchitis possibly tuberculosis and faced losing his sight. He gave up his teaching post at Kings College and though he lived another 11 years suffered from depression and was never physically well again. Rossettis mother began teaching to support the family and Maria became a live-in governess a prospect that Christina Rossetti dreaded. At the time her brother William was working for the Excise Office and Gabriel was at art school leaving Christina increasingly isolated at home. When she was 14 she suffered a nervous breakdown and left school. Bouts of depression and related illness followed. During this period she her mother and her sister became absorbed in the Anglo-Catholic movement that developed in the Church of England. Religious devotion came to play a major role in her life. In her late teens Rossetti became engaged to the painter James Collinson the first of three suitors. He like her brothers Dante and William was a founding member of the avant-garde Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood established in 1848. The engagement ended in 1850 when he reverted to Catholicism. In 1853 when the family had financial difficulties Christina helped her mother keep a school in Fromefield Frome but it did not succeed. A plaque marks the house. In 1854 the pair returned to London where Christinas father died. She later became involved with the linguist Charles Cayley but declined to marry him also for religious reasons. A third offer came from the painter John Brett whom she likewise refused. Rossetti sat for several of Dante Gabriel Rossettis paintings. In 1848 she sat for the Virgin Mary in his first completed oil painting The Girlhood of Mary Virgin and the first work he inscribed with the initials PRB later revealed as standing for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The following year she modelled for his depiction of the Annunciation Ecce Ancilla Domini. A line from her poem Who shall deliver me inspired a painting by Fernand Khnopff called I lock my door upon myself. In 1849 she again became seriously ill with depression and around 1857 had a major religious crisis. From 1842 onward Rossetti began writing down and dating her poems. Most of them imitated her favoured poets. In 1847 she began experimenting with verse forms such as sonnets hymns and ballads while drawing narratives from the Bible folk tales and the lives of saints. Her early pieces often meditate on death and loss in the Romantic tradition. Her first two poems published were Deaths Chill Between and Hearts Chill Between in the Athenaeum magazine in 1848. She used the pseudonym Ellen Alleyne in the literary periodical The Germ published by the Pre-Raphaelites from January to April 1850 and edited by her brother William. This marked the beginning of her public career. Rossettis more critical reflections on the artistic movement her brother had begun were expressed in an 1856 poem In the Artists Studio. Here she reflects on seeing multiple paintings of the same model. For Rossetti the artists idealised vision of the models character begins to overwhelm his work until every canvas meansthe one same meaning. Dinah Roe in her introduction to the Penguin Classics collection of Pre-Raphaelite poetry argues that this critique of her brother and similar male artists is less about the objectification of women than about the male artists self-worship. Rossettis first commercially printed collection Goblin Market and Other Poems was published under her own name by Macmillan Co. in 1862 when she was 31. Dante Gabriel Rossetti became his sisters collaborator and created stunning woodcut illustrations to the book which enhanced the effect of the work and emphasised its sensuality.Goblin Market was widely praised by critics who placed her as the foremost female poet of the day; sales however were disappointing. She was lauded by Gerard Manley Hopkins Algernon Swinburne and Tennyson. After its publication Rossetti was named the natural successor to Elizabeth Barrett Browning who had died the year before in 1861. The title poem one of her best known is ostensibly about two sisters misadventures with goblins but critics have seen it in various ways including an allegory of temptation and salvation a comment on Victorian gender roles and female agency and a work of erotic desire and social redemption. Rossetti worked voluntarily in 18591870 at the St Mary Magdalene house of charity in Highgate a refuge for ex-prostitutes. It is suggested that Goblin Market may have been inspired by fallen women she came to know. There are parallels with Samuel Taylor Coleridges The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in religious themes of temptation sin and redemption by vicarious suffering.Swinburne in 1883 dedicated A Century of Roundels to Rossetti as she adopted his roundel form in a number of poems for instance in Wife to Husband. She was ambivalent about womens suffrage but many have found feminist themes in her work. She opposed slavery in the United States cruelty to animals in prevalent vivisection and exploitation of girls in under-age prostitution. Rossetti kept a wide circle of friends and correspondents. She continued to write and publish for the rest of her life mainly devotional work and childrens poetry. In the years just before her death she wrote The Face of the Deep a book of devotional prose and oversaw an enlarged edition of Sing-Song originally published in 1872 in 1893. She died late the next year. Rossetti was one of the very first female stamp collectors beginning her collection in 1847 just seven years after the first stamp was issued. SongWhen I am dead my dearestSing no sad songs for me;Plant thou no roses at my headNor shady cypress treeBe the green grass above meWith showers and dewdrops wetAnd if thou wilt rememberAnd if thou wilt forget.I shall not see the shadowsI shall not feel the rain;I shall not hear the nightingaleSing on as if in painAnd dreaming through the twilightThat doth not rise nor setHaply I may rememberAnd haply may forget. In her later decades Rossetti suffered from a type of hyperthyroidism Graves disease diagnosed in 1872 suffering a near-fatal attack in the early 1870s. In 1893 she developed breast cancer. The tumour was removed but there was a recurrence in September 1894. Christina Rossetti died in great pain and anguish of cancer on 29 December 1894 and was buried on 2 January 1895 in the family grave on the west side of Highgate Cemetery which notoriously had been opened in October 1869 so that Gabriel could retrieve a volume of poems he had buried with his wife. There she joined her father mother and Elizabeth Siddal wife of her brother Dante Gabriel. Her brother William was also buried there in 1919 as were the ashes of four subsequent family members. There is a stone tablet on the façade of 30 Torrington Square Bloomsbury marking her final home where she died. Rossettis popularity in her lifetime did not approach that of her contemporary Elizabeth Barrett Browning but her standing remained strong after her death. Her popularity faded in the early 20th century in the wake of Modernism but scholars began to explore Freudian themes in her work such as religious and sexual repression reaching for personal biographical interpretations of her poetry. Academics studying her work in the 1970s saw beyond the lyrical sweetness to her mastery of prosody and versification. Feminists held her as symbol of constrained female genius and a leader among 19th-century poets. Her writings strongly influenced writers such as Ford Madox Ford Virginia Woolf Gerard Manley Hopkins Elizabeth Jennings and Philip Larkin. The critic Basil de Sélincourt called her all but our greatest woman poet... incomparably our greatest craftswoman... probably in the first twelve of the masters of English verse. The year stood at its equinoxAnd bluff the North was blowing.A bleat of lambs came from the flocksGreen hardy things were growing.I met a maid with shining locksWhere milky kine were lowing.She wore a kerchief on her neckHer bare arm showed its dimple.Her apron spread without a speckHer air was frank and simple. From The Milking-Maid poem by Christina Georgina Rossetti Rossettis Christmas poem In the Bleak Midwinter became widely known in the English-speaking world after her death when set as a Christmas carol by Gustav Holst and later by Harold Darke. Her poem Love Came Down at Christmas has also been widely arranged as a carol. British composers receptive to Rossettis verse included Alexander Mackenzie Frederick Cowen Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Hubert Parry Hope Squire and Charles Villiers Stanford. In 1918 John Ireland set eight poems from her Sing-Song A Nursery Rhyme Book to music in his song cycle Mother and Child. The poem Song was an inspiration for Bear McCrearys composition When I Am Dead published in 2015. Two of Rossettis poems Where Sunless Rivers Weep and Weeping Willow were set to music by Barbara Arens in her All Beautiful Splendid Things 12 1 Piano Songs on Poems by Women . Rossettis Love is Like a Rose was set to music by Constance Cochnower Virtue; Love Me I Love You was set to music by Hanna Vollenhoven; and Song of the Dawn was set to music by Elise Fellows White. In 2000 one of many Millennium projects across the country was a poetry stone placed in what had been the grounds of North Hill House in Frome. On one side is an excerpt from her poem What Good Shall My Life Do Me Love lights the sun love through the darkLights the moons evanescent arcSame Love lights up the glow-worms spark. She wrote about her brief stay in Frome which had an abundance of green slopes and gentle declivities no boldness or grandeur but plenty of peaceful beauty. In 2011 Rossetti was a subject of a Radio 4 programme In Our Time. The title of J. K. Rowlings novel The Cuckoos Calling follows a line in Rossettis poem A Dirge. Christina Rossetti is commemorated in the Church of England calendar on 27 April.
Bram Stoker,Abraham Bram Stoker was an Irish author who wrote the 1897 Gothic horror novel Dracula. During his lifetime he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Sir Henry Irving and business manager of the West Ends Lyceum Theatre which Irving owned. In his early years Stoker worked as a theatre critic for an Irish newspaper and wrote stories as well as commentaries. He also enjoyed travelling particularly to Cruden Bay in Scotland where he set two of his novels. During another visit to the English coastal town of Whitby Stoker drew inspiration for writing Dracula. He died on 20 April 1912 due to locomotor ataxia and was cremated in north London. Since his death his magnum opus Dracula has become one of the best-known works in English literature and the novel has been adapted for numerous films short stories and plays. Stoker was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent Clontarf on the northside of Dublin Ireland. The park adjacent to the house is now known as Bram Stoker Park. His parents were Abraham Stoker from Dublin and Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley who was raised in County Sligo. Stoker was the third of seven children the eldest of whom was Sir Thornley Stoker 1st Bt. Abraham and Charlotte were members of the Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf and attended the parish church with their children who were baptised there. Abraham was a senior civil servant. Stoker was bedridden with an unknown illness until he started school at the age of seven when he made a complete recovery. Of this time Stoker wrote I was naturally thoughtful and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years. He was privately educated at Bective House school run by the Reverend . After his recovery he grew up without further serious illnesses even excelling as an athlete at Trinity College Dublin which he attended from 1864 to 1870. He graduated with a BA in 1870 and paid to receive his MA in 1875. Though he later in life recalled graduating with honours in mathematics this appears to have been a mistake. He was named University Athlete participating in multiple sports including playing rugby for Dublin University. He was auditor of the College Historical Society and president of the University Philosophical Society where his first paper was on Sensationalism in Fiction and Society. Stoker became interested in the theatre while a student through his friend Dr. Maunsell. While working for the Irish Civil Service he became the theatre critic for the Dublin Evening Mail which was co-owned by Sheridan Le Fanu an author of Gothic tales. Theatre critics were held in low esteem at the time but Stoker attracted notice by the quality of his reviews. In December 1876 he gave a favourable review of Henry Irvings Hamlet at the Theatre Royal in Dublin. Irving invited Stoker for dinner at the Shelbourne Hotel where he was staying and they became friends. Stoker also wrote stories and Crystal Cup was published by the London Society in 1872 followed by The Chain of Destiny in four parts in The Shamrock. In 1876 while a civil servant in Dublin Stoker wrote the non-fiction book The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland which remained a standard work. Furthermore he possessed an interest in art and was a founder of the Dublin Sketching Club in 1879. In 1878 Stoker married Florence Balcombe daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent. She was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor had been Oscar Wilde. Stoker had known Wilde from his student days having proposed him for membership of the universitys Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florences decision but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship and after Wildes fall visited him on the Continent. The Stokers moved to London where Stoker became acting manager and then business manager of Irvings Lyceum Theatre in the West End a post he held for 27 years. On 31 December 1879 Bram and Florences only child was born a son whom they christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker. The collaboration with Henry Irving was important for Stoker and through him he became involved in Londons high society where he met James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle . Working for Irving the most famous actor of his time and managing one of the most successful theatres in London made Stoker a notable if busy man. He was dedicated to Irving and his memoirs show he idolised him. In London Stoker also met Hall Caine who became one of his closest friends he dedicated Dracula to him. In the course of Irvings tours Stoker travelled the world although he never visited Eastern Europe a setting for his most famous novel. Stoker enjoyed the United States where Irving was popular. With Irving he was invited twice to the White House and knew William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. Stoker set two of his novels in America and used Americans as characters the most notable being Quincey Morris. He also met one of his literary idols Walt Whitman having written to him in 1872 an extraordinary letter that some have interpreted as the expression of a deeply-suppressed homosexuality. Stoker was a regular visitor to Cruden Bay in Scotland between 1892 and 1910. His month-long holidays to the Aberdeenshire coastal village provided a large portion of available time for writing his books. Two novels were set in Cruden Bay The Watters Mou and The Mystery of the Sea . He started writing Dracula there in 1895 while in residence at the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel. The guest book with his signatures from 1894 and 1895 still survives. The nearby Slains Castle is linked with Bram Stoker and plausibly provided the visual palette for the descriptions of Castle Dracula during the writing phase. A distinctive room in Slains Castle the octagonal hall matches the description of the octagonal room in Castle Dracula. Stoker visited the English coastal town of Whitby in 1890 and that visit was said to be part of the inspiration for Dracula. Count Dracula comes ashore at Whitby and in the shape of a black dog runs up the 199 steps to the graveyard of St Marys Church in the shadow of the Whitby Abbey ruins. Stoker began writing novels while working as manager for Irving and secretary and director of Londons Lyceum Theatre beginning with The Snakes Pass in 1890 and Dracula in 1897. During this period he was part of the literary staff of The Daily Telegraph in London and he wrote other fiction including the horror novels The Lady of the Shroud and The Lair of the White Worm . He published his Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving in 1906 after Irvings death which proved successful and managed productions at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Before writing Dracula Stoker met Ármin Vámbéry a Hungarian-Jewish writer and traveller . Dracula likely emerged from Vámbérys dark stories of the Carpathian mountains. However this claim has been challenged by many including Elizabeth Miller a professor who since 1990 has had as her major field of research and writing Dracula and its author sources and influences. She has stated The only comment about the subject matter of the talk was that Vambery spoke loudly against Russian aggression. There had been nothing in their conversations about the tales of the terrible Dracula that are supposed to have inspired Stoker to equate his vampire-protagonist with the long-dead tyrant. At any rate by this time Stokers novel was well underway and he was already using the name Dracula for his vampire. Stoker then spent several years researching Central and East European folklore and mythological stories of vampires. The 1972 book In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally claimed that the Count in Stokers novel was based on Vlad III Dracula. However according to Elizabeth Miller Stoker borrowed only the name and scraps of miscellaneous information about Romanian history; further there are no comments about Vlad III in the authors working notes. Dracula is an epistolary novel written as a collection of realistic but completely fictional diary entries telegrams letters ships logs and newspaper clippings all of which added a level of detailed realism to the story a skill which Stoker had developed as a newspaper writer. At the time of its publication Dracula was considered a straightforward horror novel based on imaginary creations of supernatural life. It gave form to a universal fantasy ... and became a part of popular culture. According to the Encyclopedia of World Biography Stokers stories are today included in the categories of horror fiction romanticized Gothic stories and melodrama. They are classified alongside other works of popular fiction such as Mary Shelleys Frankenstein which also used the myth-making and story-telling method of having multiple narrators telling the same tale from different perspectives. According to historian Jules Zanger this leads the reader to the assumption that they cant all be lying. The original 541-page typescript of Dracula was believed to have been lost until it was found in a barn in northwestern Pennsylvania in the early 1980s. It consisted of typed sheets with many emendations and handwritten on the title page was THE UN-DEAD. The authors name was shown at the bottom as Bram Stoker. Author Robert Latham remarked the most famous horror novel ever published its title changed at the last minute. The typescript was purchased by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Stokers inspirations for the story in addition to Whitby may have included a visit to Slains Castle in Aberdeenshire a visit to the crypts of St. Michans Church in Dublin and the novella Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu. Stokers original research notes for the novel are kept by the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. A facsimile edition of the notes was created by Elizabeth Miller and Robert Eighteen-Bisang in 1998. Stoker was a member of The London Library and conducted much of the research for Dracula there. In 2018 the Library discovered some of the books that Stoker used for his research complete with notes and marginalia. After suffering a number of strokes Stoker died at No. 26 St Georges Square London on 20 April 1912. Some biographers attribute the cause of death to overwork others to tertiary syphilis. His death certificate listed the cause of death as Locomotor ataxia 6 months presumed to be a reference to syphilis. He was cremated and his ashes were placed in a display urn at Golders Green Crematorium in north London. The ashes of Irving Noel Stoker the authors son were added to his fathers urn following his death in 1961. The original plan had been to keep his parents ashes together but after Florence Stokers death her ashes were scattered at the Gardens of Rest. Stoker was raised a Protestant in the Church of Ireland. He was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party and took a keen interest in Irish affairs. As a philosophical home ruler he supported Home Rule for Ireland brought about by peaceful means. He remained an ardent monarchist who believed that Ireland should remain within the British Empire an entity that he saw as a force for good. He was an admirer of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone whom he knew personally and supported his plans for Ireland. Stoker believed in progress and took a keen interest in science and science-based medicine. Some of Stokers novels represent early examples of science fiction such as The Lady of the Shroud . He had a writers interest in the occult notably mesmerism but despised fraud and believed in the superiority of the scientific method over superstition. Stoker counted among his friends J. W. Brodie-Innis a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and hired member Pamela Colman Smith as an artist for the Lyceum Theatre but no evidence suggests that Stoker ever joined the Order himself. Although Irving was an active Freemason no evidence has been found of Stoker taking part in Masonic activities in London. The Grand Lodge of Ireland also has no record of his membership. The short story collection Draculas Guest and Other Weird Stories was published in 1914 by Stokers widow Florence Stoker who was also his literary executrix. The first film adaptation of Dracula was F. W. Murnaus Nosferatu released in 1922 with Max Schreck starring as Count Orlok. Florence Stoker eventually sued the filmmakers and was represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors. Her chief legal complaint was that she had neither been asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years with Mrs. Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the film. The suit was finally resolved in the widows favour in July 1925. A single print of the film survived however and it has become well known. The first authorised film version of Dracula did not come about until almost a decade later when Universal Studios released Tod Brownings Dracula starring Bela Lugosi. Canadian writer Dacre Stoker a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker decided to write a sequel that bore the Stoker name to reestablish creative control over the original novel with encouragement from screenwriter Ian Holt because of the Stokers frustrating history with Draculas copyright. In 2009 Dracula The Un-Dead was released written by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt. Both writers based on Bram Stokers own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition along with their own research for the sequel. This also marked Dacre Stokers writing debut. In spring 2012 Dacre Stoker presented the lost Dublin Journal written by Bram Stoker which had been kept by his great-grandson Noel Dobbs. Stokers diary entries shed a light on the issues that concerned him before his London years. A remark about a boy who caught flies in a bottle might be a clue for the later development of the Renfield character in Dracula. On 8 November 2012 Stoker was honoured with a Google Doodle on Googles homepage commemorating the 165th anniversary of his birth. An annual festival takes place in Dublin the birthplace of Bram Stoker in honour of his literary achievements. The 2014 Bram Stoker Festival encompassed literary film family street and outdoor events and ran from October 24 to 27 in Dublin. The festival is supported by the Bram Stoker Estate and funded by Dublin City Council and Fáilte Ireland.
Oscar Wilde,Oscar Fingal OFflahertie Wills Wilde was an Irish poet and playwright. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s he became one of the most popular playwrights in London in the early 1890s. He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for gross indecency for consensual homosexual acts in one of the first celebrity trials imprisonment and early death from meningitis at the age of 46. Wildes parents were Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. In his youth Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German. At university he read Greats; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist first at Trinity College Dublin then at Magdalen College Oxford. He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism led by two of his tutors Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. As a spokesman for aestheticism he tried his hand at various literary activities he published a book of poems lectured in the United States and Canada on the new English Renaissance in Art and interior decoration and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays and incorporated themes of decadence duplicity and beauty into what would be his only novel The Picture of Dorian Gray . The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely and combine them with larger social themes drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote Salome in French while in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Undiscouraged Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London. At the height of his fame and success while The Importance of Being Earnest was still being performed in London Wilde prosecuted the Marquess of Queensberry for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wildes lover Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years hard labour the maximum penalty and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison he wrote De Profundis a long letter that discusses his spiritual journey through his trials forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. On his release he left immediately for France and never returned to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work The Ballad of Reading Gaol a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. Oscar Wilde was born at 21 Westland Row Dublin the second of three children born to an Anglo-Irish couple Jane née Elgee and Sir William Wilde. Oscar was two years younger than his brother William Wilde. Jane Wilde was a niece of the novelist playwright and clergyman Charles Maturin who may have influenced her own literary career. She believed mistakenly that she was of Italian ancestry and under the pseudonym Speranza she wrote poetry for the revolutionary Young Irelanders in 1848; she was a lifelong Irish nationalist. Jane Wilde read the Young Irelanders poetry to Oscar and Willie inculcating a love of these poets in her sons. Her interest in the neo-classical revival showed in the paintings and busts of ancient Greece and Rome in her home. Sir William Wilde was Irelands leading oto-ophthalmologic surgeon and was knighted in 1864 for his services as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland. He also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. A renowned philanthropist his dispensary for the care of the citys poor at the rear of Trinity College Dublin was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital now located at Adelaide Road. On his fathers side Wilde was descended from a Dutchman Colonel de Wilde who went to Ireland with King William of Oranges invading army in 1690 and numerous Anglo-Irish ancestors. On his mothers side Wildes ancestors included a bricklayer from County Durham who emigrated to Ireland sometime in the 1770s. Wilde was baptised as an infant in St. Marks Church Dublin the local Church of Ireland church. When the church was closed the records were moved to the nearby St. Anns Church Dawson Street. Davis Coakley mentions a second baptism by a Catholic priest Father Prideaux Fox who befriended Oscars mother c. 1859. According to Foxs testimony in Donahoes Magazine in 1905 Jane Wilde would visit his chapel in Glencree County Wicklow for Mass and would take her sons with her. She asked Father Fox in this period to baptise her sons. I am not sure if she ever became a Catholic herself but it was not long before she asked me to instruct two of her children one of them being the future erratic genius Oscar Wilde. After a few weeks I baptized these two children Lady Wilde herself being present on the occasion. In addition to his two full siblings Oscar Wilde had three half-siblings who were born out of wedlock before the marriage of his father Henry Wilson born in 1838 to one woman and Emily and Mary Wilde born in 1847 and 1849 respectively to a second woman. Sir William acknowledged paternity of his illegitimate or natural children and provided for their education arranging for them to be reared by his relatives rather than with his legitimate children in his family household with his wife. The family moved to No. 1 Merrion Square in 1855; there Wildes sister Isola Francesca Emily Wilde was born on 2 April 1857. She was named in tribute to Iseult of Ireland wife of Mark of Cornwall and lover of the Cornish knight Sir Tristan. She shared the name Francesca with her mother while Emily was the name of her maternal aunt. Oscar was very close to her and grief struck when she died at the age of nine of a febrile illness. Isola lit up their lives like a golden ray of sunshine dancing about our home. The Wildes new home was larger. With both his parents success and delight in social life the house soon became the site of a unique medical and cultural milieu. Guests at their salon included Sheridan Le Fanu Charles Lever George Petrie Isaac Butt William Rowan Hamilton and Samuel Ferguson. Until he was nine Wilde was educated at home where a French nursemaid and a German governess taught him their languages. He joined his brother Willie at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen County Fermanagh which he attended from 1864 to 1871. At Portora although he was not as popular as his older brother Wilde impressed his peers with the humorous and inventive school stories he told. Later in life he claimed that his fellow students had regarded him as a prodigy for his ability to speed read claiming that he could read two facing pages simultaneously and consume a three-volume book in half an hour retaining enough information to give a basic account of the plot. He excelled academically particularly in the subject of Classics in which he ranked fourth in the school in 1869. His aptitude for giving oral translations of Greek and Latin texts won him multiple prizes including the Carpenter Prize for Greek Testament. He was one of only three students at Portora to win a Royal School scholarship to Trinity in 1871. Until his early twenties Wilde summered at the villa Moytura House which his father had built in Cong County Mayo. There the young Wilde and his brother Willie played with George Moore. Isola died at the age of nine of meningitis. Wildes poem Requiescat is written to her memory; the first stanza reads Wilde left Portora with a royal scholarship to read classics at Trinity College Dublin from 1871 to 1874 sharing rooms with his older brother Willie Wilde. Trinity one of the leading classical schools placed him with scholars such as R. Y. Tyrell Arthur Palmer Edward Dowden and his tutor Professor J. P. Mahaffy who inspired his interest in Greek literature. As a student Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latters book Social Life in Greece. Wilde despite later reservations called Mahaffy my first and best teacher and the scholar who showed me how to love Greek things. For his part Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later he said Wilde was the only blot on my tutorship. The University Philosophical Society also provided an education as members discussed intellectual and artistic subjects such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne weekly. Wilde quickly became an established member the members suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter mocking Wildes emergent aestheticism. He presented a paper titled Aesthetic Morality. At Trinity Wilde established himself as an outstanding student he came first in his class in his first year won a scholarship by competitive examination in his second and in his finals won the Berkeley Gold Medal in Greek the Universitys highest academic award. He was encouraged to compete for a demyship per year to Magdalen College Oxford which he won easily. At Magdalen he read Greats from 1874 to 1878 and from there he applied to join the Oxford Union but failed to be elected. Attracted by its dress secrecy and ritual Wilde petitioned the Apollo Masonic Lodge at Oxford and was soon raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. During a resurgent interest in Freemasonry in his third year he commented he would be awfully sorry to give it up if I secede from the Protestant Heresy. Wildes active involvement in Freemasonry lasted only for the time he spent at Oxford; he allowed his membership of the Apollo University Lodge to lapse after failing to pay subscriptions. Catholicism deeply appealed to him especially its rich liturgy and he discussed converting to it with clergy several times. In 1877 Wilde was left speechless after an audience with Pope PiusIX in Rome. He eagerly read the books of Cardinal Newman a noted Anglican priest who had converted to Catholicism and risen in the church hierarchy. He became more serious in 1878 when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden a priest in the Brompton Oratory who had received some high-profile converts. Neither his father who threatened to cut off his funds nor Mahaffy thought much of the plan; but Wilde the supreme individualist balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed and on the appointed day of his baptism into Catholicism sent Father Bowden a bunch of altar lilies instead. Wilde did retain a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy. While at Magdalen College Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. He wore his hair long openly scorned manly sports though he occasionally boxed and he decorated his rooms with peacock feathers lilies sunflowers blue china and other objets dart. He once remarked to friends whom he entertained lavishly I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china. The line quickly became famous accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness. Some elements disdained the aesthetes but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose. Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students and dealt with them single-handedly surprising critics. By his third year Wilde had truly begun to develop himself and his myth and considered his learning to be more expansive than what was within the prescribed texts. This attitude resulted in his being rusticated for one term after he had returned late to a college term from a trip to Greece with Mahaffy. Wilde did not meet Walter Pater until his third year but had been enthralled by his Studies in the History of the Renaissance published during Wildes final year in Trinity. Pater argued that mans sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later in De Profundis Wilde described Paters Studies... as that book that has had such a strange influence over my life. He learned tracts of the book by heart and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art though he gained a purpose for it through the lectures and writings of critic John Ruskin. Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater arguing that the importance of art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty but believed it must be allied with and applied to moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskins lecture series The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence he learned about aesthetics as the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour Wilde volunteered for Ruskins project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers. Wilde won the 1878 Newdigate Prize for his poem Ravenna which reflected on his visit there in the previous year and he duly read it at Encaenia. In November 1878 he graduated with a double first in his B.A. of Classical Moderations and Literae Humaniores . Wilde wrote to a friend The dons are astonied beyond words the Bad Boy doing so well in the end After graduation from Oxford Wilde returned to Dublin where he met again Florence Balcombe a childhood sweetheart. She became engaged to Bram Stoker and they married in 1878. Wilde was disappointed but stoic he wrote to her remembering the two sweet years the sweetest years of all my youth during which they had been close. He also stated his intention to return to England probably for good. This he did in 1878 only briefly visiting Ireland twice after that. Unsure of his next step Wilde wrote to various acquaintances enquiring about Classics positions at Oxford or Cambridge.The Rise of Historical Criticism was his submission for the Chancellors Essay prize of 1879 which though no longer a student he was still eligible to enter. Its subject Historical Criticism among the Ancients seemed ready-made for Wilde with both his skill in composition and ancient learning but he struggled to find his voice with the long flat scholarly style. Unusually no prize was awarded that year. With the last of his inheritance from the sale of his fathers houses he set himself up as a bachelor in London. The 1881 British Census listed Wilde as a boarder at 1 Tite Street Chelsea where Frank Miles a society painter was the head of the household. Celebrated in Londons high society Lillie Langtry was introduced to Wilde at Frank Miles studio in 1877. The most glamorous woman in England Langtry assumed great importance to Wilde during his early years in London and they remained close friends for many years; he tutored her in Latin and later encouraged her to pursue acting. She wrote in her autobiography that he possessed a remarkably fascinating and compelling personality and the cleverness of his remarks received added value from his manner of delivering them. He had been publishing lyrics and poems in magazines since entering Trinity College especially in Kottabos and the Dublin University Magazine. In mid-1881 at 27 years old he published Poems which collected revised and expanded his poems. Though the book sold out its first print run of 750 copies it was not generally well received by the critics Punch for example said that The poet is Wilde but his poetrys tame. By a tight vote the Oxford Union condemned the book for alleged plagiarism. The librarian who had requested the book for the library returned the presentation copy to Wilde with a note of apology. Biographer Richard Ellmann argues that Wildes poem Hélas was a sincere though flamboyant attempt to explain the dichotomies the poet saw in himself; one line reads To drift with every passion till my soul Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play. The book had further printings in 1882. It was bound in a rich enamel parchment cover and printed on hand-made Dutch paper; over the next few years Wilde presented many copies to the dignitaries and writers who received him during his lecture tours. Aestheticism was sufficiently in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience . Richard DOyly Carte an English impresario invited Wilde to make a lecture tour of North America simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona arriving 2 January 1882 and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months the tour continued for almost a year owing to its commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies and now one of his lectures was on interior design. In a British Library article on aestheticism and decadence Carolyn Burdett writes Wilde teased his readers with the claim that life imitates art rather than the other way round. His point was a serious one we notice London fogs he argued because art and literature has taught us to do so. Wilde among others performed these maxims. He presented himself as the impeccably dressed and mannered dandy figure whose life was a work of art. When asked to explain reports that he had paraded down Piccadilly in London carrying a lily long hair flowing Wilde replied Its not whether I did it or not thats important but whether people believed I did it. Wilde believed that the artist should hold forth higher ideals and that pleasure and beauty would replace utilitarian ethics. Wilde and aestheticism were both mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press the Springfield Republican for instance commented on Wildes behaviour during his visit to Boston to lecture on aestheticism suggesting that Wildes conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. T. W. Higginson a cleric and abolitionist wrote in Unmanly Manhood of his general concern that Wilde whose only distinction is that he has written a thin volume of very mediocre verse would improperly influence the behaviour of men and women. According to biographer Michèle Mendelssohn Wilde was the subject of anti-Irish caricature and was portrayed as a monkey a blackface performer and a Christys Minstrel throughout his career. Harpers Weekly put a sunflower-worshipping monkey dressed as Wilde on the front of the January 1882 issue. The drawing stimulated other American maligners and in England had a full-page reprint in the Ladys Pictorial. ... When the National Republican discussed Wilde it was to explain a few items as to the animals pedigree. And on 22 January 1882 the Washington Post illustrated the Wild Man of Borneo alongside Oscar Wilde of England and asked How far is it from this to this Though his press reception was hostile Wilde was well received in diverse settings across America he drank whiskey with miners in Leadville Colorado and was fêted at the most fashionable salons in many cities he visited. His earnings plus expected income from The Duchess of Padua allowed him to move to Paris between February and mid-May 1883. While there he met Robert Sherard whom he entertained constantly. We are dining on the Duchess tonight Wilde would declare before taking him to an expensive restaurant. In August he briefly returned to New York for the production of Vera his first play after it was turned down in London. He reportedly entertained the other passengers with Ave Imperatrix A Poem on England about the rise and fall of empires. E. C. Stedman in Victorian Poets describes this lyric to England as manly verse a poetic and eloquent invocation. In London he had been introduced in 1881 to Constance Lloyd daughter of Horace Lloyd a wealthy Queens Counsel. She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884 when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St Jamess Church Paddington in London. Although Constance had an annual allowance of 250 which was generous for a young woman the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes. They had preached to others for so long on the subject of design that people expected their home to set new standards. No. 16 Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons together Cyril and Vyvyan . Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaws petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886. Wilde had a number of favourite haunts in London. These included the Café Royal in Piccadilly Hatchards bookstore in Piccadilly and the department stores Liberty Co. on Great Marlborough Street and Harrods in Knightsbridge; Wilde was among Harrods first selected customers who were granted extended credit. Criticism over artistic matters in The Pall Mall Gazette provoked a letter in self-defence and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 188587. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art literature and life yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde like his parents before him also supported the cause of Irish nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle. His flair having previously been put mainly into socialising suited journalism and rapidly attracted notice. With his youth nearly over and a family to support in mid-1887 Wilde became the editor of The Ladys World magazine his name prominently appearing on the cover. He promptly renamed it as The Womans World and raised its tone adding serious articles on parenting culture and politics while keeping discussions of fashion and arts. Two pieces of fiction were usually included one to be read to children the other for the ladies themselves. Wilde worked hard to solicit good contributions from his wide artistic acquaintance including those of Lady Wilde and his wife Constance while his own Literary and Other Notes were themselves popular and amusing. The initial vigour and excitement which he brought to the job began to fade as administration commuting and office life became tedious. At the same time as Wildes interest flagged the publishers became concerned anew about circulation sales at the relatively high price of one shilling remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter Wilde began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889 Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and at the end of the second volume Wilde left The Womans World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue. If Wildes period at the helm of the magazine was a mixed success from an organizational point of view it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors Wilde the editor was forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms. During the late 1880s Wilde was a close friend of the artist James McNeill Whistler and they dined together on many occasions. At one of these dinners Whistler said a bon mot that Wilde found particularly witty Wilde exclaimed that he wished that he had said it and Whistler retorted You will Oscar you will.Herbert Viviana mutual friend of Wilde and Whistlerattended the dinner and recorded it in his article The Reminiscences of a Short Life which appeared in The Sun in 1889. The article alleged that Wilde had a habit of passing off other peoples witticisms as his ownespecially Whistlers. Wilde considered Vivians article to be a scurrilous betrayal and it directly caused the broken friendship between Wilde and Whistler. The Reminiscences also caused great acrimony between Wilde and Vivian Wilde accusing Vivian of the inaccuracy of an eavesdropper with the method of a blackmailer and banishing Vivian from his circle. Vivians allegations did not diminish Wildes reputation as an epigrammatist. London theatre director Luther Munday recounted some of Wildes typical quips He said of Whistler that he had no enemies but was intensely disliked by his friends. Of Hall Caine that he wrote at the top of his voice. Of Rudyard Kipling that he revealed life by splendid flashes of vulgarity. Of Henry James that he wrote fiction as if it were a painful duty and of Marion Crawford that he immolated himself on the altar of local colour. Wilde published The Happy Prince and Other Tales in 1888 and had been regularly writing fairy stories for magazines. In 1891 he published two more collections Lord Arthur Saviles Crime and Other Stories and in September A House of Pomegranates was dedicated To Constance Mary Wilde. The Portrait of Mr. W. H. which Wilde had begun in 1887 was first published in Blackwoods Edinburgh Magazine in July 1889. It is a short story which reports a conversation in which the theory that Shakespeares sonnets were written out of the poets love of the boy actor Willie Hughes is advanced retracted and then propounded again. The only evidence for this is two supposed puns within the sonnets themselves. The anonymous narrator is at first sceptical then believing finally flirtatious with the reader he concludes that there is really a great deal to be said of the Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeares sonnets. By the end fact and fiction have melded together.Arthur Ransome wrote that Wilde read something of himself into Shakespeares sonnets and became fascinated with the Willie Hughes theory despite the lack of biographical evidence for the historical William Hughes existence. Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question Wilde tossed the theory amongst the three characters of the story allowing it to unfold as background to the plot. The story thus is an early masterpiece of Wildes combining many elements that interested him conversation literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth. Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch. Though containing nothing but special pleading it would not he says be possible to build an airier castle in Spain than this of the imaginary William Hughes we continue listening nonetheless to be charmed by the telling. You must believe in Willie Hughes Wilde told an acquaintance I almost do myself. Wilde having tired of journalism had been busy setting out his aesthetic ideas more fully in a series of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889 The Decay of Lying A Dialogue appeared in The Nineteenth Century and Pen Pencil and Poison a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright in The Fortnightly Review edited by Wildes friend Frank Harris. Two of Wildes four writings on aesthetics are dialogues though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur he often composed by assembling phrases bons mots and witticisms into a longer cohesive work. Wilde was concerned about the effect of moralising on art; he believed in arts redemptive developmental powers Art is individualism and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type slavery of custom tyranny of habit and the reduction of man to the level of a machine. In his only political text The Soul of Man Under Socialism he argued political conditions should establish this primacy private property should be abolished and cooperation should be substituted for competition. He wrote Socialism Communism or whatever one chooses to call it by converting private property into public wealth and substituting co-operation for competition will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism and insure the material well-being of each member of the community. It will in fact give Life its proper basis and its proper environment. At the same time he stressed that the government most amenable to artists was no government at all. Wilde envisioned a society where mechanisation has freed human effort from the burden of necessity effort which can instead be expended on artistic creation. George Orwell summarised In effect the world will be populated by artists each striving after perfection in the way that seems best to him. This point of view did not align him with the Fabians intellectual socialists who advocated using state apparatus to change social conditions nor did it endear him to the monied classes whom he had previously entertained.Hesketh Pearson introducing a collection of Wildes essays in 1950 remarked how The Soul of Man Under Socialism had been an inspirational text for revolutionaries in Tsarist Russia but laments that in the Stalinist era it is doubtful whether there are any uninspected places in which it could now be hidden. Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask and he will tell you the truth. Wilde considered including this pamphlet and The Portrait of Mr. W. H. his essay-story on Shakespeares sonnets in a new anthology in 1891 but eventually decided to limit it to purely aesthetic subjects. Intentions packaged revisions of four essays The Decay of Lying; Pen Pencil and Poison; The Truth of Masks ; and The Critic as Artist in two parts. For Pearson the biographer the essays and dialogues exhibit every aspect of Wildes genius and character wit romancer talker lecturer humanist and scholar and concludes that no other productions of his have as varied an appeal. 1891 turned out to be Wildes annus mirabilis; apart from his three collections he also produced his only novel. The first version of The Picture of Dorian Gray was published as the lead story in the July 1890 edition of Lippincotts Monthly Magazine along with five others. The story begins with a man painting a picture of Gray. When Gray who has a face like ivory and rose leaves sees his finished portrait he breaks down. Distraught that his beauty will fade while the portrait stays beautiful he inadvertently makes a Faustian bargain in which only the painted image grows old while he stays beautiful and young. For Wilde the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were its object. As Grays portrait allows him to escape the corporeal ravages of his hedonism Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty he saw in art with daily life. Reviewers immediately criticised the novels decadence and homosexual allusions; The Daily Chronicle for example called it unclean poisonous and heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction. Wilde vigorously responded writing to the editor of the Scots Observer in which he clarified his stance on ethics and aesthetics in art If a work of art is rich and vital and complete those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see its moral lesson. He nevertheless revised it extensively for book publication in 1891 six new chapters were added some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised and a preface was included consisting of twenty-two epigrams such as Books are well written or badly written. That is all. Contemporary reviewers and modern critics have postulated numerous possible sources of the story a search Jershua McCormack argues is futile because Wilde has tapped a root of Western folklore so deep and ubiquitous that the story has escaped its origins and returned to the oral tradition. Wilde claimed the plot was an idea that is as old as the history of literature but to which I have given a new form. Modern critic Robin McKie considered the novel to be technically mediocre saying that the conceit of the plot had guaranteed its fame but the device is never pushed to its full. On the other hand Robert McCrum of The Guardian lists it among the 100 best novels ever written in English calling it an arresting and slightly camp exercise in late-Victorian gothic. The novel has been the subject of many adaptations to film and stage and one of its most quoted lines there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about features in Monty Pythons Oscar Wilde sketch in an episode of Monty Pythons Flying Circus. The 1891 census records the Wildes residence at 16 Tite Street where Oscar lived with his wife Constance and two sons. Not content with being better known than ever in London though he returned to Paris in October 1891 this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wildes two plays during the 1880s Vera; or The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now after finding his voice in prose his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play Salomé written rapidly and in French. A tragedy it tells the story of Salome the stepdaughter of the tetrarch Herod Antipas who to her stepfathers dismay but mothers delight requests the head of Jokanaan on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the Dance of the Seven Veils. When Wilde returned to London just before Christmas the Paris Echo referred to him as le great event of the season. Rehearsals of the play starring Sarah Bernhardt began but the play was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain since it depicted biblical characters.Salome was published jointly in Paris and London in 1893 but was not performed until 1896 in Paris during Wildes later incarceration. Wilde who had first set out to irritate Victorian society with his dress and talking points then to outrage it with Dorian Gray his novel of vice hidden beneath art finally found a way to critique society on its own terms. Lady Windermeres Fan was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St Jamess Theatre packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy there is subtle subversion underneath it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure. The audience like Lady Windermere are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. The play was enormously popular touring the country for months but largely trashed by conservative critics. The success of the play saw Wilde earn 7000 in the first year alone . His first hit play was followed by A Woman of No Importance in 1893 another Victorian comedy revolving around the spectre of illegitimate births mistaken identities and late revelations. Wilde was commissioned to write two more plays and An Ideal Husband written in 1894 followed in January 1895. Peter Raby said these essentially English plays were well-pitched Wilde with one eye on the dramatic genius of Ibsen and the other on the commercial competition in Londons West End targeted his audience with adroit precision. In mid-1891 Lionel Johnson introduced Wilde to Lord Alfred Douglas Johnsons cousin who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford. Known to his family and friends as Bosie he was a handsome and spoilt young man. An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas and by 1893 Wilde was infatuated with Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair. If Wilde was relatively indiscreet even flamboyant in the way he acted Douglas was reckless in public. Wilde who was earning up to 100 a week from his plays indulged Douglass every whim material artistic or sexual. Douglas soon initiated Wilde into the Victorian underground of gay prostitution and Wilde was introduced to a series of young working-class male prostitutes from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form Wilde would meet the boy offer him gifts dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room. Unlike Wildes idealised relations with Ross John Gray and Douglas all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in De Profundis he wrote to Douglas that It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement... I did not know that when they were to strike at me it was to be at anothers piping and at anothers pay. Douglas and some Oxford friends founded a journal The Chameleon to which Wilde sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the Saturday Review. Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young was to come under attack six months later at Wildes trial where he was forced to defend the magazine to which he had sent his work. In any case it became unique The Chameleon was not published again. Lord Alfreds father the Marquess of Queensberry was known for his outspoken atheism brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing. Queensberry who feuded regularly with his son confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred about the nature of their relationship several times but Wilde was able to mollify him. In June 1894 he called on Wilde at 16 Tite Street without an appointment and clarified his stance I do not say that you are it but you look it and pose at it which is just as bad. And if I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you to which Wilde responded I dont know what the Queensberry rules are but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight. His account in De Profundis was less triumphant It was when in my library at Tite Street waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out. Queensberry only described the scene once saying Wilde had shown him the white feather meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberrys insults but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly. Wildes final play again returns to the theme of switched identities the plays two protagonists engage in bunburying which allows them to escape Victorian social mores.Earnest is even lighter in tone than Wildes earlier comedies. While their characters often rise to serious themes in moments of crisis Earnest lacks the by-now-stock Wildean characters there is no woman with a past the principals are neither villainous nor cunning simply idle cultivés and the idealistic young women are not that innocent. Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence Earnest lacks the self-conscious decadence found in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Salome. The play now considered Wildes masterpiece was rapidly written in Wildes artistic maturity in late 1894. It was first performed on 14 February 1895 at St Jamess Theatre in London Wildes second collaboration with George Alexander the actor-manager. Both author and producer assiduously revised prepared and rehearsed every line scene and setting in the months before the premiere creating a carefully constructed representation of late-Victorian society yet simultaneously mocking it. During rehearsal Alexander requested that Wilde shorten the play from four acts to three which the author did. Premieres at St Jamess seemed like brilliant parties and the opening of The Importance of Being Earnest was no exception. Allan Aynesworth recalled to Hesketh Pearson In my fifty-three years of acting I never remember a greater triumph than first night.Earnests immediate reception as Wildes best work to date finally crystallised his fame into a solid artistic reputation. In a review of the play for The Pall Mall Gazette H. G. Wells wrote More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine. Mr Oscar Wilde has decorated a humour that is Gilbertian with innumerable spangles of that wit that is all his own.The Importance of Being Earnest remains his most popular play. Wildes professional success was mirrored by an escalation in his feud with Queensberry. Queensberry had planned to insult Wilde publicly by throwing a bouquet of rotting vegetables onto the stage; Wilde was tipped off and had Queensberry barred from entering the theatre. Fifteen weeks later Wilde was in prison. On 18 February 1895 the Marquess of Queensberry left his calling card at Wildes club the Albemarle inscribed For Oscar Wilde posing somdomite . Wilde encouraged by Douglas and against the advice of his friends initiated a private prosecution against Queensberry for libel since the note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy. Queensberry was arrested for criminal libel a charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison. Under the 1843 Libel Act Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true and furthermore that there was some public benefit to having made the accusation openly. Queensberrys lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Wildes homosexual liaisons. Wildes friends had advised him against the prosecution at a Saturday Review meeting at the Café Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that they are going to prove sodomy against you and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff Wilde saying it is at such moments as these that one sees who are ones true friends. The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome a day or so before Ransomes trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde that Douglass rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wildes public disaster as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets. The libel trial became a cause célèbre as salacious details of Wildes private life with Taylor and Douglas began to appear in the press. A team of private detectives had directed Queensberrys lawyers led by Edward Carson QC to the world of the Victorian underground. Wildes association with blackmailers and male prostitutes cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded and various persons involved were interviewed some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to the crimes of which Wilde was accused. The trial opened at the Old Bailey on 3 April 1895 before Justice Richard Henn Collins a fellow Dubliner amid scenes of near hysteria both in the press and the public galleries. The extent of the evidence massed against Wilde forced him to declare meekly I am the prosecutor in this case. Wildes lawyer Sir Edward Clarke opened the case by pre-emptively asking Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas which the defence had in its possession. He characterised the first as a prose sonnet and admitted that the poetical language might seem strange to the court but claimed its intent was innocent. Wilde stated that the letters had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him but he had refused suggesting they should take the 60 offered unusual for a prose piece of that length. He claimed to regard the letters as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed. Carson who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College Dublin at the same time as Wilde cross-examined Wilde on how he perceived the moral content of his works. Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made and that only brutes and illiterates whose views on art are incalculably stupid would make such judgements about art. Carson a leading barrister diverged from the normal practice of asking closed questions. Carson pressed Wilde on each topic from every angle squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wildes answers removing them from their aesthetic context and portraying Wilde as evasive and decadent. While Wilde won the most laughs from the court Carson scored the most legal points. To undermine Wildes credibility and to justify Queensberrys description of Wilde as a posing somdomite Carson drew from the witness an admission of his capacity for posing by demonstrating that he had lied about his age under oath. Playing on this he returned to the topic throughout his cross-examination. Carson also tried to justify Queensberrys characterisation by quoting from Wildes novel The Picture of Dorian Gray referring in particular to a scene in the second chapter in which Lord Henry Wotton explains his decadent philosophy to Dorian an innocent young man in Carsons words. Carson then moved to the factual evidence and questioned Wilde about his friendships with younger lower-class men. Wilde admitted being on a first-name basis and lavishing gifts upon them but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy Wilde responded Oh dear no. He was a particularly plain boy unfortunately ugly I pitied him for it. Carson pressed him on the answer repeatedly asking why the boys ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated then for the first time became flustered You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously. In his opening speech for the defence Carson announced that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. On the advice of his lawyers Wilde dropped the prosecution. Queensberry was found not guilty as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was posing as a Somdomite was justified true in substance and in fact. Under the Libel Act 1843 Queensberrys acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence which left Wilde bankrupt. After Wilde left the court a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan HotelPont Street Knightsbridge with Reginald Turner. Both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover and try to get a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde lapsing into inaction could only say The train has gone. Its too late. On 6 April 1895 Wilde was arrested for gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 a term meaning homosexual acts not amounting to buggery . At Wildes instruction Ross and Wildes butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street packing some personal effects manuscripts and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway where he received daily visits from Douglas. Events moved quickly and his prosecution opened on 26 April 1895 before Mr Justice Charles. Wilde pleaded not guilty. He had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris but Douglas complained bitterly even wanting to give evidence; he was pressed to go and soon fled to the Hotel du Monde. Fearing persecution Ross and many others also left the United Kingdom during this time. Under cross-examination Wilde was at first hesitant then spoke eloquently Charles Gill What is the love that dare not speak its name Wilde The love that dare not speak its name in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo and those two letters of mine such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood so much misunderstood that it may be described as the love that dare not speak its name and on that account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful it is fine it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man when the older man has intellect and the younger man has all the joy hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so the world does not understand. The world mocks at it and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it. This response was counter-productive in a legal sense for it only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour. The trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. Wildes counsel Sir Edward Clarke was finally able to get a magistrate to allow Wilde and his friends to post bail. The Reverend Stewart Headlam put up most of the 5000 surety required by the court having disagreed with Wildes treatment by the press and the courts. Wilde was freed from Holloway and shunning attention went into hiding at the house of Ernest and Ada Leverson two of his firm friends. Edward Carson approached Sir Frank Lockwood QC the Solicitor General and asked Can we not let up on the fellow now Lockwood answered that he would like to do so but feared that the case had become too politicised to be dropped. The final trial was presided over by Mr Justice Wills. On 25 May 1895 Wilde and Alfred Taylor were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years hard labour. The judge described the sentence the maximum allowed as totally inadequate for a case such as this and that the case was the worst case I have ever tried. Wildes response And I May I say nothing my Lord was drowned out in cries of Shame in the courtroom. Although it is widely believed that the charges were related to Wildes consensual activities The Trials of Oscar Wilde which includes an original transcript of the libel trial suggests that he took advantage of teenagers. Antony Edmonds feels that Wilde would have faced prosecution today For example he certainly paid for sex with youths under the age of 18 which is a criminal offence. But even if his activities had led only to exposure and not to arrest he would have been savagely pilloried in the media. Wilde was 39 when he seduced Alphonse Conway and Conway was an inexperienced boy of 16. However Oscar Wildes grandson Merlin Holland argues One is taking it out of context he was not an odious predator. The boys seemed to be willing partners and there appeared to be a relationship going on between him and them.Marriageable age in England was 16 at the time having been 13 as recently as 1885 the 1875 Offences against the Person Act 1875 raised the age of consent to 13 years old and a decade later the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raised the age of consent to 16 years old just ten years before the trial. When first I was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget who I was. It was ruinous advice. It is only by realising what I am that I have found comfort of any kind. Now I am advised by others to try on my release to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all. I know that would be equally fatal. It would mean that I would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else the beauty of the sun and moon the pageant of the seasons the music of daybreak and the silence of great nights the rain falling through the leaves or the dew creeping over the grass and making it silver would all be tainted for me and lose their healing power and their power of communicating joy. To regret ones own experiences is to arrest ones own development. To deny ones own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of ones own life. It is no less than a denial of the soul. Wilde was incarcerated from 25 May 1895 to 18 May 1897. He first entered Newgate Prison in London for processing then was moved to Pentonville Prison where the hard labour to which he had been sentenced consisted of many hours of walking a treadmill and picking oakum and where prisoners were allowed to read only the Bible and The Pilgrims Progress. A few months later he was moved to Wandsworth Prison in London. Inmates there also followed the regimen of hard labour hard fare and a hard bed which wore harshly on Wildes delicate health. In November he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger. His right ear drum was ruptured in the fall an injury that later contributed to his death. He spent two months in the infirmary. Richard B. Haldane the Liberal MP and reformer visited Wilde and had him transferred in November to Reading Gaol 30 miles west of London on 23 November 1895. The transfer itself was the lowest point of his incarceration as a crowd jeered and spat at him on the platform at Clapham Junction railway station . He spent the remainder of his sentence at Reading addressed and identified only as C.3.3 the occupant of the third cell on the third floor of C ward. About five months after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol Charles Thomas Wooldridge a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Wooldridge was sentenced to death and returned to Reading for his execution which took place on Tuesday 7 July 1896 the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. From Wooldridges hanging Wilde later wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Wilde was not at first even allowed paper and pen but Haldane eventually succeeded in allowing access to books and writing materials. Wilde requested among others the Bible in French; Italian and German grammars; some Ancient Greek texts; Dantes Divine Comedy; Joris-Karl Huysmanss new French novel about Christian redemption En route; and essays by St Augustine Cardinal Newman and Walter Pater. Between January and March 1897 Wilde wrote a 50000-word letter to Douglas. He was not allowed to send it but was permitted to take it with him when released from prison. In reflective mode Wilde coldly examines his career to date how he had been a colourful agent provocateur in Victorian society his art like his paradoxes seeking to subvert as well as sparkle. His own estimation of himself was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age. It was from these heights that his life with Douglas began and Wilde examines that particularly closely repudiating him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity he had not forgotten Douglas remark when he was ill When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting. Wilde blamed himself though for the ethical degradation of character that he allowed Douglas to bring about in him and took responsibility for his own fall I am here for having tried to put your father in prison. The first half concludes with Wilde forgiving Douglas for his own sake as much as Douglass. The second half of the letter traces Wildes spiritual journey of redemption and fulfilment through his prison reading. He realised that his ordeal had filled his soul with the fruit of experience however bitter it tasted at the time. Wilde was released from prison on 19 May 1897 and sailed that evening for Dieppe France. He never returned to the United Kingdom. On his release he gave the manuscript to Ross who may or may not have carried out Wildes instructions to send a copy to Douglas . The letter was partially published in 1905 as De Profundis; its complete and correct publication first occurred in 1962 in The Letters of Oscar Wilde. Though Wildes health had suffered greatly from the harshness and diet of prison he had a feeling of spiritual renewal. He immediately wrote to the Society of Jesus requesting a six-month Catholic retreat; when the request was denied Wilde wept. I intend to be received into the Catholic Church before long Wilde told a journalist who asked about his religious intentions. He spent his last three years impoverished and in exile. He took the name Sebastian Melmoth after Saint Sebastian and the titular character of Melmoth the Wanderer . Wilde wrote two long letters to the editor of the Daily Chronicle describing the brutal conditions of English prisons and advocating penal reform. His discussion of the dismissal of Warder Martin for giving biscuits to an anaemic child prisoner repeated the themes of the corruption and degeneration of punishment that he had earlier outlined in The Soul of Man under Socialism. Wilde spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in the seaside village of Berneval-le-Grand in northern France where he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity. It moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them but rather the poem highlights the brutality of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line Yet each man kills the thing he loves. He adopted the proletarian ballad form and the author was credited as C33 Wildes cell number in Reading Gaol. He suggested that it be published in Reynolds Magazine because it circulates widely among the criminal classes to which I now belong for once I will be read by my peers a new experience for me. It was an immediate roaring commercial success going through seven editions in less than two years only after which was added to the title page though many in literary circles had known Wilde to be the author. Although Douglas had been the cause of his misfortunes he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons though she sent him money three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897 Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds. Wildes final address was at the dingy Hôtel dAlsace on rue des Beaux-Arts in Saint-Germain-des-Prés Paris. This poverty really breaks ones heart it is so sale so utterly depressing so hopeless. Pray do what you can he wrote to his publisher. He corrected and published An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest the proofs of which according to Ellmann show a man very much in command of himself and of the play but he refused to write anything else I can write but have lost the joy of writing. He wandered the boulevards alone and spent what little money he had on alcohol. A series of embarrassing chance encounters with hostile English visitors or Frenchmen he had known in better days drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke on one of his final trips outside My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go. On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross Terribly weak. Please come. His moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald Reggie Turner had found Wilde very depressed after a nightmare. I dreamt that I had died and was supping with the dead I am sure Turner replied that you must have been the life and soul of the party. By 25 November 1900 Wilde had developed meningitis then called cerebral meningitis. Robbie Ross arrived on 29 November sent for a priest and Wilde was conditionally baptised into the Catholic Church by Fr Cuthbert Dunne a Passionist priest from Dublin Wilde having been baptised in the Church of Ireland and having moreover a recollection of Catholic baptism as a child a fact later attested to by the minister of the sacrament Fr Lawrence Fox. Fr Dunne recorded the baptism Wilde died of meningitis on 30 November 1900. Different opinions are given as to the cause of the disease Richard Ellmann judged it was syphilitic; Merlin Holland Wildes grandson thought this to be a misconception noting that Wildes meningitis followed a surgical intervention perhaps a mastoidectomy; Wildes physicians Paul Cleiss and ACourt Tucker reported that the condition stemmed from an old suppuration of the right ear treated for several years and made no allusion to syphilis. Wilde was initially buried in the Cimetière de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery inside the city.His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross who asked for a small compartment to be made for his own ashes which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia which were initially censored by French authorities with a golden leaf. The genitals have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000 Leon Johnson a multimedia artist installed a silver prosthesis to replace them. In 2011 the tomb was cleaned of the many lipstick marks left there by admirers and a glass barrier was installed to prevent further marks or damage. The epitaph is a verse from The Ballad of Reading Gaol And alien tears will fill for himPitys long-broken urnFor his mourners will be outcast menAnd outcasts always mourn. In 2017 Wilde was among an estimated 50000 men who were pardoned for homosexual acts that were no longer considered offences under the Policing and Crime Act 2017 . The 2017 Act implements what is known informally as the Alan Turing law. On 14 February 1995 Wilde was commemorated with a stained-glass window at Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey. The memorial above the monument to Geoffrey Chaucer was unveiled by his grandson Merlin Holland while Sir John Gielgud read from the final part of De Profundis and Dame Judi Dench read an extract from The Importance of Being Earnest. In 2014 Wilde was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk a walk of fame in San Franciscos Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have made significant contributions in their fields. The Oscar Wilde Temple an installation by visual artists McDermott McGough opened in 2017 in cooperation with Church of the Village in New York City then moved to Studio Voltaire in London the next year. Wildes life has been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches but are sometimes factually unreliable.Frank Harris his friend and editor wrote a biography Oscar Wilde His Life and Confessions ; though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde.Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland vindictively reacted to Douglass discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wildes scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later in Oscar Wilde A Summing Up and his Autobiography Douglas was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wildes other close friends Robert Sherard; Robert Ross his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde His Life and Wit . In 1954 Wildes son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde which recounts the difficulties Wildes wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989. Oscar Wilde a critical study by Arthur Ransome was published in 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wildes life but subsequently Ransome were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. At the High Court in London in April 1913 Douglas lost the libel action after a reading of De Profundis refuted his claims. Richard Ellmann wrote his 1987 biography Oscar Wilde for which he posthumously won a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 and a Pulitzer Prize in 1989. The book was the basis for the 1997 film Wilde directed by Brian Gilbert and starring Stephen Fry as the title character. Neil McKennas 2003 biography The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde offers an exploration of Wildes sexuality. Often speculative in nature it was widely criticised for its pure conjecture and lack of scholarly rigour. Thomas Wrights Oscars Books explores Wildes reading from his childhood in Dublin to his death in Paris. After tracking down many books that once belonged to Wildes Tite Street library Wright was the first to examine Wildes marginalia. Later on I think everyone will recognise his achievements; his plays and essays will endure. Of course you may think with others that his personality and conversation were far more wonderful than anything he wrote so that his written works give only a pale reflection of his power. Perhaps that is so and of course it will be impossible to reproduce what is gone forever. In 2018 Matthew Sturgis Oscar A Life was published in London. The book incorporates rediscovered letters and other documents and is the most extensively researched biography of Wilde to appear since 1988.Rupert Everett starred as Wilde in and wrote the screenplay for The Happy Prince a biographical drama film about Wilde following his release from prison. Parisian literati also produced several biographies and monographs on him. André Gide wrote In Memoriam Oscar Wilde and Wilde also features in his journals. Thomas Louis who had earlier translated books on Wilde into French produced his own Lesprit dOscar Wilde in 1920. Modern books include Philippe Jullians Oscar Wilde and Laffaire Oscar Wilde ou Du danger de laisser la justice mettre le nez dans nos draps by Odon Vallet a French religious historian.
George Bernard Shaw,George Bernard Shaw known at his insistence as Bernard Shaw was an Irish playwright critic polemicist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays including major works such as Man and Superman Pygmalion and Saint Joan . With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Born in Dublin Shaw moved to London in 1876 where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success Arms and the Man in 1894. Influenced by Henrik Ibsen he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included Major Barbara The Doctors Dilemma and Caesar and Cleopatra. Shaws expressed views were often contentious; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform and opposed vaccination and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable and although not a republican castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of Pygmalion for which he received an Academy Award. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s he had largely renounced Fabian Society gradualism and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and lefthe expressed admiration for both Mussolini and Stalin. In the final decade of his life he made fewer public statements but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death aged ninety-four having refused all state honours including the Order of Merit in 1946. Since Shaws death scholarly and critical opinion about his works has varied but he has regularly been rated among British dramatists as second only to Shakespeare; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights. The word Shavian has entered the language as encapsulating Shaws ideas and his means of expressing them. Shaw was born at 3 Upper Synge Street in Portobello a lower-middle-class part of Dublin. He was the youngest child and only son of George Carr Shaw and Lucinda Elizabeth Shaw . His elder siblings were Lucinda Frances and Elinor Agnes . The Shaw family was of English descent and belonged to the dominant Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland; George Carr Shaw an ineffectual alcoholic was among the familys less successful members. His relatives secured him a sinecure in the civil service from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant. In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; in the view of Shaws biographer Michael Holroyd she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt. If as Holroyd and others surmise Georges motives were mercenary then he was disappointed as Bessie brought him little of her familys money. She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of shabby-genteel poverty. By the time of Shaws birth his mother had become close to George John Lee a flamboyant figure well known in Dublins musical circles. Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father; there is no consensus among Shavian scholars on the likelihood of this. The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply. He found solace in the music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine mezzo-soprano voice and was much influenced by Lees unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws house was often filled with music with frequent gatherings of singers and players. In 1862 Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a house No. 1 Hatch Street in an affluent part of Dublin and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill overlooking Killiney Bay. Shaw a sensitive boy found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing and was happier at the cottage. Lees students often gave him books which the young Shaw read avidly; thus as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature. Between 1865 and 1871 Shaw attended four schools all of which he hated. His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education Schools and schoolmasters he later wrote were prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents. In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents where he worked hard and quickly rose to become head cashier. During this period Shaw was known as George Shaw; after 1876 he dropped the George and styled himself Bernard Shaw. In June 1873 Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her. Shaws explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latters financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up. Left in Dublin with his father Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano. Early in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of tuberculosis. He resigned from the land agents and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agness funeral. He never again lived in Ireland and did not visit it for twenty-nine years. Initially Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter and had not yet thought of writing for a living but Lee found a little work for him ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lees name in a satirical weekly The Hornet. Lees relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer. Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a readers pass for the British Museum Reading Room and spent most weekdays there reading and writing. His first attempt at drama begun in 1878 was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel Immaturity was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 187980 and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author. For the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881 for the sake of economy and increasingly as a matter of principle he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels The Irrational Knot and Love Among the Artists but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner. In 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the Zetetical Society whose objective was to search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race. Here he met Sidney Webb a junior civil servant who like Shaw was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship. Shaw later reflected You knew everything that I didnt know and I knew everything you didnt know... We had everything to learn from one another and brains enough to do it. Shaws next attempt at drama was a one-act playlet in French Un Petit Drame written in 1884 but not published in his lifetime. In the same year the critic William Archer suggested a collaboration with a plot by Archer and dialogue by Shaw. The project foundered but Shaw returned to the draft as the basis of Widowers Houses in 1892 and the connection with Archer proved of immense value to Shaws career. On 5 September 1882 Shaw attended a meeting at the Memorial Hall Farringdon addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read Georges book Progress and Poverty which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDFs founder H. M. Hyndman whom he found autocratic ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join ithe preferred he said to work with his intellectual equals. After reading a tract Why Are The Many Poor issued by the recently formed Fabian Society Shaw went to the societys next advertised meeting on 16 May 1884. He became a member in September and before the years end had provided the society with its first manifesto published as Fabian Tract No. 2. He joined the societys executive committee in January 1885 and later that year recruited Webb and also Annie Besant a fine orator. From 1885 to 1889 Shaw attended the fortnightly meetings of the British Economic Association; it was Holroyd observes the closest Shaw had ever come to university education. This experience changed his political ideas; he moved away from Marxism and became an apostle of gradualism. When in 188687 the Fabians debated whether to embrace anarchism as advocated by Charlotte Wilson Besant and others Shaw joined the majority in rejecting this approach. After a rally in Trafalgar Square addressed by Besant was violently broken up by the authorities on 13 November 1887 Shaw became convinced of the folly of attempting to challenge police power. Thereafter he largely accepted the principle of permeation as advocated by Webb the notion whereby socialism could best be achieved by infiltration of people and ideas into existing political parties. Throughout the 1880s the Fabian Society remained small its message of moderation frequently unheard among more strident voices. Its profile was raised in 1889 with the publication of Fabian Essays in Socialism edited by Shaw who also provided two of the essays. The second of these Transition details the case for gradualism and permeation asserting that the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious to everyone. In 1890 Shaw produced Tract No. 13 What Socialism Is a revision of an earlier tract in which Charlotte Wilson had defined socialism in anarchistic terms. In Shaws new version readers were assured that socialism can be brought about in a perfectly constitutional manner by democratic institutions. The mid-1880s marked a turning point in Shaws life both personally and professionally he lost his virginity had two novels published and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday when his shyness was overcome by Jane Patterson a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued not always smoothly for eight years. Shaws sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons. The published novels neither commercially successful were his two final efforts in this genre Cashel Byrons Profession written in 188283 and An Unsocial Socialist begun and finished in 1883. The latter was published as a serial in To-Day magazine in 1884 although it did not appear in book form until 1887. Cashel Byron appeared in magazine and book form in 1886. In 1884 and 1885 through the influence of Archer Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw who rejected the idea of art for arts sake and insisted that all great art must be didactic. Of Shaws various reviewing activities in the 1880s and 1890s it was as a music critic that he was best known. After serving as deputy in 1888 he became musical critic of The Star in February 1889 writing under the pen-name Corno di Bassetto. In May 1890 he moved back to The World where he wrote a weekly column as G.B.S. for more than four years. In the 2016 version of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Robert Anderson writes Shaws collected writings on music stand alone in their mastery of English and compulsive readability. Shaw ceased to be a salaried music critic in August 1894 but published occasional articles on the subject throughout his career his last in 1950. From 1895 to 1898 Shaw was the theatre critic for The Saturday Review edited by his friend Frank Harris. As at The World he used the by-line G.B.S. He campaigned against the artificial conventions and hypocrisies of the Victorian theatre and called for plays of real ideas and true characters. By this time he had embarked in earnest on a career as a playwright I had rashly taken up the case; and rather than let it collapse I manufactured the evidence. After using the plot of the aborted 1884 collaboration with Archer to complete Widowers Houses Shaw continued writing plays. At first he made slow progress; The Philanderer written in 1893 but not published until 1898 had to wait until 1905 for a stage production. Similarly Mrs Warrens Profession was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage. Shaws first play to bring him financial success was Arms and the Man a mock-Ruritanian comedy satirising conventions of love military honour and class. The press found the play overlong and accused Shaw of mediocrity sneering at heroism and patriotism heartless cleverness and copying W.S.Gilberts style. The public took a different view and the management of the theatre staged extra matinée performances to meet the demand. The play ran from April to July toured the provinces and was staged in New York. It earned him 341 in royalties in its first year a sufficient sum to enable him to give up his salaried post as a music critic. Among the cast of the London production was Florence Farr with whom Shaw had a romantic relationship between 1890 and 1894 much resented by Jenny Patterson. The success of Arms and the Man was not immediately replicated. Candida which presented a young woman making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons received a single performance in South Shields in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called The Man of Destiny had a single staging at Croydon. In the 1890s Shaws plays were better known in print than on the West End stage; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897 when Richard Mansfields production of the historical melodrama The Devils Disciple earned the author more than 2000 in royalties. In January 1893 as a Fabian delegate Shaw attended the Bradford conference which led to the foundation of the Independent Labour Party. He was sceptical about the new party and scorned the likelihood that it could switch the allegiance of the working class from sport to politics. He persuaded the conference to adopt resolutions abolishing indirect taxation and taxing unearned income to extinction. Back in London Shaw produced what Margaret Cole in her Fabian history terms a grand philippic against the minority Liberal administration that had taken power in 1892. To Your Tents O Israel excoriated the government for ignoring social issues and concentrating solely on Irish Home Rule a matter Shaw declared of no relevance to socialism. In 1894 the Fabian Society received a substantial bequest from a sympathiser Henry Hunt HutchinsonHolroyd mentions 10000. Webb who chaired the board of trustees appointed to supervise the legacy proposed to use most of it to found a school of economics and politics. Shaw demurred; he thought such a venture was contrary to the specified purpose of the legacy. He was eventually persuaded to support the proposal and the London School of Economics and Political Science opened in the summer of 1895. By the later 1890s Shaws political activities lessened as he concentrated on making his name as a dramatist. In 1897 he was persuaded to fill an uncontested vacancy for a vestryman in Londons St Pancras district. At least initially Shaw took to his municipal responsibilities seriously; when London government was reformed in 1899 and the St Pancras vestry became the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras he was elected to the newly formed borough council. In 1898 as a result of overwork Shaws health broke down. He was nursed by Charlotte Payne-Townshend a rich Anglo-Irish woman whom he had met through the Webbs. The previous year she had proposed that she and Shaw should marry. He had declined but when she insisted on nursing him in a house in the country Shaw concerned that this might cause scandal agreed to their marriage. The ceremony took place on 1 June 1898 in the register office in Covent Garden. The bride and bridegroom were both aged forty-one. In the view of the biographer and critic St John Ervine their life together was entirely felicitous. There were no children of the marriage which it is generally believed was never consummated; whether this was wholly at Charlottes wish as Shaw liked to suggest is less widely credited. In the early weeks of the marriage Shaw was much occupied writing his Marxist analysis of Wagners Ring cycle published as The Perfect Wagnerite late in 1898. In 1906 the Shaws found a country home in Ayot St Lawrence Hertfordshire; they renamed the house Shaws Corner and lived there for the rest of their lives. They retained a London flat in the Adelphi and later at Whitehall Court. During the first decade of the twentieth century Shaw secured a firm reputation as a playwright. In 1904 J. E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker established a company at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square Chelsea to present modern drama. Over the next five years they staged fourteen of Shaws plays. The first John Bulls Other Island a comedy about an Englishman in Ireland attracted leading politicians and was seen by Edward VII who laughed so much that he broke his chair. The play was withheld from Dublins Abbey Theatre for fear of the affront it might provoke although it was shown at the citys Royal Theatre in November 1907. Shaw later wrote that William Butler Yeats who had requested the play got rather more than he bargained for... It was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo-Gaelic movement which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland. Nonetheless Shaw and Yeats were close friends; Yeats and Lady Gregory tried unsuccessfully to persuade Shaw to take up the vacant co-directorship of the Abbey Theatre after J. M. Synges death in 1909. Shaw admired other figures in the Irish Literary Revival including George Russell and James Joyce and was a close friend of Seán OCasey who was inspired to become a playwright after reading John Bulls Other Island. Man and Superman completed in 1902 was a success both at the Royal Court in 1905 and in Robert Loraines New York production in the same year. Among the other Shaw works presented by Vedrenne and Granville-Barker were Major Barbara depicting the contrasting morality of arms manufacturers and the Salvation Army;The Doctors Dilemma a mostly serious piece about professional ethics; and Caesar and Cleopatra Shaws counterblast to Shakespeares Antony and Cleopatra seen in New York in 1906 and in London the following year. Now prosperous and established Shaw experimented with unorthodox theatrical forms described by his biographer Stanley Weintraub as discussion drama and serious farce. These plays included Getting Married The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet Misalliance and Fannys First Play . Blanco Posnet was banned on religious grounds by the Lord Chamberlain and was produced instead in Dublin; it filled the Abbey Theatre to capacity.Fannys First Play a comedy about suffragettes had the longest initial run of any Shaw play622 performances. Androcles and the Lion a less heretical study of true and false religious attitudes than Blanco Posnet ran for eight weeks in September and October 1913. It was followed by one of Shaws most successful plays Pygmalion written in 1912 and staged in Vienna the following year and in Berlin shortly afterwards. Shaw commented It is the custom of the English press when a play of mine is produced to inform the world that it is not a playthat it is dull blasphemous unpopular and financially unsuccessful.... Hence arose an urgent demand on the part of the managers of Vienna and Berlin that I should have my plays performed by them first. The British production opened in April 1914 starring Sir Herbert Tree and Mrs Patrick Campbell as respectively a professor of phonetics and a cockney flower-girl. There had earlier been a romantic liaison between Shaw and Campbell that caused Charlotte Shaw considerable concern but by the time of the London premiere it had ended. The play attracted capacity audiences until July when Tree insisted on going on holiday and the production closed. His co-star then toured with the piece in the US. In 1899 when the Boer War began Shaw wished the Fabians to take a neutral stance on what he deemed like Home Rule to be a non-Socialist issue. Others including the future Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald wanted unequivocal opposition and resigned from the society when it followed Shaw. In the Fabians war manifesto Fabianism and the Empire Shaw declared that until the Federation of the World becomes an accomplished fact we must accept the most responsible Imperial federations available as a substitute for it. As the new century began Shaw became increasingly disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics. Thus although a nominated Fabian delegate he did not attend the London conference at the Memorial Hall Farringdon Street in February 1900 that created the Labour Representation Committeeprecursor of the modern Labour Party. By 1903 when his term as borough councillor expired he had lost his earlier enthusiasm writing After six years of Borough Councilling I am convinced that the borough councils should be abolished. Nevertheless in 1904 he stood in the London County Council elections. After an eccentric campaign which Holroyd characterises as absolutely certain of not getting in he was duly defeated. It was Shaws final foray into electoral politics. Nationally the 1906 general election produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members. Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and saw the Labour members as inconsequential I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body. In the years after the 1906 election Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership and saw this in the form of his fellow-writer H. G. Wells who had joined the society in February 1903. Wellss ideas for reformparticularly his proposals for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Partyplaced him at odds with the societys Old Gang led by Shaw. According to Cole Wells had minimal capacity for putting across in public meetings against Shaws trained and practised virtuosity. In Shaws view the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells he annihilated himself. Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member but left the executive in April 1911. He later wondered whether the Old Gang should have given way to Wells some years earlier God only knows whether the Society had not better have done it. Although less activehe blamed his advancing yearsShaw remained a Fabian. In 1912 Shaw invested 1000 for a one-fifth share in the Webbs new publishing venture a socialist weekly magazine called The New Statesman which appeared in April 1913. He became a founding director publicist and in due course a contributor mostly anonymously. He was soon at odds with the magazines editor Clifford Sharp who by 1916 was rejecting his contributionsthe only paper in the world that refuses to print anything by me according to Shaw. After the First World War began in August 1914 Shaw produced his tract Common Sense About the War which argued that the warring nations were equally culpable. Such a view was anathema in an atmosphere of fervent patriotism and offended many of Shaws friends; Ervine records that is appearance at any public function caused the instant departure of many of those present. Despite his errant reputation Shaws propagandist skills were recognised by the British authorities and early in 1917 he was invited by Field Marshal Haig to visit the Western Front battlefields. Shaws 10000-word report which emphasised the human aspects of the soldiers life was well received and he became less of a lone voice. In April 1917 he joined the national consensus in welcoming Americas entry into the war a first class moral asset to the common cause against junkerism. Three short plays by Shaw were premiered during the war. The Inca of Perusalem written in 1915 encountered problems with the censor for burlesquing not only the enemy but the British military command; it was performed in 1916 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.OFlaherty V.C. satirising the governments attitude to Irish recruits was banned in the UK and was presented at a Royal Flying Corps base in Belgium in 1917. Augustus Does His Bit a genial farce was granted a licence; it opened at the Royal Court in January 1917. Shaw had long supported the principle of Irish Home Rule within the British Empire .In April 1916 he wrote scathingly in The New York Times about militant Irish nationalism In point of learning nothing and forgetting nothing these fellow-patriots of mine leave the Bourbons nowhere. Total independence he asserted was impractical; alliance with a bigger power was essential. The Dublin Easter Rising later that month took him by surprise. After its suppression by British forces he expressed horror at the summary execution of the rebel leaders but continued to believe in some form of Anglo-Irish union. In How to Settle the Irish Question he envisaged a federal arrangement with national and imperial parliaments. Holroyd records that by this time the separatist party Sinn Féin was in the ascendency and Shaws and other moderate schemes were forgotten. In the postwar period Shaw despaired of the British governments coercive policies towards Ireland and joined his fellow-writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton in publicly condemning these actions. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 led to the partition of Ireland between north and south a provision that dismayed Shaw. In 1922 civil war broke out in the south between its pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions the former of whom had established the Irish Free State. Shaw visited Dublin in August and met Michael Collins then head of the Free States Provisional Government. Shaw was much impressed by Collins and was saddened when three days later the Irish leader was ambushed and killed by anti-treaty forces. In a letter to Collinss sister Shaw wrote I met Michael for the first and last time on Saturday last and am very glad I did. I rejoice in his memory and will not be so disloyal to it as to snivel over his valiant death. Shaw remained a British subject all his life but took dual British-Irish nationality in 1934. Shaws first major work to appear after the war was Heartbreak House written in 191617 and performed in 1920. It was produced on Broadway in November and was coolly received; according to The Times Mr Shaw on this occasion has more than usual to say and takes twice as long as usual to say it. After the London premiere in October 1921 The Times concurred with the American critics As usual with Mr Shaw the play is about an hour too long although containing much entertainment and some profitable reflection. Ervine in The Observer thought the play brilliant but ponderously acted except for Edith Evans as Lady Utterword. Shaws largest-scale theatrical work was Back to Methuselah written in 191820 and staged in 1922. Weintraub describes it as Shaws attempt to fend off the bottomless pit of an utterly discouraging pessimism. This cycle of five interrelated plays depicts evolution and the effects of longevity from the Garden of Eden to the year 31920 AD. Critics found the five plays strikingly uneven in quality and invention. The original run was brief and the work has been revived infrequently. Shaw felt he had exhausted his remaining creative powers in the huge span of this Metabiological Pentateuch. He was now sixty-seven and expected to write no more plays. This mood was short-lived. In 1920 Joan of Arc was proclaimed a saint by Pope Benedict XV; Shaw had long found Joan an interesting historical character and his view of her veered between half-witted genius and someone of exceptional sanity. He had considered writing a play about her in 1913 and the canonisation prompted him to return to the subject. He wrote Saint Joan in the middle months of 1923 and the play was premiered on Broadway in December. It was enthusiastically received there and at its London premiere the following March. In Weintraubs phrase even the Nobel prize committee could no longer ignore Shaw after Saint Joan. The citation for the literature prize for 1925 praised his work as ...marked by both idealism and humanity its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty. He accepted the award but rejected the monetary prize that went with it on the grounds that My readers and my audiences provide me with more than sufficient money for my needs. After Saint Joan it was five years before Shaw wrote a play. From 1924 he spent four years writing what he described as his magnum opus a political treatise entitled The Intelligent Womans Guide to Socialism and Capitalism. The book was published in 1928 and sold well. At the end of the decade Shaw produced his final Fabian tract a commentary on the League of Nations. He described the League as a school for the new international statesmanship as against the old Foreign Office diplomacy but thought that it had not yet become the Federation of the World. Shaw returned to the theatre with what he called a political extravaganza The Apple Cart written in late 1928. It was in Ervines view unexpectedly popular taking a conservative monarchist anti-democratic line that appealed to contemporary audiences. The premiere was in Warsaw in June 1928 and the first British production was two months later at Sir Barry Jacksons inaugural Malvern Festival. The other eminent creative artist most closely associated with the festival was Sir Edward Elgar with whom Shaw enjoyed a deep friendship and mutual regard. He described The Apple Cart to Elgar as a scandalous Aristophanic burlesque of democratic politics with a brief but shocking sex interlude. During the 1920s Shaw began to lose faith in the idea that society could be changed through Fabian gradualism and became increasingly fascinated with dictatorial methods. In 1922 he had welcomed Mussolinis accession to power in Italy observing that amid the indiscipline and muddle and Parliamentary deadlock Mussolini was the right kind of tyrant. Shaw was prepared to tolerate certain dictatorial excesses; Weintraub in his ODNB biographical sketch comments that Shaws flirtation with authoritarian inter-war regimes took a long time to fade and Beatrice Webb thought he was obsessed about Mussolini. Letter to The Manchester Guardian 2 March 1933 signed by Shaw and 20 others. Shaws enthusiasm for the Soviet Union dated to the early 1920s when he had hailed Lenin as the one really interesting statesman in Europe. Having turned down several chances to visit in 1931 he joined a party led by Nancy Astor. The carefully managed trip culminated in a lengthy meeting with Stalin whom Shaw later described as a Georgian gentleman with no malice in him. At a dinner given in his honour Shaw told the gathering I have seen all the terrors and I was terribly pleased by them. In March 1933 Shaw was a co-signatory to a letter in The Manchester Guardian protesting at the continuing misrepresentation of Soviet achievements No lie is too fantastic no slander is too stale... for employment by the more reckless elements of the British press. Shaws admiration for Mussolini and Stalin demonstrated his growing belief that dictatorship was the only viable political arrangement. When the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in January 1933 Shaw described Hitler as a very remarkable man a very able man and professed himself proud to be the only writer in England who was scrupulously polite and just to Hitler. His principal admiration was for Stalin whose regime he championed uncritically throughout the decade. Shaw saw the 1939 MolotovRibbentrop Pact as a triumph for Stalin who he said now had Hitler under his thumb. Shaws first play of the decade was Too True to be Good written in 1931 and premiered in Boston in February 1932. The reception was unenthusiastic. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times commenting that Shaw had yielded to the impulse to write without having a subject judged the play a rambling and indifferently tedious conversation. The correspondent of The New York Herald Tribune said that most of the play was discourse unbelievably long lectures and that although the audience enjoyed the play it was bewildered by it. During the decade Shaw travelled widely and frequently. Most of his journeys were with Charlotte; she enjoyed voyages on ocean liners and he found peace to write during the long spells at sea. Shaw met an enthusiastic welcome in South Africa in 1932 despite his strong remarks about the racial divisions of the country. In December 1932 the couple embarked on a round-the-world cruise. In March 1933 they arrived at San Francisco to begin Shaws first visit to the US. He had earlier refused to go to that awful country that uncivilized place unfit to govern itself... illiberal superstitious crude violent anarchic and arbitrary. He visited Hollywood with which he was unimpressed and New York where he lectured to a capacity audience in the Metropolitan Opera House. Harried by the intrusive attentions of the press Shaw was glad when his ship sailed from New York harbour. New Zealand which he and Charlotte visited the following year struck him as the best country Ive been in; he urged its people to be more confident and loosen their dependence on trade with Britain. He used the weeks at sea to complete two playsThe Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles and The Six of Calaisand begin work on a third The Millionairess. Despite his contempt for Hollywood and its aesthetic values Shaw was enthusiastic about cinema and in the middle of the decade wrote screenplays for prospective film versions of Pygmalion and Saint Joan. The latter was never made but Shaw entrusted the rights to the former to the unknown Gabriel Pascal who produced it at Pinewood Studios in 1938. Shaw was determined that Hollywood should have nothing to do with the film but was powerless to prevent it from winning one Academy Award ; he described his award for best-written screenplay as an insult coming from such a source. He became the first person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. In a 1993 study of the Oscars Anthony Holden observes that Pygmalion was soon spoken of as having lifted movie-making from illiteracy to literacy. Shaws final plays of the 1930s were Cymbeline Refinished Geneva and In Good King Charless Golden Days . The first a fantasy reworking of Shakespeare made little impression but the second a satire on European dictators attracted more notice much of it unfavourable. In particular Shaws parody of Hitler as Herr Battler was considered mild almost sympathetic. The third play an historical conversation piece first seen at Malvern ran briefly in London in May 1940.James Agate commented that the play contained nothing to which even the most conservative audiences could take exception and though it was long and lacking in dramatic action only witless and idle theatregoers would object. After their first runs none of the three plays were seen again in the West End during Shaws lifetime. Towards the end of the decade both Shaws began to suffer ill health. Charlotte was increasingly incapacitated by Pagets disease of bone and he developed pernicious anaemia. His treatment involving injections of concentrated animal liver was successful but this breach of his vegetarian creed distressed him and brought down condemnation from militant vegetarians. Although Shaws works since The Apple Cart had been received without great enthusiasm his earlier plays were revived in the West End throughout the Second World War starring such actors as Edith Evans John Gielgud Deborah Kerr and Robert Donat. In 1944 nine Shaw plays were staged in London including Arms and the Man with Ralph Richardson Laurence Olivier Sybil Thorndike and Margaret Leighton in the leading roles. Two touring companies took his plays all round Britain. The revival in his popularity did not tempt Shaw to write a new play and he concentrated on prolific journalism. A second Shaw film produced by Pascal Major Barbara was less successful both artistically and commercially than Pygmalion partly because of Pascals insistence on directing to which he was unsuited. Following the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland Shaw was accused of defeatism when in a New Statesman article he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The London blitz of 194041 led the Shaws both in their mid-eighties to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. Even there they were not immune from enemy air raids and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house Cliveden. In 1943 the worst of the London bombing over the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged. Her condition deteriorated and she died in September. Shaws final political treatise Everybodys Political Whats What was published in 1944. Holroyd describes this as a rambling narrative... that repeats ideas he had given better elsewhere and then repeats itself. The book sold well85000 copies by the end of the year. After Hitlers suicide in May 1945 Shaw approved of the formal condolences offered by the Irish Taoiseach Éamon de Valera at the German embassy in Dublin. Shaw disapproved of the postwar trials of the defeated German leaders as an act of self-righteousness We are all potential criminals. Pascal was given a third opportunity to film Shaws work with Caesar and Cleopatra . It cost three times its original budget and was rated the biggest financial failure in the history of British cinema. The film was poorly received by British critics although American reviews were friendlier. Shaw thought its lavishness nullified the drama and he considered the film a poor imitation of Cecil B. de Mille. In 1946 the year of Shaws ninetieth birthday he accepted the freedom of Dublin and became the first honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras London. In the same year the British government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the Order of Merit. He declined believing that an authors merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication as The Crime of Imprisonment of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions. It was widely praised; a reviewer in the American Journal of Public Health considered it essential reading for any student of the American criminal justice system. Shaw continued to write into his nineties. His last plays were Buoyant Billions his final full-length work; Farfetched Fables a set of six short plays revisiting several of his earlier themes such as evolution; a comic play for puppets Shakes versus Shav a ten-minute piece in which Shakespeare and Shaw trade insults; and Why She Would Not which Shaw described as a little comedy written in one week shortly before his ninety-fourth birthday. During his later years Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaws Corner. He died at the age of ninety-four of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a tree. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950. His ashes mixed with those of Charlotte were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their garden. Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934 comprising forty-two works. He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life mostly one-act pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works the total is sixty-two. Shaws first three full-length plays dealt with social issues. He later grouped them as Plays Unpleasant.Widowers Houses concerns the landlords of slum properties and introduces the first of Shaws New Womena recurring feature of later plays.The Philanderer develops the theme of the New Woman draws on Ibsen and has elements of Shaws personal relationships the character of Julia being based on Jenny Patterson. In a 2003 study Judith Evans describes Mrs Warrens Profession as undoubtedly the most challenging of the three Plays Unpleasant taking Mrs Warrens professionprostitute and later brothel-owneras a metaphor for a prostituted society. Shaw followed the first trilogy with a second published as Plays Pleasant.Arms and the Man conceals beneath a mock-Ruritanian comic romance a Fabian parable contrasting impractical idealism with pragmatic socialism. The central theme of Candida is a womans choice between two men; the play contrasts the outlook and aspirations of a Christian Socialist and a poetic idealist. The third of the Pleasant group You Never Can Tell portrays social mobility and the gap between generations particularly in how they approach social relations in general and mating in particular. The Three Plays for Puritanscomprising The Devils Disciple Caesar and Cleopatra and Captain Brassbounds Conversion all centre on questions of empire and imperialism a major topic of political discourse in the 1890s. The three are set respectively in 1770s America Ancient Egypt and 1890s Morocco.The Gadfly an adaptation of the popular novel by Ethel Voynich was unfinished and unperformed.The Man of Destiny is a short curtain raiser about Napoleon. Shaws major plays of the first decade of the twentieth century address individual social political or ethical issues. Man and Superman stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment giving Shaws interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text.The Admirable Bashville a blank verse dramatisation of Shaws novel Cashel Byrons Profession focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa.John Bulls Other Island comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years.Major Barbara presents ethical questions in an unconventional way confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter.The Doctors Dilemma a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death and here did so with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero. Getting Married and Misalliance the latter seen by Judith Evans as a companion piece to the formerare both in what Shaw called his disquisitionary vein with the emphasis on discussion of ideas rather than on dramatic events or vivid characterisation. Shaw wrote seven short plays during the decade; they are all comedies ranging from the deliberately absurd Passion Poison and Petrifaction to the satirical Press Cuttings . In the decade from 1910 to the aftermath of the First World War Shaw wrote four full-length plays the third and fourth of which are among his most frequently staged works.Fannys First Play continues his earlier examinations of middle-class British society from a Fabian viewpoint with additional touches of melodrama and an epilogue in which theatre critics discuss the play.Androcles and the Lion which Shaw began writing as a play for children became a study of the nature of religion and how to put Christian precepts into practice.Pygmalion is a Shavian study of language and speech and their importance in society and in personal relationships. To correct the impression left by the original performers that the play portrayed a romantic relationship between the two main characters Shaw rewrote the ending to make it clear that the heroine will marry another minor character. Shaws only full-length play from the war years is Heartbreak House which in his words depicts cultured leisured Europe before the war drifting towards disaster. Shaw named Shakespeare and Chekhov as important influences on the piece and critics have found elements drawing on Congreve and Ibsen . The short plays range from genial historical drama in The Dark Lady of the Sonnets and Great Catherine to a study of polygamy in Overruled; three satirical works about the war ; a piece that Shaw called utter nonsense and a brief sketch about a Bolshevik empress . Saint Joan drew widespread praise both for Shaw and for Sybil Thorndike for whom he wrote the title role and who created the part in Britain. In the view of the commentator Nicholas Grene Shaws Joan a no-nonsense mystic Protestant and nationalist before her time is among the 20th centurys classic leading female roles.The Apple Cart was Shaws last popular success. He gave both that play and its successor Too True to Be Good the subtitle A political extravaganza although the two works differ greatly in their themes; the first presents the politics of a nation and the second in Judith Evanss words is concerned with the social mores of the individual and is nebulous. Shaws plays of the 1930s were written in the shadow of worsening national and international political events. Once again with On the Rocks and The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles a political comedy with a clear plot was followed by an introspective drama. The first play portrays a British prime minister considering but finally rejecting the establishment of a dictatorship; the second is concerned with polygamy and eugenics and ends with the Day of Judgement. The Millionairess is a farcical depiction of the commercial and social affairs of a successful businesswoman. Geneva lampoons the feebleness of the League of Nations compared with the dictators of Europe. In Good King Charless Golden Days described by Weintraub as a warm discursive high comedy also depicts authoritarianism but less satirically than Geneva. As in earlier decades the shorter plays were generally comedies some historical and others addressing various political and social preoccupations of the author. Ervine writes of Shaws later work that although it was still astonishingly vigorous and vivacious it showed unmistakable signs of his age. The best of his work in this period however was full of wisdom and the beauty of mind often displayed by old men who keep their wits about them. Shaws collected musical criticism published in three volumes runs to more than 2700 pages. It covers the British musical scene from 1876 to 1950 but the core of the collection dates from his six years as music critic of The Star and The World in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In his view music criticism should be interesting to everyone rather than just the musical élite and he wrote for the non-specialist avoiding technical jargonMesopotamian words like the dominant of D major. He was fiercely partisan in his columns promoting the music of Wagner and decrying that of Brahms and those British composers such as Stanford and Parry whom he saw as Brahmsian. He campaigned against the prevailing fashion for performances of Handel oratorios with huge amateur choirs and inflated orchestration calling for a chorus of twenty capable artists. He railed against opera productions unrealistically staged or sung in languages the audience did not speak. In Shaws view the London theatres of the 1890s presented too many revivals of old plays and not enough new work. He campaigned against melodrama sentimentality stereotypes and worn-out conventions. As a music critic he had frequently been able to concentrate on analysing new works but in the theatre he was often obliged to fall back on discussing how various performers tackled well-known plays. In a study of Shaws work as a theatre critic E. J. West writes that Shaw ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique. Shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for The Saturday Review in which he assessed more than 212 productions. He championed Ibsens plays when many theatregoers regarded them as outrageous and his 1891 book Quintessence of Ibsenism remained a classic throughout the twentieth century. Of contemporary dramatists writing for the West End stage he rated Oscar Wilde above the rest ...our only thorough playwright. He plays with everything with wit with philosophy with drama with actors and audience with the whole theatre. Shaws collected criticisms were published as Our Theatres in the Nineties in 1932. Shaw maintained a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare . Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain. Shaw was nevertheless a knowledgeable Shakespearian and in an article in which he wrote With the single exception of Homer there is no eminent writer not even Sir Walter Scott whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his he also said But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers and will outlast a thousand more. Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare undiscriminating Bardolaters and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes The Dark Lady of the Sonnets Cymbeline Refinished and Shakes versus Shav. In a 2001 analysis of Shaws Shakespearian criticisms Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw who was no academic saw Shakespeares playslike all theatrefrom an authors practical point of view Shaw helps us to get away from the Romantics picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss or with a specific staging and cast of actors. Shaws political and social commentaries were published variously in Fabian tracts in essays in two full-length books in innumerable newspaper and journal articles and in prefaces to his plays. The majority of Shaws Fabian tracts were published anonymously representing the voice of the society rather than of Shaw although the societys secretary Edward Pease later confirmed Shaws authorship. According to Holroyd the business of the early Fabians mainly under the influence of Shaw was to alter history by rewriting it. Shaws talent as a pamphleteer was put to immediate use in the production of the societys manifestoafter which says Holroyd he was never again so succinct. After the turn of the twentieth century Shaw increasingly propagated his ideas through the medium of his plays. An early critic writing in 1904 observed that Shaws dramas provided a pleasant means of proselytising his socialism adding that Mr Shaws views are to be sought especially in the prefaces to his plays. After loosening his ties with the Fabian movement in 1911 Shaws writings were more personal and often provocative; his response to the furore following the issue of Common Sense About the War in 1914 was to prepare a sequel More Common Sense About the War. In this he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence. On the advice of Beatrice Webb this pamphlet remained unpublished. The Intelligent Womans Guide Shaws main political treatise of the 1920s attracted both admiration and criticism. MacDonald considered it the worlds most important book since the Bible;Harold Laski thought its arguments outdated and lacking in concern for individual freedoms. Shaws increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements. A New York Times report dated 10 December 1933 quoted a recent Fabian Society lecture in which Shaw had praised Hitler Mussolini and Stalin are adopting methods by which it is possible to get something done. As late as the Second World War in Everybodys Political Whats What Shaw blamed the Allies abuse of their 1918 victory for the rise of Hitler and hoped that after defeat the Führer would escape retribution to enjoy a comfortable retirement in Ireland or some other neutral country. These sentiments according to the Irish philosopher-poet Thomas Duddy rendered much of the Shavian outlook passé and contemptible. Shaws fiction-writing was largely confined to the five unsuccessful novels written in the period 18791885. Immaturity is a semi-autobiographical portrayal of mid-Victorian England Shaws own David Copperfield according to Weintraub.The Irrational Knot is a critique of conventional marriage in which Weintraub finds the characterisations lifeless hardly more than animated theories. Shaw was pleased with his third novel Love Among the Artists feeling that it marked a turning point in his development as a thinker although he had no more success with it than with its predecessors.Cashel Byrons Profession is says Weintraub an indictment of society which anticipates Shaws first full-length play Mrs Warrens Profession. Shaw later explained that he had intended An Unsocial Socialist as the first section of a monumental depiction of the downfall of capitalism. Gareth Griffith in a study of Shaws political thought sees the novel as an interesting record of conditions both in society at large and in the nascent socialist movement of the 1880s. Shaws only subsequent fiction of any substance was his 1932 novella The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God written during a visit to South Africa in 1932. The eponymous girl intelligent inquisitive and converted to Christianity by insubstantial missionary teaching sets out to find God on a journey that after many adventures and encounters leads her to a secular conclusion. The story on publication offended some Christians and was banned in Ireland by the Board of Censors. Shaw was a prolific correspondent throughout his life. His letters edited by Dan H. Laurence were published between 1965 and 1988. Shaw once estimated his letters would occupy twenty volumes; Laurence commented that unedited they would fill many more. Shaw wrote more than a quarter of a million letters of which about ten per cent have survived; 2653 letters are printed in Laurences four volumes. Among Shaws many regular correspondents were his childhood friend Edward McNulty; his theatrical colleagues Mrs Patrick Campbell and Ellen Terry; writers including Lord Alfred Douglas H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterton; the boxer Gene Tunney; the nun Laurentia McLachlan; and the art expert Sydney Cockerell. In 2007 a 316-page volume consisting entirely of Shaws letters to The Times was published. Shaws diaries for 18851897 edited by Weintraub were published in two volumes with a total of 1241 pages in 1986. Reviewing them the Shaw scholar Fred Crawford wrote Although the primary interest for Shavians is the material that supplements what we already know about Shaws life and work the diaries are also valuable as a historical and sociological document of English life at the end of the Victorian age. After 1897 pressure of other writing led Shaw to give up keeping a diary. Through his journalism pamphlets and occasional longer works Shaw wrote on many subjects. His range of interest and enquiry included vivisection vegetarianism religion language cinema and photography on all of which he wrote and spoke copiously. Collections of his writings on these and other subjects were published mainly after his death together with volumes of wit and wisdom and general journalism. Despite the many books written about him Shaws autobiographical output apart from his diaries was relatively slight. He gave interviews to newspapersGBS Confesses to The Daily Mail in 1904 is an exampleand provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published. In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce Shaw Gives Himself Away a miscellany which a year before his death he revised and republished as Sixteen Self Sketches . He made it clear to his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography. Shaw was a poseur and a puritan; he was similarly a bourgeois and an antibourgeois writer working for Hearst and posterity; his didacticism is entertaining and his pranks are purposeful; he supports socialism and is tempted by fascism. Throughout his lifetime Shaw professed many beliefs often contradictory. This inconsistency was partly an intentional provocationthe Spanish scholar-statesman Salvador de Madariaga describes Shaw as a pole of negative electricity set in a people of positive electricity. In one area at least Shaw was constant in his lifelong refusal to follow normal English forms of spelling and punctuation. He favoured archaic spellings such as shew for show; he dropped the u in words like honour and favour; and wherever possible he rejected the apostrophe in contractions such as wont or thats. In his will Shaw ordered that after some specified legacies his remaining assets were to form a trust to pay for fundamental reform of the English alphabet into a phonetic version of forty letters. Though Shaws intentions were clear his drafting was flawed and the courts initially ruled the intended trust void. A later out-of-court agreement provided a sum of 8300 for spelling reform; the bulk of his fortune went to the residuary legateesthe British Museum the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the National Gallery of Ireland. Most of the 8300 went on a special phonetic edition of Androcles and the Lion in the Shavian alphabet published in 1962 to a largely indifferent reception. Shaws views on religion and Christianity were less consistent. Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the Old Testament image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century he termed himself a mystic although Gary Sloan in an essay on Shaws beliefs disputes his credentials as such. In 1913 Shaw declared that he was not religious in the sectarian sense aligning himself with Jesus as a person of no religion. In the preface to Androcles and the Lion Shaw asks Why not give Christianity a chance contending that Britains social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount a very moving exhortation and it gives you one first-rate tip which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you. In his will Shaw stated that his religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution. He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation and that no memorial to him should take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice. Shaw espoused racial equality and inter-marriage between people of different races. Despite his expressed wish to be fair to Hitler he called anti-Semitism the hatred of the lazy ignorant fat-headed Gentile for the pertinacious Jew who schooled by adversity to use his brains to the utmost outdoes him in business. In The Jewish Chronicle he wrote in 1932 In every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against Jews Jesuits Armenians Negroes Freemasons Irishmen or simply foreigners as such. Political parties are not above exploiting these fears and jealousies. In 1903 Shaw joined in a controversy about vaccination against smallpox. He called vaccination a peculiarly filthy piece of witchcraft; in his view immunisation campaigns were a cheap and inadequate substitute for a decent programme of housing for the poor which would he declared be the means of eradicating smallpox and other infectious diseases. Less contentiously Shaw was keenly interested in transport; Laurence observed in 1992 a need for a published study of Shaws interest in bicycling motorbikes automobiles and planes climaxing in his joining the Interplanetary Society in his nineties. Shaw published articles on travel took photographs of his journeys and submitted notes to the Royal Automobile Club. Shaw strove throughout his adult life to be referred to as Bernard Shaw rather than George Bernard Shaw but confused matters by continuing to use his full initialsG.B.S.as a by-line and often signed himself G.Bernard Shaw. He left instructions in his will that his executor was to license publication of his works only under the name Bernard Shaw. Shaw scholars including Ervine Judith Evans Holroyd Laurence and Weintraub and many publishers have respected Shaws preference although the Cambridge University Press was among the exceptions with its 1988 Cambridge Companion to George Bernard Shaw. Shaw arguably the most important English-language playwright after Shakespeare produced an immense oeuvre of which at least half a dozen plays remain part of the world repertoire.... Academically unfashionable of limited influence even in areas such as Irish drama and British political theatre where influence might be expected Shaws unique and unmistakable plays keep escaping from the safely dated category of period piece to which they have often been consigned. Shaw did not found a school of dramatists as such but Crawford asserts that today we recognise as second only to Shakespeare in the British theatrical tradition... the proponent of the theater of ideas who struck a death-blow to 19th-century melodrama. According to Laurence Shaw pioneered intelligent theatre in which the audience was required to think thereby paving the way for the new breeds of twentieth-century playwrights from Galsworthy to Pinter. Crawford lists numerous playwrights whose work owes something to that of Shaw. Among those active in Shaws lifetime he includes Noël Coward who based his early comedy The Young Idea on You Never Can Tell and continued to draw on the older mans works in later plays.T. S. Eliot by no means an admirer of Shaw admitted that the epilogue of Murder in the Cathedral in which Beckets slayers explain their actions to the audience might have been influenced by Saint Joan. The critic Eric Bentley comments that Eliots later play The Confidential Clerk had all the earmarks of Shavianism... without the merits of the real Bernard Shaw. Among more recent British dramatists Crawford marks Tom Stoppard as the most Shavian of contemporary playwrights; Shaws serious farce is continued in the works of Stoppards contemporaries Alan Ayckbourn Henry Livings and Peter Nichols. Shaws influence crossed the Atlantic at an early stage. Bernard Dukore notes that he was successful as a dramatist in America ten years before achieving comparable success in Britain. Among many American writers professing a direct debt to Shaw Eugene ONeill became an admirer at the age of seventeen after reading The Quintessence of Ibsenism. Other Shaw-influenced American playwrights mentioned by Dukore are Elmer Rice for whom Shaw opened doors turned on lights and expanded horizons;William Saroyan who empathised with Shaw as the embattled individualist against the philistines; and S. N. Behrman who was inspired to write for the theatre after attending a performance of Caesar and Cleopatra I thought it would be agreeable to write plays like that. Assessing Shaws reputation in a 1976 critical study T. F. Evans described Shaw as unchallenged in his lifetime and since as the leading English-language dramatist of the century and as a master of prose style. The following year in a contrary assessment the playwright John Osborne castigated The Guardians theatre critic Michael Billington for referring to Shaw as the greatest British dramatist since Shakespeare. Osborne responded that Shaw is the most fraudulent inept writer of Victorian melodramas ever to gull a timid critic or fool a dull public. Despite this hostility Crawford sees the influence of Shaw in some of Osbornes plays and concludes that though the latters work is neither imitative nor derivative these affinities are sufficient to classify Osborne as an inheritor of Shaw. In a 1983 study R. J. Kaufmann suggests that Shaw was a key forerunnergodfather if not actually finicky paterfamiliasof the Theatre of the Absurd. Two further aspects of Shaws theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford his opposition to stage censorship which was finally ended in 1968 and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaws short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre was part of this campaign. Writing in The New Statesman in 2012 Daniel Janes commented that Shaws reputation had declined by the time of his 150th anniversary in 2006 but had recovered considerably. In Janess view the many current revivals of Shaws major works showed the playwrights almost unlimited relevance to our times. In the same year Mark Lawson wrote in The Guardian that Shaws moral concerns engaged present-day audiences and made himlike his model Ibsenone of the most popular playwrights in contemporary British theatre. The Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake Ontario Canada is the second largest repertory theatre company in North America. It produces plays by or written during the lifetime of Shaw as well as some contemporary works. The Gingold Theatrical Group founded in 2006 presents works by Shaw and others in New York City that feature the humanitarian ideals that his work promoted. It became the first theatre group to present all of Shaws stage work through its monthly concert series Project Shaw. In the 1940s the author Harold Nicolson advised the National Trust not to accept the bequest of Shaws Corner predicting that Shaw would be totally forgotten within fifty years. In the event Shaws broad cultural legacy embodied in the widely used term Shavian has endured and is nurtured by Shaw Societies in various parts of the world. The original society was founded in London in 1941 and survives; it organises meetings and events and publishes a regular bulletin The Shavian. The Shaw Society of America began in June 1950; it foundered in the 1970s but its journal adopted by Penn State University Press continued to be published as Shaw The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies until 2004. A second American organisation founded in 1951 as The Bernard Shaw Society remains active as of 2016. More recent societies have been established in Japan and India. Besides his collected music criticism Shaw has left a varied musical legacy not all of it of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre two of his plays were turned into musical comedies Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908 with music by Oscar Straus and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar Shaw turned down the composers request for an opera libretto but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgars Third Symphony and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite . The substance of Shaws political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaws erstwhile collaborator William Archer in a letter to the playwright wrote I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read heard seen and known as yourself who has produced so little effect on his generation. Margaret Cole who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked immensely hard at politics but essentially she surmises it was for funthe fun of a brilliant artist. After Shaws death Pearson wrote No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw. In its obituary tribute to Shaw The Times Literary Supplement concluded He was no originator of ideas. He was an insatiable adopter and adapter an incomparable prestidigitator with the thoughts of the forerunners. Nietzsche Samuel Butler Marx Shelley Blake Dickens William Morris Ruskin Beethoven and Wagner all had their applications and misapplications. By bending to their service all the faculties of a powerful mind by inextinguishable wit and by every artifice of argument he carried their thoughts as far as they would reachso far beyond their sources that they came to us with the vitality of the newly created.
Rudyard Kipling,Joseph Rudyard Kipling was an English novelist short-story writer poet and journalist. He was born in British India which inspired much of his work. Kiplings works of fiction include the Jungle Book duology Kim the Just So Stories and many short stories including The Man Who Would Be King . His poems include Mandalay Gunga Din The Gods of the Copybook Headings The White Mans Burden and If . He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story. His childrens books are classics; one critic noted a versatile and luminous narrative gift. Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdoms most popular writers.Henry James said Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius as distinct from fine intelligence that I have ever known. In 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature as the first English-language writer to receive the prize and at 41 its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood but declined both. Following his death in 1936 his ashes were interred at Poets Corner part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey. Kiplings subsequent reputation has changed with the political and social climate of the age. The contrasting views of him continued for much of the 20th century. Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes he is recognised as an incomparable if controversial interpreter of how empire was experienced. That and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts make him a force to be reckoned with. Rudyard Kipling was born on 30 December 1865 in Bombay in the Bombay Presidency of British India to Alice Kipling and John Lockwood Kipling. Alice was a vivacious woman of whom Lord Dufferin would say Dullness and Mrs Kipling cannot exist in the same room. John Lockwood Kipling a sculptor and pottery designer was the Principal and Professor of Architectural Sculpture at the newly founded Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in Bombay. John Lockwood and Alice met in 1863 and courted at Rudyard Lake in Rudyard Staffordshire England. They married and moved to India in 1865 after John Lockwood had accepted the position as Professor at the School of Art. They had been so moved by the beauty of the Rudyard Lake area that they named their first child after it Joseph Rudyard. Two of Alices sisters were married to artists Georgiana to the painter Edward Burne-Jones and her sister Agnes to Edward Poynter. A third sister Louisa was the mother of Kiplings most prominent relative his first cousin Stanley Baldwin who was Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times in the 1920s and 1930s. Kiplings birth home on the campus of the J. J. School of Art in Bombay was for many years used as the deans residence. Although a cottage bears a plaque noting it as his birth site the original one may have been torn down and replaced decades ago. Some historians and conservationists take the view that the bungalow marks a site merely close to the home of Kiplings birth as it was built in 1882 about 15 years after Kipling was born. Kipling seems to have said as much to the dean when visiting J. J. School in the 1930s. Mother of Cities to meFor I was born in her gateBetween the palms and the seaWhere the world-end steamers wait. According to Bernice M. Murphy Kiplings parents considered themselves Anglo-Indians and so too would their son though he spent the bulk of his life elsewhere. Complex issues of identity and national allegiance would become prominent in his fiction. Kipling referred to such conflicts. For example In the afternoon heats before we took our sleep she or Meeta would tell us stories and Indian nursery songs all unforgotten and we were sent into the dining-room after we had been dressed with the caution Speak English now to Papa and Mamma. So one spoke English haltingly translated out of the vernacular idiom that one thought and dreamed in. Kiplings days of strong light and darkness in Bombay ended when he was five. As was the custom in British India he and his three-year-old sister Alice were taken to the United Kingdom in their case to Southsea Portsmouth to live with a couple who boarded children of British nationals living abroad. For the next six years the children lived with the couple Captain Pryse Agar Holloway once an officer in the merchant navy and Sarah Holloway at their house Lorne Lodge 4 Campbell Road Southsea. Kipling referred to the place as the House of Desolation. In his autobiography published 65 years later Kipling recalled the stay with horror and wondered if the combination of cruelty and neglect that he experienced there at the hands of Mrs Holloway might not have hastened the onset of his literary life If you cross-examine a child of seven or eight on his days doings he will contradict himself very satisfactorily. If each contradiction be set down as a lie and retailed at breakfast life is not easy. I have known a certain amount of bullying but this was calculated torture religious as well as scientific. Yet it made me give attention to the lies I soon found it necessary to tell and this I presume is the foundation of literary effort. Trix fared better at Lorne Lodge; Mrs Holloway apparently hoped that Trix would eventually marry the Holloways son. The two Kipling children however had no relatives in England they could visit except that they spent a month each Christmas with a maternal aunt Georgiana and her husband Edward Burne-Jones at their house The Grange in Fulham London which Kipling called a paradise which I verily believe saved me. In the spring of 1877 Alice returned from India and removed the children from Lorne Lodge. Kipling remembers Often and often afterwards the beloved Aunt would ask me why I had never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also badly-treated children have a clear notion of what they are likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it. Alice took the children during spring 1877 to Goldings Farm at Loughton where a carefree summer and autumn was spent on the farm and adjoining Forest some of the time with Stanley Baldwin. In January 1878 Kipling was admitted to the United Services College at Westward Ho Devon a school recently founded to prepare boys for the army. It proved rough going for him at first but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories Stalky Co. . While there Kipling met and fell in love with Florence Garrard who was boarding with Trix at Southsea . Florence became the model for Maisie in Kiplings first novel The Light That Failed . Near the end of his schooling it was decided that Kipling did not have the academic ability to get into Oxford University on a scholarship. His parents lacked the wherewithal to finance him and so Kiplings father obtained a job for him in Lahore where the father served as Principal of the Mayo College of Art and Curator of the Lahore Museum. Kipling was to be assistant editor of a local newspaper the Civil and Military Gazette. He sailed for India on 20 September 1882 and arrived in Bombay on 18 October. He described the moment years later So at sixteen years and nine months but looking four or five years older and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding I found myself at Bombay where I was born moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them. This arrival changed Kipling as he explains There were yet three or four days rail to Lahore where my people lived. After these my English years fell away nor ever I think came back in full strength. From 1883 to 1889 Kipling worked in British India for local newspapers such as the Civil and Military Gazette in Lahore and The Pioneer in Allahabad. The former which was the newspaper Kipling was to call his mistress and most true love appeared six days a week throughout the year except for one-day breaks for Christmas and Easter. Stephen Wheeler the editor worked Kipling hard but Kiplings need to write was unstoppable. In 1886 he published his first collection of verse Departmental Ditties. That year also brought a change of editors at the newspaper; Kay Robinson the new editor allowed more creative freedom and Kipling was asked to contribute short stories to the newspaper. In an article printed in the Chums boys annual an ex-colleague of Kiplings stated that he never knew such a fellow for ink he simply revelled in it filling up his pen viciously and then throwing the contents all over the office so that it was almost dangerous to approach him. The anecdote continues In the hot weather when he wore only white trousers and a thin vest he is said to have resembled a Dalmatian dog more than a human being for he was spotted all over with ink in every direction. In the summer of 1883 Kipling visited Simla a well-known hill station and the summer capital of British India. By then it was the practice for the Viceroy of India and government to move to Simla for six months and the town became a centre of power as well as pleasure. Kiplings family became annual visitors to Simla and Lockwood Kipling was asked to serve in Christ Church there. Rudyard Kipling returned to Simla for his annual leave each year from 1885 to 1888 and the town featured prominently in many stories he wrote for the Gazette. My months leave at Simla or whatever Hill Station my people went to was pure joy every golden hour counted. It began in heat and discomfort by rail and road. It ended in the cool evening with a wood fire in ones bedroom and next morn thirty more of them ahead the early cup of tea the Mother who brought it in and the long talks of us all together again. One had leisure to work too at whatever play-work was in ones head and that was usually full. Back in Lahore 39 of his stories appeared in the Gazette between November 1886 and June 1887. Kipling included most of them in Plain Tales from the Hills his first prose collection published in Calcutta in January 1888 a month after his 22nd birthday. Kiplings time in Lahore however had come to an end. In November 1887 he was moved to the Gazettes larger sister newspaper The Pioneer in Allahabad in the United Provinces where he worked as assistant editor and lived in Belvedere House from 1888 to 1889. Kiplings writing continued at a frenetic pace. In 1888 he published six collections of short stories Soldiers Three The Story of the Gadsbys In Black and White Under the Deodars The Phantom Rickshaw and Wee Willie Winkie. These contain a total of 41 stories some quite long. In addition as The Pioneers special correspondent in the western region of Rajputana he wrote many sketches that were later collected in Letters of Marque and published in From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches Letters of Travel. Kipling was discharged from The Pioneer in early 1889 after a dispute. By this time he had been increasingly thinking of his future. He sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for 200 and a small royalty and the Plain Tales for 50; in addition he received six-months salary from The Pioneer in lieu of notice. Kipling decided to use the money to move to London the literary centre of the British Empire. On 9 March 1889 he left India travelling first to San Francisco via Rangoon Singapore Hong Kong and Japan. Kipling was favourably impressed by Japan calling its people and ways gracious folk and fair manners. The Nobel Prize committee cited Kiplings writing on the manners and customs of the Japanese when they awarded his Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907. Kipling later wrote that he had lost his heart to a geisha whom he called O-Toyo writing while in the United States during the same trip across the Pacific I had left the innocent East far behind.... Weeping softly for O-Toyo.... O-Toyo was a darling. Kipling then travelled through the United States writing articles for The Pioneer that were later published in From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches Letters of Travel. Starting his North American travels in San Francisco Kipling went north to Portland Oregon then Seattle Washington up to Victoria and Vancouver British Columbia through Medicine Hat Alberta back into the US to Yellowstone National Park down to Salt Lake City then east to Omaha Nebraska and on to Chicago then to Beaver Pennsylvania on the Ohio River to visit the Hill family. From there he went to Chautauqua with Professor Hill and later to Niagara Falls Toronto Washington D.C. New York and Boston. In the course of this journey he met Mark Twain in Elmira New York and was deeply impressed. Kipling arrived unannounced at Twains home and later wrote that as he rang the doorbell It occurred to me for the first time that Mark Twain might possibly have other engagements other than the entertainment of escaped lunatics from India be they ever so full of admiration. As it was Twain gladly welcomed Kipling and had a two-hour conversation with him on trends in Anglo-American literature and about what Twain was going to write in a sequel to Tom Sawyer with Twain assuring Kipling that a sequel was coming although he had not decided upon the ending either Sawyer would be elected to Congress or he would be hanged. Twain also passed along the literary advice that an author should get your facts first and then you can distort em as much as you please. Twain who rather liked Kipling later wrote of their meeting Between us we cover all knowledge; he covers all that can be known and I cover the rest. Kipling then crossed the Atlantic to Liverpool in October 1889. He soon made his début in the London literary world to great acclaim. In London Kipling had several stories accepted by magazines. He found a place to live for the next two years at Villiers Street near Charing Cross  Meantime I had found me quarters in Villiers Street Strand which forty-six years ago was primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small not over-clean or well-kept but from my desk I could look out of my window through the fanlight of Gattis Music-Hall entrance across the street almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side the boom of the Strand on the other while before my windows Father Thames under the Shot tower walked up and down with his traffic. In the next two years he published a novel The Light That Failed had a nervous breakdown and met an American writer and publishing agent Wolcott Balestier with whom he collaborated on a novel The Naulahka . In 1891 as advised by his doctors Kipling took another sea voyage to South Africa Australia New Zealand and once again India. He cut short his plans to spend Christmas with his family in India when he heard of Balestiers sudden death from typhoid fever and decided to return to London immediately. Before his return he had used the telegram to propose to and be accepted by Wolcotts sister Caroline Starr Balestier called Carrie whom he had met a year earlier and with whom he had apparently been having an intermittent romance. Meanwhile late in 1891 a collection of his short stories on the British in India Lifes Handicap was published in London. On 18 January 1892 Carrie Balestier and Rudyard Kipling married in London in the thick of an influenza epidemic when the undertakers had run out of black horses and the dead had to be content with brown ones. The wedding was held at All Souls Church in Langham Place central London. Henry James gave away the bride. Kipling and his wife settled upon a honeymoon that took them first to the United States and then to Japan. On arriving in Yokohama they discovered that their bank The New Oriental Banking Corporation had failed. Taking this loss in their stride they returned to the U.S. back to Vermont Carrie by this time was pregnant with their first child and rented a small cottage on a farm near Brattleboro for 10 a month. According to Kipling We furnished it with a simplicity that fore-ran the hire-purchase system. We bought second or third hand a huge hot-air stove which we installed in the cellar. We cut generous holes in our thin floors for its eight-inch tin pipes and we were extraordinarily and self-centredly content. In this house which they called Bliss Cottage their first child Josephine was born in three-foot of snow on the night of 29th December 1892. Her Mothers birthday being the 31st and mine the 30th of the same month we congratulated her on her sense of the fitness of things... It was also in this cottage that the first dawnings of The Jungle Books came to Kipling The workroom in the Bliss Cottage was seven feet by eight and from December to April the snow lay level with its window-sill. It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness and suspense of the winter of 92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhoods magazine and a phrase in Haggards Nada the Lily combined with the echo of this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head the pen took charge and I watched it begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals which later grew into the two Jungle Books. With Josephines arrival Bliss Cottage was felt to be congested so eventually the couple bought land 10 acres on a rocky hillside overlooking the Connecticut River from Carries brother Beatty Balestier and built their own house. Kipling named this Naulakha in honour of Wolcott and of their collaboration and this time the name was spelt correctly. From his early years in Lahore Kipling had become enamoured with the Mughal architecture especially the Naulakha pavilion situated in Lahore Fort which eventually inspired the title of his novel as well as the house. The house still stands on Kipling Road three miles north of Brattleboro in Dummerston Vermont a big secluded dark-green house with shingled roof and sides which Kipling called his ship and which brought him sunshine and a mind at ease. His seclusion in Vermont combined with his healthy sane clean life made Kipling both inventive and prolific. In a mere four years he produced along with the Jungle Books a book of short stories a novel and a profusion of poetry including the volume The Seven Seas. The collection of Barrack-Room Ballads was issued in March 1892 first published individually for the most part in 1890 and contained his poems Mandalay and Gunga Din. He especially enjoyed writing the Jungle Books and also corresponding with many children who wrote to him about them. The writing life in Naulakha was occasionally interrupted by visitors including his father who visited soon after his retirement in 1893 and the British writer Arthur Conan Doyle who brought his golf clubs stayed for two days and gave Kipling an extended golf lesson. Kipling seemed to take to golf occasionally practising with the local Congregational minister and even playing with red-painted balls when the ground was covered in snow. However winter golf was not altogether a success because there were no limits to a drive; the ball might skid two miles down the long slope to Connecticut river. Kipling loved the outdoors not least of whose marvels in Vermont was the turning of the leaves each fall. He described this moment in a letter A little maple began it flaming blood-red of a sudden where he stood against the dark green of a pine-belt. Next morning there was an answering signal from the swamp where the sumacs grow. Three days later the hill-sides as fast as the eye could range were afire and the roads paved with crimson and gold. Then a wet wind blew and ruined all the uniforms of that gorgeous army; and the oaks who had held themselves in reserve buckled on their dull and bronzed cuirasses and stood it out stiffly to the last blown leaf till nothing remained but pencil-shadings of bare boughs and one could see into the most private heart of the woods. In February 1896 Elsie Kipling was born the couples second daughter. By this time according to several biographers their marital relationship was no longer light-hearted and spontaneous. Although they would always remain loyal to each other they seemed now to have fallen into set roles. In a letter to a friend who had become engaged around this time the 30yearold Kipling offered this sombre counsel marriage principally taught the tougher virtues such as humility restraint order and forethought. Later in the same year he temporarily taught at Bishops College School in Quebec Canada. The Kiplings loved life in Vermont and might have lived out their lives there were it not for two incidents one of global politics the other of family discord. By the early 1890s the United Kingdom and Venezuela were in a border dispute involving British Guiana. The U.S. had made several offers to arbitrate but in 1895 the new American Secretary of State Richard Olney upped the ante by arguing for the American right to arbitrate on grounds of sovereignty on the continent . This raised hackles in Britain and the situation grew into a major Anglo-American crisis with talk of war on both sides. Although the crisis eased into greater United StatesBritish co-operation Kipling was bewildered by what he felt was persistent anti-British sentiment in the U.S. especially in the press. He wrote in a letter that it felt like being aimed at with a decanter across a friendly dinner table. By January 1896 he had decided to end his familys good wholesome life in the U.S. and seek their fortunes elsewhere. A family dispute became the final straw. For some time relations between Carrie and her brother Beatty Balestier had been strained owing to his drinking and insolvency. In May 1896 an inebriated Beatty encountered Kipling on the street and threatened him with physical harm. The incident led to Beattys eventual arrest but in the subsequent hearing and the resulting publicity Kiplings privacy was destroyed and he was left feeling miserable and exhausted. In July 1896 a week before the hearing was to resume the Kiplings packed their belongings left the United States and returned to England. By September 1896 the Kiplings were in Torquay Devon on the south-western coast of England in a hillside home overlooking the English Channel. Although Kipling did not much care for his new house whose design he claimed left its occupants feeling dispirited and gloomy he managed to remain productive and socially active. Kipling was now a famous man and in the previous two or three years had increasingly been making political pronouncements in his writings. The Kiplings had welcomed their first son John in August 1897. Kipling had begun work on two poems Recessional and The White Mans Burden which were to create controversy when published. Regarded by some as anthems for enlightened and duty-bound empire-building the poems were seen by others as propaganda for brazen-faced imperialism and its attendant racial attitudes; still others saw irony in the poems and warnings of the perils of empire. Take up the White Mans burdenSend forth the best ye breedGo bind your sons to exileTo serve your captives need;To wait in heavy harnessOn fluttered folk and wildYour new-caught sullen peoplesHalf devil and half child.The White Mans Burden There was also foreboding in the poems a sense that all could yet come to naught. Far-called our navies melt away;On dune and headland sinks the fireLo all our pomp of yesterdayIs one with Nineveh and TyreJudge of the Nations spare us yet.Lest we forget lest we forgetRecessional A prolific writer during his time in Torquay he also wrote Stalky Co. a collection of school stories whose juvenile protagonists display a know-it-all cynical outlook on patriotism and authority. According to his family Kipling enjoyed reading aloud stories from Stalky Co. to them and often went into spasms of laughter over his own jokes. In early 1898 the Kiplings travelled to South Africa for their winter holiday so beginning an annual tradition which would last until 1908. They would stay in The Woolsack a house on Cecil Rhodess estate at Groote Schuur within walking distance of Rhodes mansion. With his new reputation as Poet of the Empire Kipling was warmly received by some of the influential politicians of the Cape Colony including Rhodes Sir Alfred Milner and Leander Starr Jameson. Kipling cultivated their friendship and came to admire the men and their politics. The period 18981910 was crucial in the history of South Africa and included the Second Boer War the ensuing peace treaty and the 1910 formation of the Union of South Africa. Back in England Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War and on his next visit to South Africa in early 1900 became a correspondent for The Friend newspaper in Bloemfontein which had been commandeered by Lord Roberts for British troops. Although his journalistic stint was to last only two weeks it was Kiplings first work on a newspaper staff since he left The Pioneer in Allahabad more than ten years before. At The Friend he made lifelong friendships with Perceval Landon H. A. Gwynne and others. He also wrote articles published more widely expressing his views on the conflict. Kipling penned an inscription for the Honoured Dead Memorial in Kimberley. In 1897 Kipling moved from Torquay to Rottingdean near Brighton East Sussex first to North End House and then to the Elms. In 1902 Kipling bought Batemans a house built in 1634 and located in rural Burwash. Batemans was Kiplings home from 1902 until his death in 1936. The house and its surrounding buildings the mill and 33 acres were bought for 9300. It had no bathroom no running water upstairs and no electricity but Kipling loved it Behold us lawful owners of a grey stone lichened house A.D. 1634 over the door beamed panelled with old oak staircase and all untouched and unfaked. It is a good and peaceable place. We have loved it ever since our first sight of it . In the non-fiction realm he became involved in the debate over the British response to the rise in German naval power known as the Tirpitz Plan to build a fleet to challenge the Royal Navy publishing a series of articles in 1898 collected as A Fleet in Being. On a visit to the United States in 1899 Kipling and his daughter Josephine developed pneumonia from which she eventually died. In the wake of his daughters death Kipling concentrated on collecting material for what became Just So Stories for Little Children published in 1902 the year after Kim. The American art historian Janice Leoshko and the American literary scholar David Scott have argued that Kim disproves the claim by Edward Said that Kipling was a promoter of Orientalism since Kipling who was deeply interested in Buddhism presented Tibetan Buddhism in a fairly sympathetic light and aspects of the novel appeared to reflect a Buddhist understanding of the universe. Kipling was offended by the German Emperor Wilhelm IIs Hun speech in 1900 urging German troops being sent to China to crush the Boxer Rebellion to behave like Huns and take no prisoners. In a 1902 poem The Rowers Kipling attacked the Kaiser as a threat to Britain and made the first use of the term Hun as an anti-German insult using Wilhelms own words and the actions of German troops in China to portray Germans as essentially barbarian. In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro the Francophile Kipling called Germany a menace and called for an Anglo-French alliance to stop it. In another letter at the same time Kipling described the unfrei peoples of Central Europe as living in the Middle Ages with machine guns. Kipling wrote a number of speculative fiction short stories including The Army of a Dream in which he sought to show a more efficient and responsible army than the hereditary bureaucracy of England at the time and two science fiction stories With the Night Mail and As Easy As A.B.C. . Both were set in the 21st century in Kiplings Aerial Board of Control universe. They read like modern hard science fiction and introduced the literary technique known as indirect exposition which would later become one of science fiction writer Robert Heinleins hallmarks. This technique is one that Kipling picked up in India and used to solve the problem of his English readers not understanding much about Indian society when writing The Jungle Book. In 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature having been nominated in that year by Charles Oman professor at the University of Oxford. The prize citation said it was in consideration of the power of observation originality of imagination virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author. Nobel prizes had been established in 1901 and Kipling was the first English-language recipient. At the award ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December 1907 the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy Carl David af Wirsén praised both Kipling and three centuries of English literature The Swedish Academy in awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature this year to Rudyard Kipling desires to pay a tribute of homage to the literature of England so rich in manifold glories and to the greatest genius in the realm of narrative that that country has produced in our times. To book-end this achievement came the publication of two connected poetry and story collections Puck of Pooks Hill and Rewards and Fairies . The latter contained the poem If. In a 1995 BBC opinion poll it was voted the UKs favourite poem. This exhortation to self-control and stoicism is arguably Kiplings most famous poem. Such was Kiplings popularity that he was asked by his friend Max Aitken to intervene in the 1911 Canadian election on behalf of the Conservatives. In 1911 the major issue in Canada was a reciprocity treaty with the United States signed by the Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and vigorously opposed by the Conservatives under Sir Robert Borden. On 7 September 1911 the Montreal Daily Star newspaper published a front-page appeal against the agreement by Kipling who wrote It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial legal financial social and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States. At the time the Montreal Daily Star was Canadas most read newspaper. Over the next week Kiplings appeal was reprinted in every English newspaper in Canada and is credited with helping to turn Canadian public opinion against the Liberal government. Kipling sympathised with the anti-Home Rule stance of Irish Unionists who opposed Irish autonomy. He was friends with Edward Carson the Dublin-born leader of Ulster Unionism who raised the Ulster Volunteers to prevent Home Rule in Ireland. Kipling wrote in a letter to a friend that Ireland was not a nation and that before the English arrived in 1169 the Irish were a gang of cattle thieves living in savagery and killing each other while writing dreary poems about it all. In his view it was only British rule that allowed Ireland to advance. A visit to Ireland in 1911 confirmed Kiplings prejudices. He wrote that the Irish countryside was beautiful but spoiled by what he called the ugly homes of Irish farmers with Kipling adding that God had made the Irish into poets having deprived them of love of line or knowledge of colour. In contrast Kipling had nothing but praise for the decent folk of the Protestant minority and Unionist Ulster free from the threat of constant mob violence. Kipling wrote the poem Ulster in 1912 reflecting his Unionist politics. Kipling often referred to the Irish Unionists as our party. Kipling had no sympathy or understanding for Irish nationalism seeing Home Rule as an act of treason by the government of the Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that would plunge Ireland into the Dark Ages and allow the Irish Catholic majority to oppress the Protestant minority. The scholar David Gilmour wrote that Kiplings lack of understanding of Ireland could be seen in his attack on John Redmond the Anglophile leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party who wanted Home Rule because he believed it was the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together as a traitor working to break up the United Kingdom.Ulster was first publicly read at an Unionist rally in Belfast where the largest Union Jack ever made was unfolded. Kipling admitted it was meant to strike a hard blow against the Asquith governments Home Rule bill Rebellion rapine hate Oppression wrong and greed Are loosed to rule our fate By Englands act and deed.Ulster generated much controversy with the Conservative MP Sir Mark Sykes who as a Unionist was opposed to the Home Rule bill condemning Ulster in The Morning Post as a direct appeal to ignorance and a deliberate attempt to foster religious hate. Kipling was a staunch opponent of Bolshevism a position which he shared with his friend Henry Rider Haggard. The two had bonded on Kiplings arrival in London in 1889 largely due to their shared opinions and remained lifelong friends. According to the English magazine Masonic Illustrated Kipling became a Freemason in about 1885 before the usual minimum age of 21 being initiated into Hope and Perseverance Lodge No. 782 in Lahore. He later wrote to The Times I was Secretary for some years of the Lodge... which included Brethren of at least four creeds. I was entered by an Englishman. Our Tyler was an Indian Jew. Kipling received not only the three degrees of Craft Masonry but also the side degrees of Mark Master Mason and Royal Ark Mariner. Kipling so loved his Masonic experience that he memorialised its ideals in his poem The Mother Lodge and used the fraternity and its symbols as vital plot devices in his novella The Man Who Would Be King. At the beginning of the First World War like many other writers Kipling wrote pamphlets and poems enthusiastically supporting the UK war aims of restoring Belgium after it had been occupied by Germany together with generalised statements that Britain was standing up for the cause of good. In September 1914 Kipling was asked by the government to write propaganda an offer that he accepted. Kiplings pamphlets and stories were popular with the British people during the war his major themes being to glorify the British military as the place for heroic men to be while citing German atrocities against Belgian civilians and the stories of women brutalised by a horrific war unleashed by Germany yet surviving and triumphing in spite of their suffering. Kipling was enraged by reports of the Rape of Belgium together with the sinking of the RMSLusitania in 1915 which he saw as a deeply inhumane act which led him to see the war as a crusade for civilisation against barbarism. In a 1915 speech Kipling declared There was no crime no cruelty no abomination that the mind of men can conceive of which the German has not perpetrated is not perpetrating and will not perpetrate if he is allowed to go on... Today there are only two divisions in the world... human beings and Germans. Alongside his passionate antipathy towards Germany Kipling was privately deeply critical of how the war was being fought by the British Army complaining as early as October 1914 that Germany should have been defeated by now and something must be wrong with the British Army. Kipling who was shocked by the heavy losses that the British Expeditionary Force had taken by the autumn of 1914 blamed the entire pre-war generation of British politicians who he argued had failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War. Thus thousands of British soldiers were now paying with their lives for their failure in the fields of France and Belgium. Kipling had scorn for men who shirked duty in the First World War. In The New Army in Training Kipling concluded by saying This much we can realise even though we are so close to it the old safe instinct saves us from triumph and exultation. But what will be the position in years to come of the young man who has deliberately elected to outcaste himself from this all-embracing brotherhood What of his family and above all what of his descendants when the books have been closed and the last balance struck of sacrifice and sorrow in every hamlet village parish suburb city shire district province and Dominion throughout the Empire In 1914 Kipling was one of 53 leading British authors a number that included H. G. Wells Arthur Conan Doyle and Thomas Hardy who signed their names to the Authors Declaration. This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime and that Britain could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war. Kiplings son John was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in September 1915 at age 18. John initially wanted to join the Royal Navy but having had his application turned down after a failed medical examination due to poor eyesight he opted to apply for military service as an army officer. Again his eyesight was an issue during the medical examination. In fact he tried twice to enlist but was rejected. His father had been lifelong friends with Lord Roberts former commander-in-chief of the British Army and colonel of the Irish Guards and at Rudyards request John was accepted into the Irish Guards. John Kipling was sent to Loos two days into the battle in a reinforcement contingent. He was last seen stumbling through the mud blindly with a possible facial injury. A body identified as his was found in 1992 although that identification has been challenged. In 2015 the Commonwealth War Grave Commission confirmed that it had correctly identified the burial place of John Kipling; they record his date of death as 27 September 1915 and that he is buried at St Marys A.D.S. Cemetery Haisnes. After his sons death in a poem titled Epitaphs of the War Kipling wrote If any question why we died Tell them because our fathers lied. Critics have speculated that these words may express Kiplings guilt over his role in arranging Johns commission. Professor Tracy Bilsing contends that the line refers to Kiplings disgust that British leaders failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War and were unprepared for the struggle with Germany in 1914 with the lie of the fathers being that the British Army was prepared for any war when it was not. Johns death has been linked to Kiplings 1916 poem My Boy Jack notably in the play My Boy Jack and its subsequent television adaptation along with the documentary Rudyard Kipling A Remembrance Tale. However the poem was originally published at the head of a story about the Battle of Jutland and appears to refer to a death at sea; the Jack referred to may be to the boy VC Jack Cornwell or perhaps a generic Jack Tar. In the Kipling family Jack was the name of the family dog while John Kipling was always John making the identification of the protagonist of My Boy Jack with John Kipling somewhat questionable. However Kipling was indeed emotionally devastated by the death of his son. He is said to have assuaged his grief by reading the novels of Jane Austen aloud to his wife and daughter. During the war he wrote a booklet The Fringes of the Fleet containing essays and poems on various nautical subjects of the war. Some of these were set to music by the English composer Edward Elgar. Kipling became friends with a French soldier named Maurice Hammoneau whose life had been saved in the First World War when his copy of Kim which he had in his left breast pocket stopped a bullet. Hammoneau presented Kipling with the book with bullet still embedded and his Croix de Guerre as a token of gratitude. They continued to correspond and when Hammoneau had a son Kipling insisted on returning the book and medal. On 1 August 1918 the poem The Old Volunteer appeared under his name in The Times. The next day he wrote to the newspaper to disclaim authorship and a correction appeared. Although The Times employed a private detective to investigate the detective appears to have suspected Kipling himself of being the author and the identity of the hoaxer was never established. Partly in response to Johns death Kipling joined Sir Fabian Wares Imperial War Graves Commission the group responsible for the garden-like British war graves that can be found to this day dotted along the former Western Front and the other places in the world where British Empire troops lie buried. His main contributions to the project were his selection of the biblical phrase Their Name Liveth For Evermore found on the Stones of Remembrance in larger war cemeteries and his suggestion of the phrase Known unto God for the gravestones of unidentified servicemen. He also chose the inscription The Glorious Dead on the Cenotaph Whitehall London. Additionally he wrote a two-volume history of the Irish Guards his sons regiment published in 1923 and seen as one of the finest examples of regimental history. Kiplings short story The Gardener depicts visits to the war cemeteries and the poem The Kings Pilgrimage a journey which King George V made touring the cemeteries and memorials under construction by the Imperial War Graves Commission. With the increasing popularity of the automobile Kipling became a motoring correspondent for the British press writing enthusiastically of trips around England and abroad though he was usually driven by a chauffeur. After the war Kipling was sceptical of the Fourteen Points and the League of Nations but had hopes that the United States would abandon isolationism and the post-war world be dominated by an Anglo-French-American alliance. He hoped the United States would take on a League of Nations mandate for Armenia as the best way of preventing isolationism and hoped that Theodore Roosevelt whom Kipling admired would again become president. Kipling was saddened by Roosevelts death in 1919 believing him to be the only American politician capable of keeping the United States in the game of world politics. Kipling was hostile towards communism writing of the Bolshevik take-over in 1917 that one sixth of the world had passed bodily out of civilization. In a 1918 poem Kipling wrote of Soviet Russia that everything good in Russia had been destroyed by the Bolsheviks all that was left was the sound of weeping and the sight of burning fire and the shadow of a people trampled into the mire. In 1920 Kipling co-founded the Liberty League with Haggard and Lord Sydenham. This short-lived enterprise focused on promoting classic liberal ideals as a response to the rising power of communist tendencies within Great Britain or as Kipling put it to combat the advance of Bolshevism. In 1922 Kipling having referred to the work of engineers in some of his poems such as The Sons of Martha Sappers and McAndrews Hymn and in other writings including short-story anthologies such as The Days Work was asked by a University of Toronto civil engineering professor Herbert E. T. Haultain for assistance in developing a dignified obligation and ceremony for graduating engineering students. Kipling was enthusiastic in his response and shortly produced both formally titled The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer. Today engineering graduates all across Canada are presented with an iron ring at a ceremony to remind them of their obligation to society. In 1922 Kipling became Lord Rector of St Andrews University in Scotland a three-year position. Kipling as a Francophile argued strongly for an Anglo-French alliance to uphold the peace calling Britain and France in 1920 the twin fortresses of European civilization. Similarly Kipling repeatedly warned against revising the Treaty of Versailles in Germanys favour which he predicted would lead to a new world war. An admirer of Raymond Poincaré Kipling was one of few British intellectuals who supported the French Occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 at a time when the British government and most public opinion was against the French position. In contrast to the popular British view of Poincaré as a cruel bully intent on impoverishing Germany with unreasonable reparations Kipling argued that he was rightfully trying to preserve France as a great power in the face of an unfavourable situation. Kipling argued that even before 1914 Germanys larger economy and higher birth rate had made that country stronger than France; with much of France devastated by war and the French suffering heavy losses meant that its low birth rate would give it trouble while Germany was mostly undamaged and still with a higher birth rate. So he reasoned that the future would bring German domination if Versailles were revised in Germanys favour and it was madness for Britain to press France to do so. In 1924 Kipling was opposed to the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald as Bolshevism without bullets. He believed that Labour was a communist front organisation and excited orders and instructions from Moscow would expose Labour as such to the British people. Kiplings views were on the right. Though he admired Benito Mussolini to some extent in the 1920s he was against fascism calling Oswald Mosley a bounder and an arriviste. By 1935 he was calling Mussolini a deranged and dangerous egomaniac and in 1933 wrote The Hitlerites are out for blood. Despite his anti-communism Kipling was popular with Russian readers in the interwar period. Many younger Russian poets and writers such as Konstantin Simonov were influenced by him. Kiplings clarity of style use of colloquial language and employment of rhythm and rhyme were seen as major innovations in poetry that appealed to many younger Russian poets.Though it was obligatory for Soviet journals to begin translations of Kipling with an attack on him as a fascist and an imperialist such was Kiplings popularity with Russian readers that his works were not banned in the Soviet Union until 1939 with the signing of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact. The ban was lifted in 1941 after Operation Barbarossa when Britain become a Soviet ally but imposed again with the Cold War in 1946. Many older editions of Rudyard Kiplings books have a swastika printed on the cover associated with a picture of an elephant carrying a lotus flower reflecting the influence of Indian culture. Kiplings use of the swastika was based on the Indian sun symbol conferring good luck and the Sanskrit word meaning fortunate or well-being. He used the swastika symbol in both right and left-facing forms and it was in general use by others at the time. In a note to Edward Bok after the death of Lockwood Kipling in 1911 Rudyard said I am sending with this for your acceptance as some little memory of my father to whom you were so kind the original of one of the plaques that he used to make for me. I thought it being the Swastika would be appropriate for your Swastika. May it bring you even more good fortune. Once the swastika had become widely associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis Kipling ordered that it should no longer adorn his books. Less than a year before his death Kipling gave a speech to the Royal Society of St George on 6 May 1935 warning of the danger which Nazi Germany posed to Britain. Kipling scripted the first Royal Christmas Message delivered via the BBCs Empire Service by George V in 1932. In 1934 he published a short story in The Strand Magazine Proofs of Holy Writ postulating that William Shakespeare had helped to polish the prose of the King James Bible. Kipling kept writing until the early 1930s but at a slower pace and with less success than before. On the night of 12 January 1936 he suffered a haemorrhage in his small intestine. He underwent surgery but died at Middlesex Hospital in London less than a week later on 18 January 1936 at the age of 70 of a perforated duodenal ulcer. Kiplings body lay in state in the Fitzrovia Chapel part of Middlesex Hospital after his death and is commemorated with a plaque near the altar. His death had previously been incorrectly announced in a magazine to which he wrote Ive just read that I am dead. Dont forget to delete me from your list of subscribers. The pallbearers at the funeral included Kiplings cousin Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and the marble casket was covered by a Union Jack. Kipling was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in north-west London and his ashes interred at Poets Corner part of the south transept of Westminster Abbey next to the graves of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy. Kiplings will was proven on 6 April with his estate valued at 168141 2s. 11d. . In 2002 Kiplings Just So Stories featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the centenary of the publication of the book. In 2010 the International Astronomical Union approved the naming of a crater on the planet Mercury after Kipling one of ten newly discovered impact craters observed by the MESSENGER spacecraft in 20082009. In 2012 an extinct species of crocodile Goniopholis kiplingi was named in his honour in recognition for his enthusiasm for natural sciences. More than 50 unpublished poems by Kipling discovered by the American scholar Thomas Pinney were released for the first time in March 2013. Kiplings writing has strongly influenced that of others. His stories for adults remain in print and have garnered high praise from writers as different as Poul Anderson Jorge Luis Borges and Randall Jarrell who wrote After you have read Kiplings fifty or seventy-five best stories you realize that few men have written this many stories of this much merit and that very few have written more and better stories. His childrens stories remain popular and his Jungle Books made into several films. The first was made by producer Alexander Korda. Other films have been produced by The Walt Disney Company. A number of his poems were set to music by Percy Grainger. A series of short films based on some of his stories was broadcast by the BBC in 1964. Kiplings work is still popular today. The poet T. S. Eliot edited A Choice of Kiplings Verse with an introductory essay. Eliot was aware of the complaints that had been levelled against Kipling and he dismissed them one by one that Kipling is a Tory using his verse to transmit right wing political views or a journalist pandering to popular taste; while Eliot writes I cannot find any justification for the charge that he held a doctrine of race superiority. Eliot finds instead An immense gift for using words an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses the mask of the entertainer and beyond that a queer gift of second sight of transmitting messages from elsewhere a gift so disconcerting when we are made aware of it that thenceforth we are never sure when it is not present all this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle. Of Kiplings verse such as his Barrack-Room Ballads Eliot writes of a number of poets who have written great poetry only... a very few whom I should call great verse writers. And unless I am mistaken Kiplings position in this class is not only high but unique. In response to Eliot George Orwell wrote a long consideration of Kiplings work for Horizon in 1942 noting that although as a jingo imperialist Kipling was morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting his work had many qualities which ensured that while every enlightened person has despised him... nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still there. One reason for Kiplings power his sense of responsibility which made it possible for him to have a world-view even though it happened to be a false one. Although he had no direct connexion with any political party Kipling was a Conservative a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition. In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality. The ruling power is always faced with the question In such and such circumstances what would you do whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions. Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition as in England the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover anyone who starts out with a pessimistic reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events for Utopia never arrives and the gods of the copybook headings as Kipling himself put it always return. Kipling sold out to the British governing class not financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement for the British ruling class were not what he imagined and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty not daring has no wish to épater les bourgeois. He dealt largely in platitudes and since we live in a world of platitudes much of what he said sticks. Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the enlightened utterances of the same period such as Wildes epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of Man and Superman. In 1939 the poet W. H. Auden celebrated Kipling in a similarly ambiguous way in his elegy for William Butler Yeats. Auden deleted this section from more recent editions of his poems. Time that is intolerantOf the brave and innocentAnd indifferent in a weekTo a beautiful physiqueWorships language and forgivesEveryone by whom it lives;Pardons cowardice conceitLays its honours at his feet.Time that with this strange excusePardons Kipling and his viewsAnd will pardon Paul ClaudelPardons him for writing well. The poet Alison Brackenbury writes Kipling is poetrys Dickens an outsider and journalist with an unrivalled ear for sound and speech. The English folk singer Peter Bellamy was a lover of Kiplings poetry much of which he believed to have been influenced by English traditional folk forms. He recorded several albums of Kiplings verse set to traditional airs or to tunes of his own composition written in traditional style. However in the case of the bawdy folk song The Bastard King of England which is commonly credited to Kipling it is believed that the song is actually misattributed. Kipling often is quoted in discussions of contemporary British political and social issues. In 1911 Kipling wrote the poem The Reeds of Runnymede that celebrated the Magna Carta and summoned up a vision of the stubborn Englishry determined to defend their rights. In 1996 the following verses of the poem were quoted by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warning against the encroachment of the European Union on national sovereignty At Runnymede at RunnymedeOh hear the reeds at RunnymedeYou musnt sell delay denyA freemans right or liberty.It wakes the stubborn EnglishryWe saw em roused at Runnymede... And still when Mob or Monarch laysToo rude a hand on English waysThe whisper wakes the shudder playsAcross the reeds at Runnymede.And Thames that knows the mood of kingsAnd crowds and priests and suchlike thingsRolls deep and dreadful as he bringsTheir warning down from Runnymede Political singer-songwriter Billy Bragg who attempts to build a left-wing English nationalism in contrast with the more common right-wing English nationalism has attempted to reclaim Kipling for an inclusive sense of Englishness. Kiplings enduring relevance has been noted in the United States as it has become involved in Afghanistan and other areas about which he wrote. In 1903 Kipling gave permission to Elizabeth Ford Holt to borrow themes from the Jungle Books to establish Camp Mowglis a summer camp for boys on the shores of Newfound Lake in New Hampshire. Throughout their lives Kipling and his wife Carrie maintained an active interest in Camp Mowglis which still continues the traditions that Kipling inspired. Buildings at Mowglis have names such as Akela Toomai Baloo and Panther. The campers are referred to as the Pack from the youngest Cubs to the oldest living in Den. Kiplings links with the Scouting movements were also strong. Robert Baden-Powell founder of Scouting used many themes from Jungle Book stories and Kim in setting up his junior Wolf Cubs. These ties still exist such as the popularity of Kims Game. The movement is named after Mowglis adopted wolf family and adult helpers of Wolf Cub Packs take names from The Jungle Book especially the adult leader called Akela after the leader of the Seeonee wolf pack. After the death of Kiplings wife in 1939 his house Batemans in Burwash East Sussex where he had lived from 1902 until 1936 was bequeathed to the National Trust. It is now a public museum dedicated to the author. Elsie Bambridge his only child who lived to maturity died childless in 1976 and bequeathed her copyrights to the National Trust which in turn donated them to the University of Sussex to ensure better public access. Novelist and poet Sir Kingsley Amis wrote a poem Kipling at Batemans after visiting Burwash as part of a BBC television series on writers and their houses. In 2003 actor Ralph Fiennes read excerpts from Kiplings works from the study in Batemans including The Jungle Book Something of Myself Kim and The Just So Stories and poems including If ... and My Boy Jack for a CD published by the National Trust. In modern-day India whence he drew much of his material Kiplings reputation remains controversial especially among modern nationalists and some post-colonial critics. It has long been alleged that Rudyard Kipling was a prominent supporter of Colonel Reginald Dyer who was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar and that Kipling called Dyer the man who saved India and initiated collections for the latters homecoming prize. Kim Wagner senior lecturer in British Imperial History at Queen Mary University of London says that while Kipling did make a 10 donation he never made that remark. Similarly author Derek Sayer states that Dyer was widely lauded as the saviour of Punjab that Kipling had no part in organizing The Morning Post fund and that Kipling only sent 10 making the laconic observation He did his duty as he saw it. Subhash Chopra also writes in his book Kipling Sahib the Raj Patriot that the benefit fund was started by The Morning Post newspaper not by Kipling.The Economic Times attributes the phrase The Man Who Saved India along with the Dyer benefit fund to The Morning Post as well. Many contemporary Indian intellectuals such as Ashis Nandy have a nuanced view of Kiplings legacy. Jawaharlal Nehru the first prime minister of independent India often described Kiplings novel Kim as one of his favourite books. G. V. Desani an Indian writer of fiction had a more negative opinion of Kipling. He alludes to Kipling in his novel All About H. Hatterr I happen to pick up R. Kiplings autobiographical Kim.Therein this self-appointed whitemans burden-bearing sherpa fellers stated how in the Orient blokes hit the road and think nothing of walking a thousand miles in search of something. Indian writer Khushwant Singh wrote in 2001 that he considers Kiplings If the essence of the message of The Gita in English referring to the Bhagavad Gita an ancient Indian scripture. Indian writer R. K. Narayan said Kipling the supposed expert writer on India showed a better understanding of the mind of the animals in the jungle than of the men in an Indian home or the marketplace. The Indian politician and writer Shashi Tharoor commented Kipling that flatulent voice of Victorian imperialism would wax eloquent on the noble duty to bring law to those without it. In November 2007 it was announced that Kiplings birth home in the campus of the J. J. School of Art in Bombay would be turned into a museum celebrating the author and his works. Though best known as an author Kipling was also an accomplished artist. Influenced by Aubrey Beardsley Kipling produced many illustrations for his stories e.g. Just So Stories 1919. Kiplings bibliography includes fiction non-fiction and poetry. Several of his works were collaborations.
Joseph Conrad,Joseph Conrad was a Polish-British novelist and short story writer. He is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language; though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties he came to be regarded a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature. He wrote novels and stories many in nautical settings that depict crises of human individuality in the midst of what he saw as an indifferent inscrutable and amoral world. Conrad is considered a literary impressionist by some and an early modernist by others though his works also contain elements of 19th-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters as in Lord Jim for example have influenced numerous authors. Many dramatic films have been adapted from and inspired by his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that his fictional works written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century seem to have anticipated later world events. Writing near the peak of the British Empire Conrad drew on the national experiences of his native Polandduring nearly all his life parceled out among three occupying empiresand on his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated worldincluding imperialism and colonialismand that profoundly explore the human psyche.Postcolonial analysis of Conrads work has stimulated substantial debate; in 1975 author Chinua Achebe published an article denouncing Heart of Darkness as racist and dehumanising whereas other scholars including Adam Hochschild and Peter Edgerly Firchow have rebutted Achebes view. Conrad was born on 3 December 1857 in Berdychiv Ukraine then part of the Russian Empire; the region had once been part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. He was the only child of Apollo Korzeniowskia writer translator political activist and would-be revolutionaryand his wife Ewa Bobrowska. He was christened Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski after his maternal grandfather Józef his paternal grandfather Teodor and the heroes of two poems by Adam Mickiewicz Dziady and Konrad Wallenrod. His family called him Konrad rather than Józef. Though the vast majority of the surrounding areas inhabitants were Ukrainians and the great majority of Berdychivs residents were Jewish almost all the countryside was owned by the Polish szlachta to which Conrads family belonged as bearers of the Nałęcz coat-of-arms. Polish literature particularly patriotic literature was held in high esteem by the areas Polish population. Poland had been divided among Prussia Austria and Russia in 1795. The Korzeniowski family had played a significant role in Polish attempts to regain independence. Conrads paternal grandfather Teodor had served under Prince Józef Poniatowski during Napoleons Russian campaign and had formed his own cavalry squadron during the November 1830 Uprising of Poland-Lithuania against the Russian Empire. Conrads fiercely patriotic father Apollo belonged to the Red political faction whose goal was to re-establish the pre-partition boundaries of Poland and which also advocated land reform and the abolition of serfdom. Conrads subsequent refusal to follow in Apollos footsteps and his choice of exile over resistance were a source of lifelong guilt for Conrad. Because of the fathers attempts at farming and his political activism the family moved repeatedly. In May 1861 they moved to Warsaw where Apollo joined the resistance against the Russian Empire. He was arrested and imprisoned in Pavilion X of the Warsaw Citadel. Conrad would write n the courtyard of this Citadelcharacteristically for our nationmy childhood memories begin. On 9 May 1862 Apollo and his family were exiled to Vologda 500 kilometres north of Moscow and known for its bad climate. In January 1863 Apollos sentence was commuted and the family was sent to Chernihiv in northeast Ukraine where conditions were much better. However on 18 April 1865 Ewa died of tuberculosis. Apollo did his best to teach Conrad at home. The boys early reading introduced him to the two elements that later dominated his life in Victor Hugos Toilers of the Sea he encountered the sphere of activity to which he would devote his youth; Shakespeare brought him into the orbit of English literature. Most of all though he read Polish Romantic poetry. Half a century later he explained that  In the autumn of 1866 young Conrad was sent for a year-long retreat for health reasons to Kyiv and his mothers family estate at Novofastiv. In December 1867 Apollo took his son to the Austrian-held part of Poland which for two years had been enjoying considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After sojourns in Lwów and several smaller localities on 20 February 1869 they moved to Kraków likewise in Austrian Poland. A few months later on 23 May 1869 Apollo Korzeniowski died leaving Conrad orphaned at the age of eleven. Like Conrads mother Apollo had been gravely ill with tuberculosis. The young Conrad was placed in the care of Ewas brother Tadeusz Bobrowski. Conrads poor health and his unsatisfactory schoolwork caused his uncle constant problems and no end of financial outlay. Conrad was not a good student; despite tutoring he excelled only in geography. At that time he likely received private tutoring only as there is no evidence he attended any school regularly. Since the boys illness was clearly of nervous origin the physicians supposed that fresh air and physical work would harden him; his uncle hoped that well-defined duties and the rigors of work would teach him discipline. Since he showed little inclination to study it was essential that he learn a trade; his uncle thought he could work as a sailor-cum-businessman who would combine maritime skills with commercial activities. In the autumn of 1871 thirteen-year-old Conrad announced his intention to become a sailor. He later recalled that as a child he had read Leopold McClintocks book about his 185759 expeditions in the Fox in search of Sir John Franklins lost ships Erebus and Terror. Conrad also recalled having read books by the American James Fenimore Cooper and the English Captain Frederick Marryat. A playmate of his adolescence recalled that Conrad spun fantastic yarns always set at sea presented so realistically that listeners thought the action was happening before their eyes. In August 1873 Bobrowski sent fifteen-year-old Conrad to Lwów to a cousin who ran a small boarding house for boys orphaned by the 1863 Uprising; group conversation there was in French. The owners daughter recalled He stayed with us ten months... Intellectually he was extremely advanced but from severe headaches and nervous attacks... Conrad had been at the establishment for just over a year when in September 1874 for uncertain reasons his uncle removed him from school in Lwów and took him back to Kraków. On 13 October 1874 Bobrowski sent the sixteen-year-old to Marseilles France for Conrads planned merchant-marine career on French merchant ships. His uncle provided him with a monthly stipend as well . Though Conrad had not completed secondary school his accomplishments included fluency in French some knowledge of Latin German and Greek; probably a good knowledge of history some geography and probably already an interest in physics. He was well read particularly in Polish Romantic literature. He belonged to the second generation in his family that had had to earn a living outside the family estates. They were born and reared partly in the milieu of the working intelligentsia a social class that was starting to play an important role in Central and Eastern Europe. He had absorbed enough of the history culture and literature of his native land to be able eventually to develop a distinctive world view and make unique contributions to the literature of his adoptive Britain. Tensions that originated in his childhood in Poland and increased in his adulthood abroad contributed to Conrads greatest literary achievements.Zdzisław Najder himself an emigrant from Poland observes Living away from ones natural environmentfamily friends social group languageeven if it results from a conscious decision usually gives rise to... internal tensions because it tends to make people less sure of themselves more vulnerable less certain of their... position and... value... The Polish szlachta and... intelligentsia were social strata in which reputation... was felt... very important... for a feeling of self-worth. Men strove... to find confirmation of their... self-regard... in the eyes of others... Such a psychological heritage forms both a spur to ambition and a source of constant stress especially if s public duty... Some critics have suggested that when Conrad left Poland he wanted to break once and for all with his Polish past. In refutation of this Najder quotes from Conrads 14 August 1883 letter to family friend Stefan Buszczyński written nine years after Conrad had left Poland In Marseilles Conrad had an intense social life often stretching his budget. A trace of these years can be found in the northern Corsica town of Luri where there is a plaque to a Corsican merchant seaman Dominique Cervoni whom Conrad befriended. Cervoni became the inspiration for some of Conrads characters such as the title character of the 1904 novel Nostromo. Conrad visited Corsica with his wife in 1921 partly in search of connections with his long-dead friend and fellow merchant seaman. In late 1877 Conrads maritime career was interrupted by the refusal of the Russian consul to provide documents needed for him to continue his service. As a result Conrad fell into debt and in March 1878 he attempted suicide. He survived and received further financial aid from his uncle allowing him to resume his normal life. After nearly four years in France and on French ships Conrad joined the British merchant marine enlisting in April 1878 . For the next fifteen years he served under the Red Ensign. He worked on a variety of ships as crew member and then as third second and first mate until eventually achieving captains rank. During the 19 years from the time that Conrad had left Kraków in October 1874 until he signed off the Adowa in January 1894 he had worked in ships including long periods in port for 10 years and almost 8 months. He had spent just over 8 years at sea9 months of it as a passenger. His sole captaincy took place in 188889 when he commanded the barque Otago from Sydney to Mauritius. During a brief call in India in 188586 28-year-old Conrad sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at Cardiff in June 1885 just before sailing for Singapore in the clipper ship Tilkhurst. These letters are Conrads first preserved texts in English. His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish syntax and phraseology. More importantly the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 188183. He had abandoned hope for the future and the conceit of sailing toward Poland and his Panslavic ideas. He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge. While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914. The year 1890 marked Conrads first return to Poland where he would visit his uncle and other relatives and acquaintances. This visit took place while he was waiting to proceed to the Congo Free State having been hired by Albert Thys deputy director of the Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo. Conrads association with the Belgian company on the Congo River would inspire his novella Heart of Darkness. During this 1890 period in the Congo Conrad befriended Roger Casement who was also working for Thys operating a trading and transport station in Matadi. In 1903 as British Consul to Boma Casement was commissioned to investigate abuses in the Congo and later in Amazonian Peru and was knighted in 1911 for his advocacy of human rights. Casement later became active in Irish Republicanism after leaving the British consular service. Conrad left Africa at the end of December 1890 arriving in Brussels by late January of the following year. He rejoined the British merchant marines as first mate in November. When he left London on 25 October 1892 aboard the passenger clipper ship Torrens one of the passengers was William Henry Jacques a consumptive Cambridge University graduate who died less than a year later on 19 September 1893. According to Conrads A Personal Record Jacques was the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of Conrads Almayers Folly. Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel. Conrad completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman on 26 July 1893 when the Torrens docked at London and J. Conrad Korzemowinper the certificate of dischargedebarked.  When the Torrens had left Adelaide on 13 March 1893 the passengers had included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and New Zealand 25-year-old lawyer and future novelist John Galsworthy; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson who was going to help his father run a boys preparatory school at Elstree. They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship and he would remain in touch with both. In one of Galsworthys first literary attempts The Doldrums the protagonistfirst mate Armandis modelled after Conrad.  At Cape Town where the Torrens remained from 17 to 19 May Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines. Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad. Later that year Conrad would visit his relatives in Poland and Ukraine once again. In the autumn of 1889 Conrad began writing his first novel Almayers Folly. Conrads later letters to literary friends show the attention that he devoted to analysis of style to individual words and expressions to the emotional tone of phrases to the atmosphere created by language. In this Conrad in his own way followed the example of Gustave Flaubert notorious for searching days on end for le mot justefor the right word to render the essence of the matter. Najder opines In 1894 aged 36 Conrad reluctantly gave up the sea partly because of poor health partly due to unavailability of ships and partly because he had become so fascinated with writing that he had decided on a literary career. Almayers Folly set on the east coast of Borneo was published in 1895. Its appearance marked his first use of the pen name Joseph Conrad; Konrad was of course the third of his Polish given names but his use of itin the anglicised version Conradmay also have been an homage to the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewiczs patriotic narrative poem Konrad Wallenrod. Edward Garnett a young publishers reader and literary critic who would play one of the chief supporting roles in Conrads literary career hadlike Unwins first reader of Almayers Folly Wilfrid Hugh Chessonbeen impressed by the manuscript but Garnett had been uncertain whether the English was good enough for publication. Garnett had shown the novel to his wife Constance Garnett later a translator of Russian literature. She had thought Conrads foreignness a positive merit. While Conrad had only limited personal acquaintance with the peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia the region looms large in his early work. According to Najder Conrad the exile and wanderer was aware of a difficulty that he confessed more than once the lack of a common cultural background with his Anglophone readers meant he could not compete with English-language authors writing about the English-speaking world. At the same time the choice of a non-English colonial setting freed him from an embarrassing division of loyalty Almayers Folly and later An Outpost of Progress and Heart of Darkness contain bitter reflections on colonialism. The Malay states came theoretically under the suzerainty of the Dutch government; Conrad did not write about the areas British dependencies which he never visited. He was apparently intrigued by... struggles aimed at preserving national independence. The prolific and destructive richness of tropical nature and the dreariness of human life within it accorded well with the pessimistic mood of his early works. Almayers Folly together with its successor An Outcast of the Islands laid the foundation for Conrads reputation as a romantic teller of exotic talesa misunderstanding of his purpose that was to frustrate him for the rest of his career. Almost all of Conrads writings were first published in newspapers and magazines influential reviews like The Fortnightly Review and the North American Review; avant-garde publications like the Savoy New Review and The English Review; popular short-fiction magazines like The Saturday Evening Post and Harpers Magazine; womens journals like the Pictorial Review and Romance; mass-circulation dailies like the Daily Mail and the New York Herald; and illustrated newspapers like The Illustrated London News and the Illustrated Buffalo Express. He also wrote for The Outlook an imperialist weekly magazine between 1898 and 1906. Financial success long eluded Conrad who often requested advances from magazine and book publishers and loans from acquaintances such as John Galsworthy. Eventually a government grant of 100 per annum awarded on 9 August 1910 somewhat relieved his financial worries and in time collectors began purchasing his manuscripts. Though his talent was early on recognised by English intellectuals popular success eluded him until the 1913 publication of Chance which is often considered one of his weaker novels. Conrad was a reserved man wary of showing emotion. He scorned sentimentality; his manner of portraying emotion in his books was full of restraint scepticism and irony. In the words of his uncle Bobrowski as a young man Conrad was extremely sensitive conceited reserved and in addition excitable. In short all the defects of the Nałęcz family. Conrad suffered throughout life from ill health physical and mental. A newspaper review of a Conrad biography suggested that the book could have been subtitled Thirty Years of Debt Gout Depression and Angst. In 1891 he was hospitalised for several months suffering from gout neuralgic pains in his right arm and recurrent attacks of malaria. He also complained of swollen hands which made writing difficult. Taking his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowskis advice he convalesced at a spa in Switzerland. Conrad had a phobia of dentistry neglecting his teeth until they had to be extracted. In one letter he remarked that every novel he had written had cost him a tooth. Conrads physical afflictions were if anything less vexatious than his mental ones. In his letters he often described symptoms of depression; the evidence writes Najder is so strong that it is nearly impossible to doubt it. In March 1878 at the end of his Marseilles period 20-year-old Conrad attempted suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a revolver. According to his uncle who was summoned by a friend Conrad had fallen into debt. Bobrowski described his subsequent study of his nephew in an extensive letter to Stefan Buszczyński his own ideological opponent and a friend of Conrads late father Apollo. To what extent the suicide attempt had been made in earnest likely will never be known but it is suggestive of a situational depression. In 1888 during a stop-over on Mauritius in the Indian Ocean Conrad developed a couple of romantic interests. One of these would be described in his 1910 story A Smile of Fortune which contains autobiographical elements . The narrator a young captain flirts ambiguously and surreptitiously with Alice Jacobus daughter of a local merchant living in a house surrounded by a magnificent rose garden. Research has confirmed that in Port Louis at the time there was a 17-year-old Alice Shaw whose father a shipping agent owned the only rose garden in town. More is known about Conrads other more open flirtation. An old friend Captain Gabriel Renouf of the French merchant marine introduced him to the family of his brother-in-law. Renoufs eldest sister was the wife of Louis Edward Schmidt a senior official in the colony; with them lived two other sisters and two brothers. Though the island had been taken over in 1810 by Britain many of the inhabitants were descendants of the original French colonists and Conrads excellent French and perfect manners opened all local salons to him. He became a frequent guest at the Schmidts where he often met the Misses Renouf. A couple of days before leaving Port Louis Conrad asked one of the Renouf brothers for the hand of his 26-year-old sister Eugenie. She was already however engaged to marry her pharmacist cousin. After the rebuff Conrad did not pay a farewell visit but sent a polite letter to Gabriel Renouf saying he would never return to Mauritius and adding that on the day of the wedding his thoughts would be with them. On 24 March 1896 Conrad married an Englishwoman Jessie George. The couple had two sons Borys and John. The elder Borys proved a disappointment in scholarship and integrity. Jessie was an unsophisticated working-class girl sixteen years younger than Conrad. To his friends she was an inexplicable choice of wife and the subject of some rather disparaging and unkind remarks. However according to other biographers such as Frederick Karl Jessie provided what Conrad needed namely a straightforward devoted quite competent companion. Similarly Jones remarks that despite whatever difficulties the marriage endured there can be no doubt that the relationship sustained Conrads career as a writer which might have been much less successful without her. The couple rented a long series of successive homes mostly in the English countryside. Conrad who suffered frequent depressions made great efforts to change his mood; the most important step was to move into another house. His frequent changes of home were usually signs of a search for psychological regeneration. Between 1910 and 1919 Conrads home was Capel House in Orlestone Kent which was rented to him by Lord and Lady Oliver. It was here that he wrote The Rescue Victory and The Arrow of Gold. Except for several vacations in France and Italy a 1914 vacation in his native Poland and a 1923 visit to the United States Conrad lived the rest of his life in England. The 1914 vacation with his wife and sons in Poland at the urging of Józef Retinger coincided with the outbreak of World War I. On 28 July 1914 the day war broke out between Austro-Hungary and Serbia Conrad and the Retingers arrived in Kraków where Conrad visited childhood haunts. As the city lay only a few miles from the Russian border there was a risk of being stranded in a battle zone. With wife Jessie and younger son John ill Conrad decided to take refuge in the mountain resort town of Zakopane. They left Kraków on 2 August. A few days after arrival in Zakopane they moved to the Konstantynówka pension operated by Conrads cousin Aniela Zagórska; it had been frequented by celebrities including the statesman Józef Piłsudski and Conrads acquaintance the young concert pianist Artur Rubinstein. Zagórska introduced Conrad to Polish writers intellectuals and artists who had also taken refuge in Zakopane including novelist Stefan Żeromski and Tadeusz Nalepiński a writer friend of anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski. Conrad aroused interest among the Poles as a famous writer and an exotic compatriot from abroad. He charmed new acquaintances especially women. However Marie Curies physician sister Bronisława Dłuska wife of fellow physician and eminent socialist activist Kazimierz Dłuski openly berated Conrad for having used his great talent for purposes other than bettering the future of his native land. But thirty-two-year-old Aniela Zagórska Conrads niece who would translate his works into Polish in 192339 idolised him kept him company and provided him with books. He particularly delighted in the stories and novels of the ten-years-older recently deceased Bolesław Prus read everything by his fellow victim of Polands 1863 Uprisingmy beloved Prusthat he could get his hands on and pronounced him better than Dickensa favourite English novelist of Conrads. Conrad who was noted by his Polish acquaintances to still be fluent in his native tongue participated in their impassioned political discussions. He declared presciently as Józef Piłsudski had earlier in 1914 in Paris that in the war for Poland to regain independence Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers and the Central Powers must in turn be beaten by France and Britain. After many travails and vicissitudes at the beginning of November 1914 Conrad managed to bring his family back to England. On his return he was determined to work on swaying British opinion in favour of restoring Polands sovereignty. Jessie Conrad would later write in her memoirs I understood my husband so much better after those months in Poland. So many characteristics that had been strange and unfathomable to me before took as it were their right proportions. I understood that his temperament was that of his countrymen. Conrad was passionately concerned with politics. was Conrads historical awareness. His Polish experience endowed him with the perception exceptional in the Western European literature of his time of how winding and constantly changing were the front lines in these struggles. The most extensive and ambitious political statement that Conrad ever made was his 1905 essay Autocracy and War whose starting point was the Russo-Japanese War . The essay begins with a statement about Russias incurable weakness and ends with warnings against Prussia the dangerous aggressor in a future European war. For Russia he predicted a violent outburst in the near future but Russias lack of democratic traditions and the backwardness of her masses made it impossible for the revolution to have a salutary effect. Conrad regarded the formation of a representative government in Russia as unfeasible and foresaw a transition from autocracy to dictatorship. He saw western Europe as torn by antagonisms engendered by economic rivalry and commercial selfishness. In vain might a Russian revolution seek advice or help from a materialistic and egoistic western Europe that armed itself in preparation for wars far more brutal than those of the past. Conrads distrust of democracy sprang from his doubts whether the propagation of democracy as an aim in itself could solve any problems. He thought that in view of the weakness of human nature and of the criminal character of society democracy offered boundless opportunities for demagogues and charlatans. Conrad kept his distance from partisan politics and never voted in British national elections. He accused social democrats of his time of acting to weaken the national sentiment the preservation of which concernof attempting to dissolve national identities in an impersonal melting-pot. I look at the future from the depth of a very black past and I find that nothing is left for me except fidelity to a cause lost to an idea without future. It was Conrads hopeless fidelity to the memory of Poland that prevented him from believing in the idea of international fraternity which he considered under the circumstances just a verbal exercise. He resented some socialists talk of freedom and world brotherhood while keeping silent about his own partitioned and oppressed Poland. Before that in the early 1880s letters to Conrad from his uncle Tadeusz show Conrad apparently having hoped for an improvement in Polands situation not through a liberation movement but by establishing an alliance with neighbouring Slavic nations. This had been accompanied by a faith in the Panslavic ideologysurprising Najder writes in a man who was later to emphasize his hostility towards Russia a conviction that... Polands doubts about Polands chances of becoming a fully sovereign nation-state. Conrads alienation from partisan politics went together with an abiding sense of the thinking mans burden imposed by his personality as described in an 1894 letter by Conrad to a relative-by-marriage and fellow author Marguerite Poradowska of Brussels We must drag the chain and ball of our personality to the end. This is the price one pays for the infernal and divine privilege of thought; so in this life it is only the chosen who are convictsa glorious band which understands and groans but which treads the earth amidst a multitude of phantoms with maniacal gestures and idiotic grimaces. Which would you rather be idiot or convict Conrad wrote H. G. Wells that the latters 1901 book Anticipations an ambitious attempt to predict major social trends seems to presuppose... a sort of select circle to which you address yourself leaving the rest of the world outside the pale. you do not take sufficient account of human imbecility which is cunning and perfidious. In a 23 October 1922 letter to mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell in response to the latters book The Problem of China which advocated socialist reforms and an oligarchy of sages who would reshape Chinese society Conrad explained his own distrust of political panaceas I have never even if man has taken to flyinga great uplift no doubt but no great change.... Conrad... adopted a broader ironic stancea sort of blanket incredulity defined by a character in Under Western Eyes as the negation of all faith devotion and action. Through control of tone and narrative detail... Conrad exposes what he considered to be the naïveté of movements like anarchism and socialism and the self-serving logic of such historical but naturalized phenomena as capitalism rationalism and imperialism . To be ironic is to be awakeand alert to the prevailing somnolence. In Nostromo... the journalist Martin Decoud... ridicul the idea that people believe themselves to be influencing the fate of the universe.  If irony exists to suggest that theres more to things than meets the eye Conrad further insists that when we pay close enough attention the more can be endless. He doesnt reject what calls the haggard utilitarian lies of our civilisation in favor of nothing; he rejects them in favor of something some saving truth some exorcism against the ghost of doubtan intimation of a deeper order one not easily reduced to words. Authentic self-aware emotionfeeling that doesnt call itself theory or wisdombecomes a kind of standard-bearer with impressions or sensations the nearest you get to solid proof. In an August 1901 letter to the editor of The New York Times Saturday Book Review Conrad wrote Egoism which is the moving force of the world and altruism which is its morality these two contradictory instincts of which one is so plain and the other so mysterious cannot serve us unless in the incomprehensible alliance of their irreconcilable antagonism. On 3 August 1924 Conrad died at his house Oswalds in Bishopsbourne Kent England probably of a heart attack. He was interred at Canterbury Cemetery Canterbury under a misspelled version of his original Polish name as Joseph Teador Conrad Korzeniowski. Inscribed on his gravestone are the lines from Edmund Spensers The Faerie Queene which he had chosen as the epigraph to his last complete novel The Rover Sleep after toyle port after stormie seasEase after warre death after life doth greatly please Conrads modest funeral took place amid great crowds. His old friend Edward Garnett recalled bitterly To those who attended Conrads funeral in Canterbury during the Cricket Festival of 1924 and drove through the crowded streets festooned with flags there was something symbolical in Englands hospitality and in the crowds ignorance of even the existence of this great writer. A few old friends acquaintances and pressmen stood by his grave. Another old friend of Conrads Cunninghame Graham wrote Garnett Aubry was saying to me... that had Anatole France died all Paris would have been at his funeral. Conrads wife Jessie died twelve years later on 6 December 1936 and was interred with him. In 1996 his grave was designated a Grade II listed structure. Despite the opinions even of some who knew Conrad personally such as fellow-novelist Henry James Conradeven when only writing elegantly crafted letters to his uncle and acquaintanceswas always at heart a writer who sailed rather than a sailor who wrote. He used his sailing experiences as a backdrop for many of his works but he also produced works of similar world view without the nautical motifs. The failure of many critics to appreciate this caused him much frustration. He wrote oftener about life at sea and in exotic parts than about life on British land becauseunlike for example his friend John Galsworthy author of The Forsyte Sagahe knew little about everyday domestic relations in Britain. When Conrads The Mirror of the Sea was published in 1906 to critical acclaim he wrote to his French translator The critics have been vigorously swinging the censer to me.... Behind the concert of flattery I can hear something like a whisper Keep to the open sea Dont land They want to banish me to the middle of the ocean. Writing to his friend Richard Curle Conrad remarked that the public mind fastens on externals such as his sea life oblivious to how authors transform their material from particular to general and appeal to universal emotions by the temperamental handling of personal experience. Nevertheless Conrad found much sympathetic readership especially in the United States. H.L. Mencken was one of the earliest and most influential American readers to recognise how Conrad conjured up the general out of the particular. F. Scott Fitzgerald writing to Mencken complained about having been omitted from a list of Conrad imitators. Since Fitzgerald dozens of other American writers have acknowledged their debts to Conrad including William Faulkner William Burroughs Saul Bellow Philip Roth Joan Didion and Thomas Pynchon. An October 1923 visitor to Oswalds Conrads home at the timeCyril Clemens a cousin of Mark Twainquoted Conrad as saying In everything I have written there is always one invariable intention and that is to capture the readers attention. Conrad the artist famously aspired in the words of his preface to The Nigger of the Narcissus by the power of the written word to make you hear to make you feel... before all to make you see. Thatand no more and it is everything. If I succeed you shall find there according to your deserts encouragement consolation fear charmall you demandand perhaps also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask. Writing in what to the visual arts was the age of Impressionism and what to music was the age of impressionist music Conrad showed himself in many of his works a prose poet of the highest order for instance in the evocative Patna and courtroom scenes of Lord Jim; in the scenes of the melancholy-mad elephant and the French gunboat firing into a continent in Heart of Darkness; in the doubled protagonists of The Secret Sharer; and in the verbal and conceptual resonances of Nostromo and The Nigger of the Narcissus. Conrad used his own memories as literary material so often that readers are tempted to treat his life and work as a single whole. His view of the world or elements of it is often described by citing at once both his private and public statements passages from his letters and citations from his books. Najder warns that this approach produces an incoherent and misleading picture. An... uncritical linking of the two spheres literature and private life distorts each. Conrad used his own experiences as raw material but the finished product should not be confused with the experiences themselves. Many of Conrads characters were inspired by actual persons he had met including in his first novel Almayers Folly William Charles Olmeijer the spelling of whose surname Conrad probably altered to Almayer inadvertently. The historic trader Olmeijer whom Conrad encountered on his four short visits to Berau in Borneo subsequently haunted Conrads imagination. Conrad often borrowed the authentic names of actual individuals e.g. Captain McWhirr Captain Beard and Mr. Mahon Captain Lingard and Captain Ellis . Conrad writes J. I. M. Stewart appears to have attached some mysterious significance to such links with actuality. Equally curious is a great deal of namelessness in Conrad requiring some minor virtuosity to maintain. Thus we never learn the surname of the protagonist of Lord Jim. Conrad also preserves in The Nigger of the Narcissus the authentic name of the ship the Narcissus in which he sailed in 1884. Apart from Conrads own experiences a number of episodes in his fiction were suggested by past or contemporary publicly known events or literary works. The first half of the 1900 novel Lord Jim was inspired by the real-life 1880 story of the SSJeddah; the second part to some extent by the life of James Brooke the first White Rajah of Sarawak. The 1901 short story Amy Foster was inspired partly by an anecdote in Ford Madox Fords The Cinque Ports wherein a shipwrecked sailor from a German merchant ship unable to communicate in English and driven away by the local country people finally found shelter in a pigsty. In Nostromo the theft of a massive consignment of silver was suggested to Conrad by a story he had heard in the Gulf of Mexico and later read about in a volume picked up outside a second-hand bookshop. The novels political strand according to Maya Jasanoff is related to the creation of the Panama Canal. In January 1903 she writes just as Conrad started writing Nostromo the US and Colombian secretaries of state signed a treaty granting the United States a one-hundred-year renewable lease on a six-mile strip flanking the canal... While the mine. The Secret Agent was inspired by the French anarchist Martial Bourdins 1894 death while apparently attempting to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. Conrads story The Secret Sharer was inspired by an 1880 incident when Sydney Smith first mate of the Cutty Sark had killed a seaman and fled from justice aided by the ships captain. The plot of Under Western Eyes is kicked off by the assassination of a brutal Russian government minister modelled after the real-life 1904 assassination of Russian Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve. The near-novella Freya of the Seven Isles was inspired by a story told to Conrad by a Malaya old hand and fan of Conrads Captain Carlos M. Marris. For the natural surroundings of the high seas the Malay Archipelago and South America which Conrad described so vividly he could rely on his own observations. What his brief landfalls could not provide was a thorough understanding of exotic cultures. For this he resorted like other writers to literary sources. When writing his Malayan stories he consulted Alfred Russel Wallaces The Malay Archipelago James Brookes journals and books with titles like Perak and the Malays My Journal in Malayan Waters and Life in the Forests of the Far East. When he set about writing his novel Nostromo set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana he turned to The War between Peru and Chile; Edward Eastwick Venezuela or Sketches of Life in a South American Republic ; and George Frederick Masterman Seven Eventful Years in Paraguay . As a result of relying on literary sources in Lord Jim as J. I. M. Stewart writes Conrads need to work to some extent from second-hand led to a certain thinness in Jims relations with the... peoples... of Patusan... This prompted Conrad at some points to alter the nature of Charles Marlows narrative to distanc an uncertain command of the detail of Tuan Jims empire. In keeping with his scepticism and melancholy Conrad almost invariably gives lethal fates to the characters in his principal novels and stories. Almayer abandoned by his beloved daughter takes to opium and dies. Peter Willems is killed by his jealous lover Aïssa. The ineffectual Nigger James Wait dies aboard ship and is buried at sea. Mr. Kurtz expires uttering the words The horror The horrorTuan Jim having inadvertently precipitated a massacre of his adoptive community deliberately walks to his death at the hands of the communitys leader. In Conrads 1901 short story Amy Foster a Pole transplanted to England Yanko Goorall falls ill and suffering from a fever raves in his native language frightening his wife Amy who flees; next morning Yanko dies of heart failure and it transpires that he had simply been asking in Polish for water. Captain Whalley betrayed by failing eyesight and an unscrupulous partner drowns himself. Gian Battista Fidanza the eponymous respected Italian-immigrant Nostromo of the novel Nostromo illicitly obtains a treasure of silver mined in the South American country of Costaguana and is shot dead due to mistaken identity. Mr. Verloc The Secret Agent of divided loyalties attempts a bombing to be blamed on terrorists that accidentally kills his mentally defective brother-in-law Stevie and Verloc himself is killed by his distraught wife who drowns herself by jumping overboard from a channel steamer. In Chance Roderick Anthony a sailing-ship captain and benefactor and husband of Flora de Barral becomes the target of a poisoning attempt by her jealous disgraced financier father who when detected swallows the poison himself and dies . In Victory Lena is shot dead by Jones who had meant to kill his accomplice Ricardo and later succeeds in doing so then himself perishes along with another accomplice after which Lenas protector Axel Heyst sets fire to his bungalow and dies beside Lenas body. When a principal character of Conrads does escape with his life he sometimes does not fare much better. In Under Western Eyes Razumov betrays a fellow University of St. Petersburg student the revolutionist Victor Haldin who has assassinated a savagely repressive Russian government minister. Haldin is tortured and hanged by the authorities. Later Razumov sent as a government spy to Geneva a centre of anti-tsarist intrigue meets the mother and sister of Haldin who share Haldins liberal convictions. Razumov falls in love with the sister and confesses his betrayal of her brother; later he makes the same avowal to assembled revolutionists and their professional executioner bursts his eardrums making him deaf for life. Razumov staggers away is knocked down by a streetcar and finally returns as a cripple to Russia. Conrad was keenly conscious of tragedy in the world and in his works. In 1898 at the start of his writing career he had written to his Scottish writer-politician friend Cunninghame Graham What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature it is that they are conscious of it. s soon as you know of your slavery the pain the anger the strifethe tragedy begins. But in 1922 near the end of his life and career when another Scottish friend Richard Curle sent Conrad proofs of two articles he had written about Conrad the latter objected to being characterised as a gloomy and tragic writer. That reputation... has deprived me of innumerable readers... I absolutely object to being called a tragedian. Conrad claimed that he never kept a diary and never owned a notebook. John Galsworthy who knew him well described this as a statement which surprised no one who knew the resources of his memory and the brooding nature of his creative spirit. Nevertheless after Conrads death Richard Curle published a heavily modified version of Conrads diaries describing his experiences in the Congo; in 1978 a more complete version was published as The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces. The first accurate transcription was published in Robert Hampsons Penguin edition of Heart of Darkness in 1995; Hampsons transcription and annotations were reprinted in the Penguin edition of 2007. Unlike many authors who make it a point not to discuss work in progress Conrad often did discuss his current work and even showed it to select friends and fellow authors such as Edward Garnett and sometimes modified it in the light of their critiques and suggestions. Edward Said was struck by the sheer quantity of Conrads correspondence with friends and fellow writers; by 1966 it amount life was like a series of short episodes... because he was himself so many different people... he was a Pole and an Englishman a sailor and a writer. Another scholar Najder writes Throughout almost his entire life Conrad was an outsider and felt himself to be one. An outsider in exile; an outsider during his visits to his family in the Ukraine; an outsiderbecause of his experiences and bereavementin e regarded the national spirit as the only truly permanent and reliable element of communal life. Conrad borrowed from other Polish- and French-language authors to an extent sometimes skirting plagiarism. When the Polish translation of his 1915 novel Victory appeared in 1931 readers noted striking similarities to Stefan Żeromskis kitschy novel The History of a Sin including their endings. Comparative-literature scholar Yves Hervouet has demonstrated in the text of Victory a whole mosaic of influences borrowings similarities and allusions. He further lists hundreds of concrete borrowings from other mostly French authors in nearly all of Conrads works from Almayers Folly to his unfinished Suspense. Conrad seems to have used eminent writers texts as raw material of the same kind as the content of his own memory. Materials borrowed from other authors often functioned as allusions. Moreover he had a phenomenal memory for texts and remembered details but it was not a memory strictly categorized according to sources marshalled into homogeneous entities; it was rather an enormous receptacle of images and pieces from which he would draw. Continues Najder than a tree can grow out of air. Conrad like other artists faced constraints arising from the need to propitiate his audience and confirm their own favourable self-regard. This may account for his describing the admirable crew of the Judea in his 1898 story Youth as Liverpool hard cases whereas the crew of the Judeas actual 1882 prototype the Palestine had included not a single Liverpudlian and half the crew had been non-Britons; and for Conrads transforming the real-life 1880 criminally negligent British captain J. L. Clark of the SSJeddah in his 1900 novel Lord Jim into the captain of the fictitious Patnaa sort of renegade New South Wales German so monstrous in physical appearance as to suggest a trained baby elephant. Similarly in his letters Conradduring most of his literary career struggling for sheer financial survivaloften adjusted his views to the predilections of his correspondents.Historians have also noted that Conrads works which were set in European colonies and intended to critique the effects of colonialism were set in Dutch and Belgian colonies instead of the British Empire. The singularity of the universe depicted in Conrads novels especially compared to those of near-contemporaries like his friend and frequent benefactor John Galsworthy is such as to open him to criticism similar to that later applied to Graham Greene. But where Greeneland has been characterised as a recurring and recognisable atmosphere independent of setting Conrad is at pains to create a sense of place be it aboard ship or in a remote village; often he chose to have his characters play out their destinies in isolated or confined circumstances. In the view of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis it was not until the first volumes of Anthony Powells sequence A Dance to the Music of Time were published in the 1950s that an English novelist achieved the same command of atmosphere and precision of language with consistency a view supported by later critics like A. N. Wilson; Powell acknowledged his debt to Conrad. Leo Gurko too remarks as one of Conrads special qualities his abnormal awareness of place an awareness magnified to almost a new dimension in art an ecological dimension defining the relationship between earth and man. T. E. Lawrence one of many writers whom Conrad befriended offered some perceptive observations about Conrads writing Hes absolutely the most haunting thing in prose that ever was I wish I knew how every paragraph he writes goes on sounding in waves like the note of a tenor bell after it stops. Its not built in the rhythm of ordinary prose but on something existing only in his head and as he can never say what it is he wants to say all his things end in a kind of hunger a suggestion of something he cant say or do or think. So his books always look bigger than they are. Hes as much a giant of the subjective as Kipling is of the objective. Do they hate one another The Irish novelist-poet-critic Colm Tóibín captures something similar Joseph Conrads heroes were often alone and close to hostility and danger. Sometimes when Conrads imagination was at its most fertile and his command of English at its most precise the danger came darkly from within the self. At other times however it came from what could not be named. Conrad sought then to evoke rather than delineate using something close to the language of prayer. While his imagination was content at times with the tiny vivid perfectly observed detail it was also nourished by the need to suggest and symbolize. Like a poet he often left the space in between strangely alluringly vacant. His own vague termswords like ineffable infinite mysterious unknowablewere as close as he could come to a sense of our fate in the world or the essence of the universe a sense that reached beyond the time he described and beyond his characters circumstances. This idea of beyond satisfied something in his imagination. He worked as though between the intricate systems of a ship and the vague horizon of a vast sea. In a letter of 14 December 1897 to his Scottish friend Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham Conrad wrote that science tells us Understand that thou art nothing less than a shadow more insignificant than a drop of water in the ocean more fleeting than the illusion of a dream. In a letter of 20 December 1897 to Cunninghame Graham Conrad metaphorically described the universe as a huge machine It evolved itself out of a chaos of scraps of iron and beholdit knits. I am horrified at the horrible work and stand appalled. I feel it ought to embroiderbut it goes on knitting. You come and say this is all right; its only a question of the right kind of oil. Let us use thisfor instancecelestial oil and the machine shall embroider a most beautiful design in purple and gold. Will it Alas no. You cannot by any special lubrication make embroidery with a knitting machine. And the most withering thought is that the infamous thing has made itself; made itself without thought without conscience without foresight without eyes without heart. It is a tragic accidentand it has happened. You cant interfere with it. The last drop of bitterness is in the suspicion that you cant even smash it. In virtue of that truth one and immortal which lurks in the force that made it spring into existence it is what it isand it is indestructibleIt knits us in and it knits us out. It has knitted time space pain death corruption despair and all the illusionsand nothing matters. Conrad wrote Cunninghame Graham on 31 January 1898 Faith is a myth and beliefs shift like mists on the shore; thoughts vanish; words once pronounced die; and the memory of yesterday is as shadowy as the hope of to-morrow.... In this worldas I have known itwe are made to suffer without the shadow of a reason of a cause or of guilt.... There is no morality no knowledge and no hope; there is only the consciousness of ourselves which drives us about a world that... is always but a vain and fleeting appearance.... What really learned as a sailor was not something empiricalan assembly of places and eventsbut the vindication of a perspective he had developed in childhood an impartial unillusioned view of the world as a place of mystery and contingency horror and splendor where as he put it in a letter to the London Times the only indisputable truth is our ignorance. Conrad spoke his native Polish and the French language fluently from childhood and only acquired English in his twenties. He would probably have spoken some Ukrainian as a child; he certainly had to have some knowledge of German and Russian. His son Borys records that though Conrad had insisted that he spoke only a few words of German when they reached the Austrian frontier in the familys attempt to leave Poland in 1914 Conrad spoke German at considerable length and extreme fluency. Russia Prussia and Austria had divided up Poland among them and he was officially a Russian subject until his naturalization as a British subject. As a result up to this point his official documents were in Russian. His knowledge of Russian was good enough that his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski wrote him advising that when Conrad came to visit he should telegraph for horses but in Russian for Oratów doesnt receive or accept messages in an alien language. Conrad chose however to write his fiction in English. He says in his preface to A Personal Record that writing in English was for him natural and that the idea of his having made a deliberate choice between English and French as some had suggested was in error. He explained that though he had been familiar with French from childhood I would have been afraid to attempt expression in a language so perfectly crystallized. In 1915 as Jo Davidson sculpted his bust Conrad answered his question Ah to write French you have to know it. English is so plasticif you havent got a word you need you can make it but to write French you have to be an artist like Anatole France. These statements as so often in Conrads autobiographical writings are subtly disingenuous. In 1897 Conrad was visited by a fellow Pole the philosopher Wincenty Lutosławski who asked Conrad Why dont you write in Polish Lutosławski recalled Conrad explaining I value our beautiful Polish literature too much to bring into it my clumsy efforts. But for the English my gifts are sufficient and secure my daily bread. Conrad wrote in A Personal Record that English was the speech of my secret choice of my future of long friendships of the deepest affections of hours of toil and hours of ease and of solitary hours too of books read of thoughts pursued of remembered emotionsof my very dreams In 1878 Conrads four-year experience in the French merchant marine had been cut short when the French discovered he did not have a permit from the Imperial Russian consul to sail with the French. This and some typically disastrous Conradian investments had left him destitute and had precipitated a suicide attempt. With the concurrence of his mentor-uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski who had been summoned to Marseilles Conrad decided to seek employment with the British merchant marine which did not require Russias permission. Thus began Conrads sixteen years seafarers acquaintance with the British and with the English language. Had Conrad remained in the Francophone sphere or had he returned to Poland the son of the Polish poet playwright and translator Apollo Korzeniowskifrom childhood exposed to Polish and foreign literature and ambitious to himself become a writerhe might have ended up writing in French or Polish instead of English. Certainly his Uncle Tadeusz thought Conrad might write in Polish; in an 1881 letter he advised his 23-year-old nephew As thank God you do not forget your Polish... and your writing is not bad I repeat what I have... written and said beforeyou would do well to write... for Wędrowiec in Warsaw. We have few travelers and even fewer genuine correspondents the words of an eyewitness would be of great interest and in time would bring you... money. It would be an exercise in your native tonguethat thread which binds you to your country and countrymenand finally a tribute to the memory of your father who always wanted to and did serve his country by his pen. In the opinion of some biographers Conrads third language English remained under the influence of his first two languagesPolish and French. This makes his English seem unusual. Najder writes that Inevitably for a trilingual PolishFrenchEnglish-speaker Conrads writings occasionally show linguistic spillover Franglais or Poglishthe inadvertent use of French or Polish vocabulary grammar or syntax in his English writings. In one instance Najder uses several slips in vocabulary typical for Conrad and grammar as part of internal evidence against Conrads sometime literary collaborator Ford Madox Fords claim to have written a certain instalment of Conrads novel Nostromo for publication in T. P.s Weekly on behalf of an ill Conrad. The impracticality of working with a language which has long ceased to be ones principal language of daily use is illustrated by Conrads 1921 attempt at translating into English the Polish physicist columnist story-writer and comedy-writer Bruno Winawers short play The Book of Job. Najder writes As a practical matter by the time Conrad set about writing fiction he had little choice but to write in English. Poles who accused Conrad of cultural apostasy because he wrote in English instead of Polish missed the pointas do Anglophones who see in Conrads default choice of English as his artistic medium a testimonial to some sort of innate superiority of the English language. According to Conrads close friend and literary assistant Richard Curle the fact of Conrad writing in English was obviously misleading because Conrad is no more completely English in his art than he is in his nationality. Conrad according to Curle could never have written in any other language save the English language....for he would have been dumb in any other language but the English. Conrad always retained a strong emotional attachment to his native language. He asked his visiting Polish niece Karola Zagórska Will you forgive me that my sons dont speak Polish In June 1924 shortly before his death he apparently expressed a desire that his son John marry a Polish girl and learn Polish and toyed with the idea of returning for good to now independent Poland. Conrad bridled at being referred to as a Russian or Slavonic writer. The only Russian writer he admired was Ivan Turgenev. The critics he wrote an acquaintance on 31 January 1924 six months before his death detected in me a new note and as just when I began to write they had discovered the existence of Russian authors they stuck that label on me under the name of Slavonism. What I venture to say is that it would have been more just to charge me at most with Polonism. However though Conrad protested that Dostoyevsky was too Russian for me and that Russian literature generally was repugnant to me hereditarily and individuallyUnder Western Eyes is viewed as Conrads response to the themes explored in Dostoyevskys Crime and Punishment. Conrad had an awareness that in any language individual expressions words phrases sentences are fraught with connotations. He once wrote No English word has clean edges. All expressions he thought carried so many connotations as to be little more than instruments for exciting blurred emotions. This might help elucidate the impressionistic quality of many passages in his writings. It also explains why he chose to write his literary works not in Polish or French but in English with which for decades he had had the greatest contact. In 1975 the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe published an essay An Image of Africa Racism in Conrads Heart of Darkness which provoked controversy by calling Conrad a thoroughgoing racist. Achebes view was that Heart of Darkness cannot be considered a great work of art because it is a novel which celebrates... dehumanisation which depersonalises a portion of the human race. Referring to Conrad as a talented tormented man Achebe notes that Conrad reduces and degrades Africans to limbs ankles glistening white eyeballs etc. while simultaneously suspecting a common kinship between himself and these nativesleading Marlow to sneer the word ugly. Achebe also cited Conrads description of an encounter with an African A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind furious unreasoning rage as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days. Achebes essay a landmark in postcolonial discourse provoked debate and the questions it raised have been addressed in most subsequent literary criticism of Conrad. Achebes critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlows view from Conrads which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella. In their view Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically and refers sarcastically to and condemns outright the supposedly noble aims of European colonists thereby demonstrating his skepticism about the moral superiority of white men. Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained emaciated slaves the novelist remarks After all I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings. Some observers assert that Conrad whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers empathised by default with other subjugated peoples. Jeffrey Meyers notes that Conrad like his acquaintance Roger Casement was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress a dominant idea in Europe from the Renaissance to the Great War to attack the hypocritical justification of colonialism and to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa. Likewise E.D. Morel who led international opposition to King Leopold IIs rule in the Congo saw Conrads Heart of Darkness as a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as the most powerful thing written on the subject. More recently Nidesh Lawtoo complicated the race debate by showing that Conrads images of frenzy depict rituals of possession trance that are equally central to Achebes Things Fall Apart. Conrad scholar Peter Firchow writes that nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators personified or otherwise claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference. If Conrad or his novel is racist it is only in a weak sense since Heart of Darkness acknowledges racial distinctions but does not suggest an essential superiority of any group. Achebes reading of Heart of Darkness can be challenged by a reading of Conrads other African story An Outpost of Progress which has an omniscient narrator rather than the embodied narrator Marlow. Some younger scholars such as Masood Ashraf Raja have also suggested that if we read Conrad beyond Heart of Darkness especially his Malay novels racism can be further complicated by foregrounding Conrads positive representation of Muslims. In 1998 H.S. Zins wrote in Pula Botswana Journal of African Studies Conrad made English literature more mature and reflective because he called attention to the sheer horror of political realities overlooked by English citizens and politicians. The case of Poland his oppressed homeland was one such issue. The colonial exploitation of Africans was another. His condemnation of imperialism and colonialism combined with sympathy for its persecuted and suffering victims was drawn from his Polish background his own personal sufferings and the experience of a persecuted people living under foreign occupation. Personal memories created in him a great sensitivity for human degradation and a sense of moral responsibility. What gave was ready to distrust imperial conquerors who claimed they had the right to rule other peoples. Conrads experience in the Belgian-run Congo made him one of the fiercest critics of the white mans mission. It was also writes Najder Conrads most daring and last attempt to become a homo socialis a cog in the mechanism of society. By accepting the job in the trading company he joined for once in his life an organized large-scale group activity on land.... It is not accidental that the Congo expedition remained an isolated event in Conrads life. Until his death he remained a recluse in the social sense and never became involved with any institution or clearly defined group of people. Conrad was a Russian subject having been born in the Russian part of what had once been the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. After his fathers death Conrads uncle Bobrowski had attempted to secure Austrian citizenship for himto no avail probably because Conrad had not received permission from Russian authorities to remain abroad permanently and had not been released from being a Russian subject. Conrad could not return to Ukraine in the Russian Empirehe would have been liable to many years military service and as the son of political exiles to harassment. In a letter of 9 August 1877 Conrads uncle Bobrowski broached two important subjects the desirability of Conrads naturalisation abroad and Conrads plans to join the British merchant marine. Republics. Eventually Conrad would make his home in England. On 2 July 1886 he applied for British nationality which was granted on 19 August 1886. Yet in spite of having become a subject of Queen Victoria Conrad had not ceased to be a subject of Tsar Alexander III. To achieve his freedom from that subjection he had to make many visits to the Russian Embassy in London and politely reiterate his request. He would later recall the Embassys home at Belgrave Square in his novel The Secret Agent. Finally on 2 April 1889 the Russian Ministry of Home Affairs released the son of a Polish man of letters captain of the British merchant marine from the status of Russian subject. An anchor-shaped monument to Conrad at Gdynia on Polands Baltic Seacoast features a quotation from him in Polish Nic tak nie nęci nie rozczarowuje i nie zniewala jak życie na morzu . In Circular Quay Sydney Australia a plaque in a writers walk commemorates Conrads visits to Australia between 1879 and 1892. The plaque notes that Many of his works reflect his affection for that young continent. In San Francisco in 1979 a small triangular square at Columbus Avenue and Beach Street near Fishermans Wharf was dedicated as Joseph Conrad Square after Conrad. The squares dedication was timed to coincide with release of Francis Ford Coppolas Heart of Darkness-inspired film Apocalypse Now. Conrad does not appear to have ever visited San Francisco. In the latter part of World War II the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Danae was rechristened ORP Conrad and served as part of the Polish Navy. Notwithstanding the undoubted sufferings that Conrad endured on many of his voyages sentimentality and canny marketing place him at the best lodgings in several of his destinations. Hotels across the Far East still lay claim to him as an honoured guest with however no evidence to back their claims Singapores Raffles Hotel continues to claim he stayed there though he lodged in fact at the Sailors Home nearby. His visit to Bangkok also remains in that citys collective memory and is recorded in the official history of The Oriental Hotel along with that of a less well-behaved guest Somerset Maugham who pilloried the hotel in a short story in revenge for attempts to eject him. A plaque commemorating Joseph ConradKorzeniowski has been installed near Singapores Fullerton Hotel. Conrad is also reported to have stayed at Hong Kongs Peninsula Hotelat a port that in fact he never visited. Later literary admirers notably Graham Greene followed closely in his footsteps sometimes requesting the same room and perpetuating myths that have no basis in fact. No Caribbean resort is yet known to have claimed Conrads patronage although he is believed to have stayed at a Fort-de-France pension upon arrival in Martinique on his first voyage in 1875 when he travelled as a passenger on the Mont Blanc. In April 2013 a monument to Conrad was unveiled in the Russian town of Vologda where he and his parents lived in exile in 186263. The monument was removed with unclear explanation in June 2016. After the publication of Chance in 1913 Conrad was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship and his circle of friends which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications included authors and other leading lights in the arts such as Henry James Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham John Galsworthy Galsworthys wife Ada Galsworthy Edward Garnett Garnetts wife Constance Garnett Stephen Crane Hugh Walpole George Bernard Shaw H. G. Wells Arnold Bennett Norman Douglas Jacob Epstein T. E. Lawrence André Gide Paul Valéry Maurice Ravel Valery Larbaud Saint-John Perse Edith Wharton James Huneker anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski Józef Retinger . In the early 1900s Conrad composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford. In 1919 and 1922 Conrads growing renown and prestige among writers and critics in continental Europe fostered his hopes for a Nobel Prize in Literature. It was apparently the French and Swedesnot the Englishwho favoured Conrads candidacy. In April 1924 Conrad who possessed a hereditary Polish status of nobility and coat-of-arms declined a British knighthood offered by Labour Party Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Conrad kept a distance from official structureshe never voted in British national electionsand seems to have been averse to public honours generally; he had already refused honorary degrees from Cambridge Durham Edinburgh Liverpool and Yale universities. In the Polish Peoples Republic translations of Conrads works were openly published except for Under Western Eyes which in the 1980s was published as an underground bibuła. Conrads narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors including T. S. EliotMaria DąbrowskaF. Scott FitzgeraldWilliam FaulknerGerald Basil EdwardsErnest HemingwayAntoine de Saint-ExupéryAndré MalrauxGeorge OrwellGraham GreeneWilliam GoldingWilliam BurroughsSaul BellowGabriel García MárquezPeter MatthiessenJohn le CarréV. S. NaipaulPhilip RothJoan DidionThomas PynchonJ. M. Coetzee and Salman Rushdie. Many films have been adapted from or inspired by Conrads works. A striking portrait of Conrad aged about 46 was drawn by the historian and poet Henry Newbolt who met him about 1903 One thing struck me at oncethe extraordinary difference between his expression in profile and when looked at full face. s we sat in our little half-circle round the fire and talked on anything and everything I saw a third Conrad emergean artistic self sensitive and restless to the last degree. The more he talked the more quickly he consumed his cigarettes... And presently when I asked him why he was leaving London after... only two days he replied that... the crowd in the streets... terrified him. Terrified By that dull stream of obliterated faces He leaned forward with both hands raised and clenched. Yes terrified I see their personalities all leaping out at me like tigers He acted the tiger well enough almost to terrify his hearers but the moment after he was talking again wisely and soberly as if he were an average Englishman with not an irritable nerve in his body. On 12 October 1912 American music critic James Huneker visited Conrad and later recalled being received by a man of the world neither sailor nor novelist just a simple-mannered gentleman whose welcome was sincere whose glance was veiled at times far-away whose ways were French Polish anything but literary bluff or English. After respective separate visits to Conrad in August and September 1913 two British aristocrats the socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell and the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russellwho were lovers at the timerecorded their impressions of the novelist. In her diary Morrell wrote I found Conrad himself standing at the door of the house ready to receive me.... seemed a nice and good-looking fat creature an excellent cook ... a good and reposeful mattress for this hypersensitive nerve-wracked man who did not ask from his wife high intelligence only an assuagement of lifes vibrations.... He made me feel so natural and very much myself that I was almost afraid of losing the thrill and wonder of being there although I was vibrating with intense excitement inside .... His eyes under their pent-house lids revealed the suffering and the intensity of his experiences; when he spoke of his work there came over them a sort of misty sensuous dreamy look but they seemed to hold deep down the ghosts of old adventures and experiencesonce or twice there was something in them one almost suspected of being wicked.... But then I believe whatever strange wickedness would tempt this super-subtle Pole he would be held in restraint by an equally delicate sense of honour.... In his talk he led me along many paths of his life but I felt that he did not wish to explore the jungle of emotions that lay dense on either side and that his apparent frankness had a great reserve. A month later Bertrand Russell visited Conrad at Capel House in Orlestone and the same day on the train wrote down his impressions It was wonderfulI loved him I think he liked me. He talked a great deal about his work life aims about other writers.... Then we went for a little walk somehow grew very intimate. I plucked up courage to tell him what I find in his workthe boring down into things to get to the very bottom below the apparent facts. He seemed to feel I had understood him; then I stopped we just looked into each others eyes for some time then he said he had grown to wish he could live on the surface and write differently that he had grown frightened. His eyes at the moment expressed the inward pain terror that one feels him always fighting.... Then he talked a lot about Poland showed me an album of family photographs of the 60sspoke about how dream-like all that seems how he sometimes feels he ought not to have had any children because they have no roots or traditions or relations. Russells Autobiography published over half a century later in 1968 confirms his original experience My first impression was one of surprise. He spoke English with a very strong foreign accent and nothing in his demeanour in any way suggested the sea. He was an aristocratic Polish gentleman to his fingertips.... At our very first meeting we talked with continually increasing intimacy. We seemed to sink through layer after layer of what was superficial till gradually both reached the central fire. It was an experience unlike any other... I have known. We looked into each others eyes half appalled and half intoxicated to find ourselves together in such a region. The emotion was as intense as passionate love and at the same time all-embracing. I came away bewildered and hardly able to find my way among ordinary affairs. It was not only Anglophones who remarked Conrads strong foreign accent when speaking English. After French poet Paul Valéry and French composer Maurice Ravel made Conrads acquaintance in December 1922 Valéry wrote in 1924 of having been astonished at Conrads horrible accent in English. The subsequent friendship and correspondence between Conrad and Russell lasted with long intervals to the end of Conrads life. In one letter Conrad avowed his deep admiring affection which if you were never to see me again and forget my existence tomorrow will be unalterably yours usque ad finem. Conrad in his correspondence often used the Latin expression meaning to the very end which he seems to have adopted from his faithful guardian mentor and benefactor his maternal uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski. Conrad looked with less optimism than Russell on the possibilities of scientific and philosophic knowledge. In a 1913 letter to acquaintances who had invited Conrad to join their society he reiterated his belief that it was impossible to understand the essence of either reality or life both science and art penetrate no further than the outer shapes. Najder describes Conrad as n alienated émigré... haunted by a sense of the unreality of other people a feeling natural to someone living outside the established structures of family social milieu and country. Throughout almost his entire life Conrad was an outsider and felt himself to be one. An outsider in exile; an outsider during his visits to his family in... Poland; an outsiderbecause of his experiences and bereavementin and Lwów; an outsider in Marseilles; an outsider nationally and culturally on British ships; an outsider as an English writer. Conrads sense of loneliness throughout his life in exile found memorable expression in the 1901 short story Amy Foster. A number of works in various genres and media have been based on or inspired by Conrads writings including
W. B. Yeats,William Butler Yeats was an Irish poet dramatist writer and politician. One of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature in the English-speaking canon he was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival and became a pillar of the Irish literary establishment who helped to found the Abbey Theatre. In his later years he served two terms as a Senator of the Irish Free State. A Protestant of Anglo-Irish descent Yeats was born in Sandymount Ireland. He was educated in Dublin and London and spent childhood holidays in County Sligo. He studied poetry from an early age when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. He was influenced by John Keats William Wordsworth William Blake and many more. These topics feature in the first phase of his work lasting roughly from his student days at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889 and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser Percy Bysshe Shelley and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900 his poetry grew more physical realistic and politicised. He moved away from the transcendental beliefs of his youth though he remained preoccupied with some elements including cyclical theories of life. He had become the chief playwright for the Irish Literary Theatre in 1897 and early on promoted younger poets such as Ezra Pound. Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923. His major later works include 1928s The Tower and Words for Music Perhaps and Other Poems published in 1932. William Butler Yeats was born in Sandymount in County Dublin Ireland. His father John Butler Yeats was a descendant of Jervis Yeats a Williamite soldier linen merchant and well-known painter who died in 1712. Benjamin Yeats Jerviss grandson and Williams great-great-grandfather had in 1773 married Mary Butler of a landed family in County Kildare. Following their marriage they kept the name Butler. Mary was of the Butler of Neigham Gowran family descended from an illegitimate brother of The 8th Earl of Ormond. At the time of his marriage his father John was studying law but later pursued art studies at Heatherley School of Fine Art in London. Williams mother Susan Mary Pollexfen from Sligo came from a wealthy merchant family who owned a milling and shipping business. Soon after Williams birth the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville Sligo to stay with her extended family and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became over time both personally and symbolically his country of the heart. So too did its location by the sea; John Yeats stated that by marriage with a Pollexfen we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs. The Butler Yeats family were highly artistic; his brother Jack became an esteemed painter while his sisters Elizabeth and Susan Maryknown to family and friends as Lollie and Lilybecame involved in the Arts and Crafts movement. Yeats was raised a member of the Protestant Ascendancy which was at the time undergoing a crisis of identity. While his family was supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997 his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleons dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty is manifestly true of W.B.Y. Yeatss childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism while the Irish Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his countrys biography. In 1867 the family moved to England to aid their father John to further his career as an artist. At first the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby Slough countryside. On 26 January 1877 the young poet entered the Godolphin School which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically and an early school report describes his performance as only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling. Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to Bedford Park taking a two-year lease at 8 Woodstock Road. For financial reasons the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880 living at first in the suburbs of Harolds Cross and later in Howth. In October 1881 Yeats resumed his education at Dublins Erasmus Smith High School. His fathers studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there where he met many of the citys artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry and in 1885 the Dublin University Review published Yeatss first poems as well as an essay entitled The Poetry of Sir Samuel Ferguson. Between 1884 and 1886 William attended the Metropolitan School of Artnow the National College of Art and Designin Thomas Street. In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park where they would remain until 1902. The rent on the house in 1888 was 50 a year. He began writing his first works when he was seventeen; these included a poemheavily influenced by Percy Bysshe Shelleythat describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop a monk and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and according to the critic Charles Johnston utterly unIrish seeming to come out of a vast murmurous gloom of dreams. Although Yeatss early works drew heavily on Shelley Edmund Spenser and on the diction and colouring of pre-Raphaelite verse he soon turned to Irish mythology and folklore and the writings of William Blake. In later life Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan. In 1891 Yeats published John Sherman and Dhoya one a novella the other a story. The influence of Oscar Wilde is evident in Yeatss theory of aesthetics especially in his stage plays and runs like a motif through his early works. The theory of masks developed by Wilde in his polemic The Decay of Lying can clearly be seen in Yeatss play The Player Queen while the more sensual characterisation of Salomé in Wildes play of the same name provides the template for the changes Yeats made in his later plays especially in On Bailes Strand Deirdre and his dance play The King of the Great Clock Tower . The family returned to London in 1887. In March 1890 Yeats joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and with Ernest Rhys co-founded the Rhymers Club a group of London-based poets who met regularly in a Fleet Street tavern to recite their verse. Yeats later sought to mythologize the collective calling it the Tragic Generation in his autobiography and published two anthologies of the Rhymers work the first one in 1892 and the second one in 1894. He collaborated with Edwin Ellis on the first complete edition of William Blakes works in the process rediscovering a forgotten poem Vala or the Four Zoas. Yeats had a lifelong interest in mysticism spiritualism occultism and astrology. He read extensively on the subjects throughout his life became a member of the paranormal research organisation The Ghost Club and was influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892 he wrote If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write. His mystical interestsalso inspired by a study of Hinduism under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee and the occultformed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeatss work. His first significant poem was The Island of Statues a fantasy work that took Edmund Spenser and Shelley for its poetic models. The piece was serialized in the Dublin University Review. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection but it was deemed too long and in fact was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet Mosada A Dramatic Poem which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains in the words of his biographer R. F. Foster obscure Gaelic names striking repetitions an unremitting rhythm subtly varied as the poem proceeded through its three sections We rode in sorrow with strong hounds threeBran Sceolan and LomairOn a morning misty and mild and fair.The mist-drops hung on the fragrant treesAnd in the blossoms hung the bees.We rode in sadness above Lough LeanFor our best were dead on Gavras green. During 1885 Yeats was involved in the formation of the Dublin Hermetic Order. That year the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin Mohini Chatterjee who travelled from the Theosophical Society in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first séance the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophy and with hermeticism particularly with the eclectic Rosicrucianism of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. During séances held from 1912 a spirit calling itself Leo Africanus apparently claimed it was Yeatss Daemon or anti-self inspiring some of the speculations in Per Amica Silentia Lunae. He was admitted into the Golden Dawn in March 1890 and took the magical motto translated as Devil is God inverted. He was an active recruiter for the sects Isis-Urania Temple and brought in his uncle George Pollexfen Maud Gonne and Florence Farr. Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults he was attracted to the type of people he met at the Golden Dawn. He was involved in the Orders power struggles both with Farr and Macgregor Mathers and was involved when Mathers sent Aleister Crowley to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the Battle of Blythe Road. After the Golden Dawn ceased and splintered into various offshoots Yeats remained with the Stella Matutina until 1921. In 1889 Yeats met Maud Gonne a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish nationalist. She was eighteen months younger than Yeats and later claimed she met the poet as a paint-stained art student. Gonne admired The Island of Statues and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation and she had a significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted it seems to me that she brought into my life those daysfor as yet I saw only what lay upon the surfacethe middle of the tint a sound as of a Burmese gong an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes. Yeatss love was unrequited in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism. In 1891 he visited Gonne in Ireland and proposed marriage but was rejected. He later admitted that from that point the troubling of my life began. Yeats proposed to Gonne three more times in 1899 1900 and 1901. She refused each proposal and in 1903 to his dismay married the Irish nationalist Major John MacBride. His only other love affair during this period was with Olivia Shakespear whom he first met in 1894 and parted from in 1897. Yeats derided MacBride in letters and in poetry. He was horrified by Gonnes marriage at losing his muse to another man; in addition her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended him; Yeats was Protestantagnostic. He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding. Gonnes marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son Seán MacBride in 1904 Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage although they were unable to agree on the childs welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main second though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights. In 1895 Yeats moved into number 5 Woburn Walk and resided there until 1919. Yeatss friendship with Gonne ended yet in Paris in 1908 they finally consummated their relationship. The long years of fidelity rewarded at last was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul. The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation they could not continue as they had been I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest loving you as I do I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too. By January 1909 Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem A Man Young and Old My arms are like the twisted thornAnd yet there beauty lay;The first of all the tribe lay thereAnd did such pleasure take;She who had brought great Hector downAnd put all Troy to wreck. In 1896 Yeats was introduced to Lady Gregory by their mutual friend Edward Martyn. Gregory encouraged Yeatss nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French Symbolism Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory Martyn and other writers including J. M. Synge Seán OCasey and Padraic Colum Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the Irish Literary Revival movement. Apart from these creative writers much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was Douglas Hyde later the first President of Ireland whose Love Songs of Connacht was widely admired. In 1899 Yeats Lady Gregory Edward Martyn and George Moore founded the Irish Literary Theatre to promote Irish plays. The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre which sought to express the ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager à langlais. The groups manifesto which Yeats wrote declared We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory... that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed. Yeatss interest in the classics and his defiance of English censorship were also fueled by a tour of America he took between 1903 and 1904. Stopping to deliver a lecture at the University of Notre Dame he learned about the student production of the Oedipus Rex. This play was banned in England an act he viewed as hypocritical as denounced as part of British Puritanism. He contrasted this with the artistic freedom of the Catholicism found at Notre Dame which had allowed such a play with themes such as incest and parricide. He desired to stage a production of the Oedipus Rex in Dublin. The collective survived for about two years but was unsuccessful. Working with the Irish brothers with theatrical experience William and Frank Fay Yeatss unpaid but independently wealthy secretary Annie Horniman and the leading West End actress Florence Farr the group established the Irish National Theatre Society. Along with Synge they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the Abbey Theatre. Yeatss play Cathleen ni Houlihan and Lady Gregorys Spreading the News were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902 he helped set up the Dun Emer Press to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the Cuala Press in 1904 and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement sought to find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things. From then until its closure in 1946 the presswhich was run by the poets sistersproduced over 70 titles; 48 of them books by Yeats himself. Yeats met the American poet Ezra Pound in 1909. Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man whom he considered the only poet worthy of serious study. From 1913 until 1916 the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at Ashdown Forest with Pound nominally acting as Yeatss secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine Poetry of some of Yeatss verse with Pounds own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pounds distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese Noh plays that Pound had obtained from Ernest Fenollosas widow which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was At the Hawks Well the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916. The emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of Easter 1916 Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the Easter Rising due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives. Yeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park County Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem The Wild Swans at Coole was written there between 1916 and 1917. He wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales compiled by Lady Gregory Cuchulain of Muirthemne and Gods and Fighting Men . In the preface of the latter he wrote One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments the many incidents woven into one great event of let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne. Yeats was an Irish nationalist who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as The Fisherman. But as his life progressed he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the intense political landscape until 1922 when he was appointed Senator for the Irish Free State. In the earlier part of his life Yeats was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian anti-democratic nationalist movements of Europe and he composed several marching songs for the Blueshirts although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. He was an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership. By 1916 Yeats was 51 years old and determined to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed for his role in the 1916 Easter Rising so Yeats hoped that his widow Maud Gonne might remarry. His final proposal to Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonnes history of revolutionary political activism as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her lifeincluding chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBridemade her a potentially unsuitable wife; biographer R. F. Foster has observed that Yeatss last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her. Yeats proposed in an indifferent manner with conditions attached and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter. Iseult Gonne was Mauds second child with Lucien Millevoye and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mothers adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride. When Gonne took action to divorce MacBride in 1905 the court heard allegations that he had sexually assaulted Iseult then eleven. At fifteen she proposed to Yeats. In 1917 he proposed to Iseult but was rejected. That September Yeats proposed to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees known as George whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friendsGeorge... you cant. He must be deadHyde-Lees accepted and the two were married on 20 October 1917. Their marriage was a success in spite of the age difference and in spite of Yeatss feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women Georgie herself wrote to her husband When you are dead people will talk about your love affairs but I shall say nothing for I will remember how proud you were. During the first years of marriage they experimented with automatic writing; she contacted a variety of spirits and guides they called Instructors while in a trance. The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes phases cones and gyres. Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as A Vision . In 1924 he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie admitting I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books. In December 1923 Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his always inspired poetry which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation. Politically aware he knew the symbolic value of an Irish winner so soon after Ireland had gained independence and highlighted the fact at each available opportunity. His reply to many of the letters of congratulations sent to him contained the words I consider that this honour has come to me less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature it is part of Europes welcome to the Free State. Yeats used the occasion of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English travelling companies and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was romantic and poetical because the nationalism we had called upthe nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragementwas romantic and poetical. The prize led to a significant increase in the sales of his books as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money and he was able to repay not only his own debts but those of his father. By early 1925 Yeatss health had stabilised and he had completed most of the writing for A Vision . He had been appointed to the first Irish Senate in 1922 and was re-appointed for a second term in 1925. Early in his tenure a debate on divorce arose and Yeats viewed the issue as primarily a confrontation between the emerging Roman Catholic ethos and the Protestant minority. When the Roman Catholic Church weighed in with a blanket refusal to consider their anti position The Irish Times countered that a measure to outlaw divorce would alienate Protestants and crystallise the partition of Ireland. In response Yeats delivered a series of speeches that attacked the quixotically impressive ambitions of the government and clergy likening their campaign tactics to those of medieval Spain. Marriage is not to us a Sacrament but upon the other hand the love of a man and woman and the inseparable physical desire are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry. The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeatss supreme public moments and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation. His language became more forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay was described by Yeats as a man of monstrous discourtesy and he lamented that It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that we have put our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation. During his time in the Senate Yeats further warned his colleagues If you show that this country southern Ireland is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone you will never get the North... You will put a wedge in the midst of this nation. He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants we are no petty people. In 1924 he chaired a coinage committee charged with selecting a set of designs for the first currency of the Irish Free State. Aware of the symbolic power latent in the imagery of a young states currency he sought a form that was elegant racy of the soil and utterly unpolitical. When the house finally decided on the artwork of Percy Metcalfe Yeats was pleased though he regretted that compromise had led to lost muscular tension in the finally depicted images. He retired from the Senate in 1928 because of ill health. Towards the end of his lifeand especially after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and Great Depression which led some to question whether democracy could cope with deep economic difficultyYeats seems to have returned to his aristocratic sympathies. During the aftermath of the First World War he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule. His later association with Pound drew him towards Benito Mussolini for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions. He wrote three marching songsnever usedfor the Irish General Eoin ODuffys Blueshirts. At the age of 69 he was rejuvenated by the Steinach operation which was performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For the last five years of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with among others the poet and actress Margot Ruddock and the novelist journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy and despite age and ill-health he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935 Yeats noted I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done. In 1936 he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse 18921935. From 1935 to 1936 he travelled to the Western Mediterranean island of Majorca with Indian-born Shri Purohit Swami and from there the two of them performed the majority of the work in translating the principal Upanishads from Sanskrit into common English; the resulting work The Ten Principal Upanishads was published in 1938. He died at the Hôtel Idéal Séjour in Menton France on 28 January 1939 aged 73. He was buried after a discreet and private funeral at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Attempts had been made at Roquebrune to dissuade the family from proceeding with the removal of the remains to Ireland due to the uncertainty of their identity. His body had earlier been exhumed and transferred to the ossuary. Yeats and George had often discussed his death and his express wish was that he be buried quickly in France with a minimum of fuss. According to George His actual words were If I die bury me up there and then in a years time when the newspapers have forgotten me dig me up and plant me in Sligo. In September 1948 Yeatss body was moved to the churchyard of St Columbas Church Drumcliff County Sligo on the Irish Naval Service corvette LÉ Macha. The person in charge of this operation for the Irish Government was Seán MacBride son of Maud Gonne MacBride and then Minister of External Affairs. His epitaph is taken from the last lines of Under Ben Bulben one of his final poems Cast a cold EyeOn Life on Death.Horseman pass by French ambassador Stanislas Ostroróg was involved in returning the remains of the poet from France to Ireland in 1948; in a letter to the European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris Ostrorog tells how Yeatss son Michael sought official help in locating the poets remains. Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected Ostrorog notes. He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed. Yeatss body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to an ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poets remains were thrown into a communal grave causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. Per a letter from Ostroróg to his superiors Mr Rebouillat forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased. Yeats is considered one of the key twentieth-century English-language poets. He was a Symbolist poet using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that in addition to a particular meaning they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other perhaps immaterial timeless qualities. Unlike the modernists who experimented with free verse Yeats was a master of the traditional forms. The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period comprising the volumes In the Seven Woods Responsibilities and The Green Helmet. His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter as well as meditations on the experience of growing old. In his poem The Circus Animals Desertion he describes the inspiration for these late works Now that my ladders goneI must lie down where all the ladders startIn the foul rag and bone shop of the heart. During 1929 he stayed at Thoor Ballylee near Gort in County Galway for the last time. Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland although he did lease Riversdale house in the Dublin suburb of Rathfarnham in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years and published poetry plays and prose. In 1938 he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play Purgatory. His Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats was published that same year. The preface for the English translation of Rabindranath Tagores Gitanjali was written by Yeats in 1913. While Yeatss early poetry drew heavily on Irish myth and folklore his later work was engaged with more contemporary issues and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone self-consciously ornate and at times according to unsympathetic critics stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as The Isle of Statues and The Wanderings of Oisin. His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeatss middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work and attempt to turn himself into a Landor-style social ironist. Critics characterize his middle work as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist while others find the poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeatss later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of spiritualism. In many ways this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul. Some critics hold that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as Pablo Picasso did in painting; others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot variety. Modernists read the well-known poem The Second Coming as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation but it also expresses Yeatss apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with The Green Helmet and Responsibilities . In imagery Yeatss poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. The Tower The Winding Stair and New Poems contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry. Yeatss mystical inclinations informed by Hinduism theosophical beliefs and the occult provided much of the basis of his late poetry which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeatss late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision . Yeats is commemorated in Sligo town by a statue created in 1989 by sculptor Rowan Gillespie. On the 50th anniversary of the poets death it was erected outside the Ulster Bank at the corner of Stephen Street and Markievicz Road. Yeats had remarked on receiving his Nobel Prize that the Royal Palace in Stockholm resembled the Ulster Bank in Sligo. Across the river is the Yeats Memorial Building home to the Sligo Yeats Society.Standing Figure Knife Edge by Henry Moore is displayed in the W. B. Yeats Memorial Garden at St Stephens Green in Dublin. There is a blue plaque dedicated to Yeats at Balscadden House on the Balscadden Road in Howth. This was his cottage home from 1880-1883. In 1957 the London County Council erected a plaque at his former residence on 23 Fitzroy Road Primrose Hill London. Composer Marcus Paus choral work The Stolen Child is based on poetry by Yeats. Critic Stephen Eddins described it as sumptuously lyrical and magically wild and the alluring mystery and danger and melancholy of Yeats. Argentine composer Julia Stilman-Lasansky based her cantata No. 4 on text by Yeats.
Virginia Woolf,Adeline Virginia Woolf was an English writer. She is considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. Woolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington London the seventh child of Julia Prinsep Jackson and Leslie Stephen in a blended family of eight that included the modernist painter Vanessa Bell. She was home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature from a young age. From 1897 to 1901 she attended the Ladies Department of Kings College London where she studied classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of womens higher education and the womens rights movement. Encouraged by her father Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. After her fathers death in 1904 the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury where in conjunction with the brothers intellectual friends they formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group. In 1912 she married Leonard Woolf and in 1917 the couple founded the Hogarth Press which published much of her work. They rented a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. Woolf had romantic relationships with women. One female lover was Vita Sackville-West whose books Woolf published through Hogarth Press. Both womens literature became inspired by their relationship which lasted until Woolfs death. During the inter-war period Woolf was an important part of Londons literary and artistic society. In 1915 she published her first novel The Voyage Out through her half-brothers publishing house Gerald Duckworth and Company. Her best-known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway To the Lighthouse and Orlando . She is also known for her essays such as A Room of Ones Own . Woolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism. Her works translated into more than 50 languages have attracted attention and widespread commentary for inspiring feminism. A large body of writing is dedicated to her life and work. She has been the subject of plays novels and films. Woolf is commemorated by statues societies dedicated to her work and a building at the University of London. Throughout her life Woolf was troubled by mental illness. She was institutionalised several times and attempted suicide at least twice. According to Dalsimer her illness was characterised by symptoms that would later be diagnosed as bipolar disorder for which there was no effective treatment during her lifetime. In 1941 at the age of 59 Woolf died by drowning herself in the River Ouse at Lewes. Virginia Woolf was born Adeline Virginia Stephen on 25 January 1882 at 22 Hyde Park Gate in South Kensington London to Julia and Sir Leslie Stephen writer historian essayist biographer and mountaineer. Julia Jackson was born in 1846 in Calcutta British India to John Jackson and Maria Mia Theodosia Pattle from two Anglo-Indian families. John Jackson FRCS was the third son of George Jackson and Mary Howard of Bengal a physician who spent 25 years with the Bengal Medical Service and East India Company and a professor at the fledgling Calcutta Medical College. While John Jackson was an almost invisible presence the Pattle family were famous beauties and moved in the upper circles of Bengali society. The seven Pattle sisters married into important families. Julia Margaret Cameron was a celebrated photographer while Virginia married Earl Somers and their daughter Julia Jacksons cousin was Lady Henry Somerset the temperance leader. Julia moved to England with her mother at the age of two and spent much of her early life with another of her mothers sisters Sarah Monckton Pattle. Sarah and her husband Henry Thoby Prinsep conducted an artistic and literary salon at Little Holland House where she came into contact with a number of Pre-Raphaelite painters such as Edward Burne-Jones for whom she modelled. Julia was the youngest of three sisters and Adeline Virginia was named after her mothers eldest sister Adeline Maria Jackson and her mothers aunt Virginia Pattle . Because of the tragedy of her aunt Adelines death the previous year the family never used Virginias first name. The Jacksons were a well educated literary and artistic proconsular middle-class family. In 1867 Julia Jackson married Herbert Duckworth a barrister but within three years was left a widow with three infant children. She was devastated and entered a prolonged period of mourning abandoning her faith and turning to nursing and philanthropy. Julia and Herbert Duckworth had three children Leslie Stephen was born in 1832 in South Kensington to Sir James and Lady Jane Catherine Stephen daughter of John Venn rector of Clapham. The Venns were the centre of the evangelical Clapham Sect. Sir James Stephen was the under secretary at the Colonial Office and with another Clapham member William Wilberforce was responsible for the passage of the Slavery Abolition Bill in 1833. In 1849 he was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge. As a family of educators lawyers and writers the Stephens represented the elite intellectual aristocracy. While his family were distinguished and intellectual they were less colourful and aristocratic than Julia Jacksons. A graduate and fellow of Cambridge University he renounced his faith and position to move to London where he became a notable man of letters. In addition he was a rambler and mountaineer described as a gaunt figure with the ragged red brown beard...a formidable man with an immensely high forehead steely-blue eyes and a long pointed nose. In the same year as Julia Jacksons marriage he wed Harriet Marian Thackeray youngest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray who bore him a daughter Laura but died in childbirth in 1875. Laura was developmentally disabled and eventually institutionalized. The widowed Julia Duckworth knew Leslie Stephen through her friendship with Minnys elder sister Anne Isabella Ritchie and had developed an interest in his agnostic writings. She was present the night Minny died and later tended to Leslie Stephen and helped him move next door to her on Hyde Park Gate so Laura could have some companionship with her own children. Both were preoccupied with mourning and although they developed a close friendship and intense correspondence agreed it would go no further. Leslie Stephen proposed to her in 1877 an offer she declined but when Anny married later that year she accepted him and they were married on 26 March 1878. He and Laura then moved next door into Julias house where they lived till his death in 1904. Julia was 32 and Leslie was 46. Their first child Vanessa was born on 30 May 1879. Julia having presented her husband with a child and now having five children to care for decided to limit her familys growth. However despite the fact that the couple took precautions contraception was a very imperfect art in the nineteenth century it resulted in the birth of three more children over the next four years. Virginia Woolf provides insight into her early life in her autobiographical essays including Reminiscences 22 Hyde Park Gate and A Sketch of the Past . Other essays that provide insight into this period include Leslie Stephen . She also alludes to her childhood in her fictional writing. In To the Lighthouse her depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse they would visit there. However Woolfs understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940 in which the somewhat distant yet revered figure of her mother becomes more nuanced and filled in. In February 1891 with her sister Vanessa Woolf began the Hyde Park Gate News chronicling life and events within the Stephen family and modelled on the popular magazine Tit-Bits. Initially this was mainly Vanessas and Thobys articles but very soon Virginia became the main contributor with Vanessa as editor. Their mothers response when it first appeared was Rather clever I think. Virginia would run the Hyde Park Gate News until 1895 the time of her mothers death. The following year the Stephen sisters also used photography to supplement their insights as did Stella Duckworth. Vanessa Bells 1892 portrait of her sister and parents in the Library at Talland House was one of the familys favourites and was written about lovingly in Leslie Stephens memoir. In 1897 Virginia began her first diary which she kept for the next twelve years and a notebook in 1909. Virginia was as she describes it born into a large connection born not of rich parents but of well-to-do parents born into a very communicative literate letter writing visiting articulate late nineteenth century world. It was a well-connected family consisting of six children with two half brothers and a half sister another half sister Laura and an older sister Vanessa and brother Thoby. The following year another brother Adrian followed. The disabled Laura Stephen lived with the family until she was institutionalized in 1891. Julia and Leslie had four children together Virginia was born at 22 Hyde Park Gate and lived there until her fathers death in 1904. Number 22 Hyde Park Gate South Kensington lay at the south-east end of Hyde Park Gate a narrow cul-de-sac running south from Kensington Road just west of the Royal Albert Hall and opposite Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park where the family regularly took their walks . Built in 1846 by Henry Payne of Hammersmith as one of a row of single-family townhouses for the upper middle class it soon became too small for their expanding family. At the time of their marriage it consisted of a basement two storeys and an attic. In July 1886 Leslie Stephen obtained the services of J.W. Penfold an architect to add additional living space above and behind the existing structure. The substantial renovations added a new top floor with three bedrooms and a study for himself converted the original attic into rooms and added the first bathroom. It was a tall but narrow townhouse that at that time had no running water. Virginia would later describe it as a very tall house on the left-hand side near the bottom which begins by being stucco and ends by being red brick; which is so high and yetas I can say now that we have sold itso rickety that it seems as if a very high wind would topple it over. The servants worked downstairs in the basement. The ground floor had a drawing room separated by a curtain from the servants pantry and a library. Above this on the first floor were Julia and Leslies bedrooms. On the next floor were the Duckworth childrens rooms and above them the day and night nurseries of the Stephen children occupied two further floors. Finally in the attic under the eaves were the servants bedrooms accessed by a back staircase. Life at 22 Hyde Park Gate was also divided symbolically; as Virginia put it The division in our lives was curious. Downstairs there was pure convention upstairs pure intellect. But there was no connection between them the worlds typified by George Duckworth and Leslie Stephen. Their mother it seems was the only one who could span this divide. The house was described as dimly lit and crowded with furniture and paintings. Within it the younger Stephens formed a close-knit group. Despite this the children still held their grievances. Virginia envied Adrian for being their mothers favourite. Virginia and Vanessas status as creatives caused a rivalry between them at times. Life in London differed sharply from their summers in Cornwall their outdoor activities consisting mainly of walks in nearby Kensington Gardens where they would play hide-and-seek and sail their boats on the Round Pond while indoors it revolved around their lessons. Leslie Stephens eminence as an editor critic and biographer and his connection to William Thackeray meant his children were raised in an environment filled with the influences of a Victorian literary society. Henry James George Henry Lewes Alfred Lord Tennyson Thomas Hardy Edward Burne-Jones and Virginias honorary godfather James Russell Lowell were among the visitors to the house. Julia Stephen was equally well connected. Her aunt was a pioneering early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron who was also a visitor to the Stephen household. The two Stephen sisters Vanessa and Virginia were almost three years apart in age. Virginia christened her older sister the saint and was far more inclined to exhibit her cleverness than her more reserved sister. Virginia resented the domesticity Victorian tradition forced on them far more than her sister. They also competed for Thobys affections. Virginia would later confess her ambivalence over this rivalry to Duncan Grant in 1917 indeed one of the concealed worms of my life has been a sisters jealousy of a sister I mean; and to feed this I have invented such a myth about her that I scarce know one from tother. Virginia showed an early affinity for writing. Although both parents disapproved of formal education for females writing was considered a respectable profession for women and her father encouraged her in this respect. Later she would describe this as ever since I was a little creature scribbling a story in the manner of Hawthorne on the green plush sofa in the drawing room at St. Ives while the grown-ups dined. By the age of five she was writing letters and could tell her father a story every night. Later she Vanessa and Adrian would develop the tradition of inventing a serial about their next-door neighbours every night in the nursery or in the case of St. Ives of spirits that resided in the garden. It was her fascination with books that formed the strongest bond between her and her father. For her tenth birthday she received an ink-stand a blotter drawing book and a box of writing implements. Leslie Stephen was in the habit of hiking in Cornwall and in the spring of 1881 he came across a large white house in St Ives Cornwall and took out a lease on it that September. Although it had limited amenities its main attraction was the view overlooking Porthminster Bay towards the Godrevy Lighthouse which the young Virginia could see from the upper windows and was to be the central figure in her To the Lighthouse . It was a large square house with a terraced garden divided by hedges sloping down towards the sea. Each year between 1882 and 1894 from mid-July to mid-September the Stephen family leased Talland House as a summer residence. Leslie Stephen who referred to it thus a pocket-paradise described it as The pleasantest of my memories... refer to our summers all of which were passed in Cornwall especially to the thirteen summers at St Ives. There we bought the lease of Talland House a small but roomy house with a garden of an acre or two all up and down hill with quaint little terraces divided by hedges of escallonia a grape-house and kitchen-garden and a so-called orchard beyond. It was in Leslies words a place of intense domestic happiness. Virginia herself described the house in great detail In both London and Cornwall Julia was perpetually entertaining and was notorious for her manipulation of her guests lives constantly matchmaking in the belief everyone should be married the domestic equivalence of her philanthropy. As her husband observed My Julia was of course though with all due reserve a bit of a matchmaker. Amongst their guests in 1893 were the Brookes whose children including Rupert Brooke played with the Stephen children. Rupert and his group of Cambridge Neo-pagans would come to play an important role in their lives in the years before the First World War. While Cornwall was supposed to be a summer respite Julia Stephen soon immersed herself in the work of caring for the sick and poor there as well as in London. Both at Hyde Park Gate and Talland House the family mingled with much of the countrys literary and artistic circles. Frequent guests included literary figures such as Henry James and George Meredith as well as James Russell Lowell and the children were exposed to much more intellectual conversations than at their mothers Little Holland House. The family did not return following Julia Stephens death in May 1895. For the children it was the highlight of the year and Virginias most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of Cornwall. In a diary entry of 22 March 1921 she described why she felt so connected to Talland House looking back to a summer day in August 1890. Why am I so incredibly and incurably romantic about Cornwall Ones past I suppose; I see children running in the garden ... The sound of the sea at night ... almost forty years of life all built on that permeated by that so much I could never explain. Cornwall inspired aspects of her work in particular the St Ives Trilogy of Jacobs Room To the Lighthouse and The Waves . Julia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895 and never properly recovered dying on 5 May when Virginia was 13. It was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness. Essentially her life had fallen apart. The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mothers death and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer rather than return to the memories of St Ives the Stephens went to Freshwater Isle of Wight where some of their mothers relatives lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mothers role in caring for Virginias mental state. Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897 making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister. George Duckworth also assumed some of their mothers role taking upon himself the task of bringing them out into society. First Vanessa then Virginia in both cases an equal disaster for it was not a rite of passage that resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by Virginia regarding the conventional expectations of young upper-class women Society in those days was a perfectly competent perfectly complacent ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires say to paint or to write could be taken seriously. Rather her priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a room of ones own to pursue her writing aspirations. She would revisit this criticism in her depiction of Mrs. Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse an unmarried woman has missed the best of life. The death of Stella Duckworth on 19 July 1897 after a long illness was a further blow to Virginias sense of self and the family dynamics. Woolf described the period following the death of both her half-sister Stella and her father as 18971904 the seven unhappy years referring to the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed the two people who should normally and naturally have made those years not perhaps happy but normal and natural. In April 1902 their father became ill and although he underwent surgery later that year he never fully recovered dying on 22 February 1904. Virginias fathers death precipitated a further breakdown. Later Virginia would describe this time as one in which she was dealt successive blows as a broken chrysalis with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in Woolfs writing but the broken chrysalis was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between Woolf and grief. At his death Leslie Stephens net worth was 15715 6s. 6d.  Even today there may be parents who would doubt the wisdom of allowing a girl of fifteen the free run of a large and quite unexpurgated library. But my father allowed it. There were certain facts very briefly very shyly he referred to them. Yet Read what you like he said and all his books...were to be had without asking. Later between the ages of 15 and 19 Virginia was able to pursue higher education. She took courses of study some at degree level in beginning and advanced Ancient Greek intermediate Latin and German together with continental and English history at the Ladies Department of Kings College London at nearby 13 Kensington Square between 1897 and 1901. She studied Greek under the eminent scholar George Charles Winter Warr professor of Classical Literature at Kings. In addition she had private tutoring in German Greek and Latin. One of her Greek tutors was Clara Pater who taught at Kings. Another was Janet Case who involved her in the womens rights movement and whose obituary Virginia would later write in 1937. Her experiences led to her 1925 essay On Not Knowing Greek. Her time at Kings also brought her into contact with some of the early reformers of womens higher education such as the principal of the Ladies Department Lilian Faithfull in addition to Pater. Her sister Vanessa also enrolled at the Ladies Department . Although the Stephen girls could not attend Cambridge they were to be profoundly influenced by their brothers experiences there. When Thoby went to Trinity in 1899 he befriended a circle of young men including Clive Bell Lytton Strachey Leonard Woolf and Saxon Sydney-Turner whom he would soon introduce to his sisters at the Trinity May Ball in 1900. These men formed a reading group they named the Midnight Society. Although Virginia expressed the opinion that her father was her favourite parent and although she had only turned thirteen when her mother died she was profoundly influenced by her mother throughout her life. It was Virginia who famously stated that for we think back through our mothers if we are women and invoked the image of her mother repeatedly throughout her life in her diaries her letters and a number of her autobiographical essays including Reminiscences 22 Hyde Park Gate and A Sketch of the Past frequently evoking her memories with the words I see her .... She also alludes to her childhood in her fictional writing. In To the Lighthouse the artist Lily Briscoe attempts to paint Mrs. Ramsay a complex character based on Julia Stephen and repeatedly comments on the fact that she was astonishingly beautiful. Her depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse they would visit there. However Woolfs understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940 in which the somewhat distant yet revered figure becomes more nuanced and complete. While her father painted Julia Stephens work in terms of reverence Woolf drew a sharp distinction between her mothers work and the mischievous philanthropy which other women practise so complacently and often with such disastrous results. She describes her degree of sympathy engagement judgement and decisiveness and her sense of both irony and the absurd. She recalls trying to recapture the clear round voice or the sight of the beautiful figure so upright and distinct in its long shabby cloak with the head held at a certain angle so that the eye looked straight out at you. Julia Stephen dealt with her husbands depressions and his need for attention which created resentment in her children boosted his self-confidence nursed her parents in their final illness and had many commitments outside the home that would eventually wear her down. Her frequent absences and the demands of her husband instilled a sense of insecurity in her children that had a lasting effect on her daughters. In considering the demands on her mother Woolf described her father as fifteen years her elder difficult exacting dependent on her and reflected that it was at the expense of the amount of attention she could spare her young children a general presence rather than a particular person to a child. She reflected that she rarely ever spent a moment alone with her mother someone was always interrupting. Woolf was ambivalent about it yet eager to separate herself from this model of utter selflessness. In To the Lighthouse she describes it as boasting of her capacity to surround and protect there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by; all was so lavished and spent. At the same time she admired the strengths of her mothers womanly ideals. Given Julias frequent absences and commitments the young Stephen children became increasingly dependent on Stella Duckworth who emulated her mothers selflessness; as Woolf wrote Stella was always the beautiful attendant handmaid ... making it the central duty of her life. Julia Stephen greatly admired her husbands intellect. As Woolf observed she never belittled her own works thinking them if properly discharged of equal though other importance with her husbands. She believed with certainty in her role as the centre of her activities and the person who held everything together with a firm sense of what was important and valuing devotion. Of the two parents Julias nervous energy dominated the family. While Virginia identified most closely with her father Vanessa stated her mother was her favourite parent.Angelica Garnett recalls how Virginia asked Vanessa which parent she preferred although Vanessa considered it a question that one ought not to ask she was unequivocal in answering Mother yet the centrality of her mother to Virginias world is expressed in this description of her Certainly there she was in the very centre of that great Cathedral space which was childhood; there she was from the very first. Virginia observed that her half-sister Stella the oldest daughter led a life of total subservience to her mother incorporating her ideals of love and service. Virginia like her father quickly learned that being ill was the only reliable way of gaining the attention of her mother who prided herself on her sickroom nursing. Another issue the children had to deal with was Leslie Stephens temper Woolf describing him as the tyrant father. Eventually she became deeply ambivalent about him. He had given her his ring on her eighteenth birthday and she had a deep emotional attachment as his literary heir writing about her great devotion for him. Yet like Vanessa she also saw him as victimiser and tyrant. She had a lasting ambivalence towards him through her life albeit one that evolved. Her adolescent image was of an Eminent Victorian and tyrant but as she grew older she began to realise how much of him was in her I have been dipping into old letters and fathers memoirs....so candid and reasonable and transparentand had such a fastidious delicate mind educated and transparent she wrote 22 December 1940. She was in turn both fascinated and condemnatory of Leslie Stephen She has haunted me but then so did that old wretch my father. . . . I was more like him than her I think; and therefore more critical but he was an adorable man and somehow tremendous. Woolf stated that she first remembers being molested by Gerald Duckworth when she was six years old. It has been suggested that this led to a lifetime of sexual fear and resistance tomasculine authority. Against a background of over-committed and distant parents suggestions that this was a dysfunctional family must be evaluated. These include evidence of sexual abuse of the Stephen girls by their older Duckworth half-brothers and by their cousin James Kenneth Stephen at least of Stella Duckworth. Laura is also thought to have been abused. The most graphic account is by Louise DeSalvo but other authors and reviewers have been more cautious. Virginias accounts of being continually sexually abused during the time that she lived at 22 Hyde Park Gate have been cited by some critics as a possible cause of her mental health issues although there are likely to be a number of contributing factors. Hermione Lee states that The evidence is strong enough and yet ambiguous enough to open the way for conflicting psychobiographical interpretations that draw quite different shapes of Virginia Woolfs interior life. On their fathers death the Stephens first instinct was to escape from the dark house of yet more mourning and this they did immediately accompanied by George travelling to Manorbier on the coast of Pembrokeshire on 27 February. There they spent a month and it was there that Virginia first came to realise her destiny was as a writer as she recalls in her diary of 3 September 1922. They then further pursued their newfound freedom by spending April in Italy and France where they met up with Clive Bell again. Virginia then suffered her second nervous breakdown and first suicidal attempt on 10 May and convalesced over the next three months. Before their father died the Stephens had discussed the need to leave South Kensington in the West End with its tragic memories and their parents relations. George Duckworth was 35 his brother Gerald 33. The Stephen children were now between 24 and 20. Virginia was 22. Vanessa and Adrian decided to sell 22 Hyde Park Gate in respectable South Kensington and move to Bloomsbury. Bohemian Bloomsbury with its characteristic leafy squares seemed sufficiently far away geographically and socially and was a much cheaper neighbourhood rentwise. They had not inherited much and they were unsure about their finances. Also Bloomsbury was close to the Slade School which Vanessa was then attending. While Gerald was quite happy to move on and find himself a bachelor establishment George who had always assumed the role of quasi-parent decided to accompany them much to their dismay. It was then that Lady Margaret Herbert appeared on the scene George proposed was accepted and married in September leaving the Stephens to their own devices. Vanessa found a house at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury and they moved in November to be joined by Virginia now sufficiently recovered. It was at Gordon Square that the Stephens began to regularly entertain Thobys intellectual friends in March 1905. The circle which largely came from the Cambridge Apostles included writers and critics with Thursday evening At Homes that became known as the Thursday Club a vision of recreating Trinity College . This circle formed the nucleus of the intellectual circle of writers and artists known as the Bloomsbury Group. Later it would include John Maynard Keynes Duncan Grant E.M. Forster Roger Fry Leonard Woolf and David Garnett . The following year 1906 Virginia suffered two further losses. Her cherished brother Thoby who was only 26 died of typhoid following a trip they had all taken to Greece and immediately afterward Vanessa accepted Clives third proposal. Vanessa and Clive were married in February 1907 and as a couple their interest in avant-garde art would have an important influence on Woolfs further development as an author. With Vanessas marriage Virginia and Adrian needed to find a new home. Virginia moved into 29 Fitzroy Square in April 1907 a house on the west side of the street formerly occupied by George Bernard Shaw. It was in Fitzrovia immediately to the west of Bloomsbury but still relatively close to her sister at Gordon Square. The two sisters continued to travel together visiting Paris in March. Adrian was now to play a much larger part in Virginias life and they resumed the Thursday Club in October at their new home while Gordon Square became the venue for the Play Reading Society in December. During this period the group began to increasingly explore progressive ideas first in speech and then in conduct Vanessa proclaiming in 1910 a libertarian society with sexual freedom for all. Meanwhile Virginia began work on her first novel Melymbrosia that eventually became The Voyage Out . Vanessas first child Julian was born in February 1908 and in September Virginia accompanied the Bells to Italy and France. It was during this time that Virginias rivalry with her sister resurfaced flirting with Clive which he reciprocated and which lasted on and off from 1908 to 1914 by which time her sisters marriage was breaking down. On 17 February 1909 Lytton Strachey proposed to Virginia and she accepted but he then withdrew the offer. It was while she was at Fitzroy Square that the question arose of Virginia needing a quiet country retreat and she required a six-week rest cure and sought the countryside away from London as much as possible. In December she and Adrian stayed at Lewes and started exploring the area of Sussex around the town. She started to want a place of her own like St Ives but closer to London. She soon found a property in nearby Firle maintaining a relationship with that area for the rest of her life. Several members of the group attained notoriety in 1910 with the Dreadnought hoax which Virginia participated in disguised as a male Abyssinian royal. Her complete 1940 talk on the hoax was discovered and is published in the memoirs collected in the expanded edition of The Platform of Time . In October 1911 the lease on Fitzroy Square was running out and Virginia and Adrian decided to give up their home on Fitzroy Square in favour of a different living arrangement moving to a four-storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper in November. Virginia saw it as a new opportunity We are going to try all kinds of experiments she told Ottoline Morrell. Adrian occupied the second floor with Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant sharing the ground floor. This arrangement for a single woman was considered scandalous and George Duckworth was horrified. The house was adjacent to the Foundling Hospital much to Virginias amusement as an unchaperoned single woman. Originally Ka Cox was supposed to share in the arrangements but opposition came from Rupert Brooke who was involved with her and pressured her to abandon the idea. At the house Duncan Grant decorated Adrian Stephens rooms . Leonard Woolf was one of Thoby Stephens friends at Trinity College Cambridge and noticed the Stephen sisters in Thobys rooms there on their visits to the May Ball in 1900 and 1901. He recalls them in white dresses and large hats with parasols in their hands their beauty literally took ones breath away. To him they were silent formidable and alarming. Woolf did not meet Virginia formally till 17 November 1904 when he dined with the Stephens at Gordon Square to say goodbye before leaving to take up a position with the civil service in Ceylon although she was aware of him through Thobys stories. At that visit he noted that she was perfectly silent throughout the meal and looked ill. In 1909 Lytton Strachey suggested to Woolf he should make her an offer of marriage. He did so but received no answer. In June 1911 he returned to London on a one-year leave but did not go back to Ceylon. In England again Leonard renewed his contacts with family and friends. Three weeks after arriving he dined with Vanessa and Clive Bell at Gordon Square on 3 July where they were later joined by Virginia and other members of what would later be called Bloomsbury and Leonard dates the groups formation to that night. In September Virginia asked Leonard to join her at Little Talland House at Firle in Sussex for a long weekend. After that weekend they began seeing each other more frequently. On 4 December 1911 Leonard moved into the ménage on Brunswick Square occupying a bedroom and sitting room on the fourth floor and started to see Virginia constantly and by the end of the month had decided he was in love with her. On 11 January 1912 he proposed to her; she asked for time to consider so he asked for an extension of his leave and on being refused offered his resignation on 25 April effective 20 May. He continued to pursue Virginia and in a letter of 1 May 1912 she explained why she did not favour a marriage. However on 29 May Virginia told Leonard that she wished to marry him and they were married on 10 August at the St Pancras Register Office. It was during this time that Leonard first became aware of Virginias precarious mental state. The Woolfs continued to live at Brunswick Square until October 1912 when they moved to a small flat at 13 Cliffords Inn further to the east . Despite his low material status the couple shared a close bond. Indeed in 1937 Woolf wrote in her diary Love-makingafter 25 years cant bear to be separate ... you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted a wife. And our marriage so complete. However Virginia made a suicide attempt in 1913. In October 1914 Leonard and Virginia Woolf moved away from Bloomsbury and central London to Richmond living at 17 The Green a home discussed by Leonard in his autobiography Beginning Again . In early March 1915 the couple moved again to nearby Hogarth House Paradise Road after which they named their publishing house. Virginias first novel The Voyage Out was published in 1915 followed by another suicide attempt. Despite the introduction of conscription in 1916 Leonard was exempted on medical grounds. Leonard and Virginia employed two servants at the recommendation of Roger Fry in 1916. Nellie Boxall would stay with them for eighteen years. Nellies difficult relationship with her boss. Between 1924 and 1940 the Woolfs returned to Bloomsbury taking out a ten-year lease at 52 Tavistock Square from where they ran the Hogarth Press from the basement where Virginia also had her writing room and is commemorated with a bust of her in the square . 1925 saw the publication of Mrs Dalloway in May followed by her collapse while at Charleston in August. In 1927 her next novel To the Lighthouse was published and the following year she lectured on Women Fiction at Cambridge University and published Orlando in October. Her two Cambridge lectures then became the basis for her major essay A Room of Ones Own in 1929. Virginia wrote only one drama Freshwater based on her great-aunt Julia Margaret Cameron and produced at her sisters studio on Fitzroy Street in 1935. 1936 saw another collapse of her health following the completion of The Years. The Woolfs final residence in London was at 37 Mecklenburgh Square destroyed during the Blitz in September 1940; a month later their previous home on Tavistock Square was also destroyed. After that they made Sussex their permanent home. For descriptions and illustrations of all Virginia Woolfs London homes see Jean Moorcroft Wilsons book Virginia Woolf Life and London A Biography of Place . Virginia had taken up book-binding as a pastime in October 1901 at the age of 19 and the Woolfs had been discussing setting up a publishing house for some time and at the end of 1916 started making plans. Having discovered that they were not eligible to enroll in the St Bride School of Printing they started purchasing supplies after seeking advice from the Excelsior Printing Supply Company on Farringdon Road in March 1917 and soon they had a printing press set up on their dining room table at Hogarth House and the Hogarth Press was born. Their first publication was Two Stories in July 1917 inscribed Publication No. 1 and consisted of two short stories The Mark on the Wall by Virginia Woolf and Three Jews by Leonard Woolf. The work consisted of 32 pages hand bound and sewn and illustrated by woodcuts designed by Dora Carrington. The illustrations were a success leading Virginia to remark that the press was specially good at printing pictures and we see that we must make a practice of always having pictures. The process took two and a half months with a production run of 150 copies. Other short short stories followed including Kew Gardens with a woodblock by Vanessa Bell as frontispiece. Subsequently Bell added further illustrations adorning each page of the text. The press subsequently published Virginias novels along with works by T.S. Eliot Laurens van der Post and others. The Press also commissioned works by contemporary artists including Dora Carrington and Vanessa Bell. Woolf believed that to break free of a patriarchal society women writers needed a room of their own to develop and often fantasised about an Outsiders Society where women writers would create a virtual private space for themselves via their writings to develop a feminist critique of society. Though Woolf never created the Outsiders society the Hogarth Press was the closest approximation as the Woolfs chose to publish books by writers that took unconventional points of view to form a reading community. Initially the press concentrated on small experimental publications of little interest to large commercial publishers. Until 1930 Woolf often helped her husband print the Hogarth books as the money for employees was not there. Virginia relinquished her interest in 1938 following a third attempted suicide. After it was bombed in September 1940 the press was moved to Letchworth for the remainder of the war. Both the Woolfs were internationalists and pacifists who believed that promoting understanding between peoples was the best way to avoid another world war and chose quite consciously to publish works by foreign authors of whom the British reading public were unaware. The first non-British author to be published was the Soviet writer Maxim Gorky the book Reminiscences of Leo Nikolaiovich Tolstoy in 1920 dealing with his friendship with Count Leo Tolstoy. The ethos of the Bloomsbury group encouraged a liberal approach to sexuality and on 14 December 1922 Woolf met the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West wife of Harold Nicolson while dining with Clive Bell. Writing in her diary the next day she referred to meeting the lovely gifted aristocratic Sackville West. At the time Sackville-West was the more successful writer as both poet and novelist commercially and critically and it was not until after Woolfs death that she became considered the better writer. After a tentative start they began a sexual relationship which according to Sackville-West in a letter to her husband on 17 August 1926 was only twice consummated. The relationship reached its peak between 1925 and 1928 evolving into more of a friendship through the 1930s though Woolf was also inclined to brag of her affairs with other women within her intimate circle such as Sibyl Colefax and Comtesse de Polignac. This period of intimacy was to prove fruitful for both authors Woolf producing three novels To the Lighthouse Orlando and The Waves as well as a number of essays including Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown and A Letter to a Young Poet . Sackville-West worked tirelessly to lift Woolfs self-esteem encouraging her not to view herself as a quasi-reclusive inclined to sickness who should hide herself away from the world but rather offered praise for her liveliness and wit her health her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to reappraise herself developing a more positive self-image and the feeling that her writings were the products of her strengths rather than her weakness. Starting at the age of 15 Woolf had believed the diagnosis by her father and his doctor that reading and writing were deleterious to her nervous condition requiring a regime of physical labour such as gardening to prevent a total nervous collapse. This led Woolf to spend much time obsessively engaging in such physical labour. Sackville-West was the first to argue to Woolf she had been misdiagnosed and that it was far better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nervesadvice that was taken. Under the influence of Sackville-West Woolf learned to deal with her nervous ailments by switching between various forms of intellectual activities such as reading writing and book reviews instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength and worsened her nerves. Sackville-West chose the financially struggling Hogarth Press as her publisher to assist the Woolfs financially. Seducers in Ecuador the first of the novels by Sackville-West published by Hogarth was not a success selling only 1500 copies in its first year but the next Sackville-West novel they published The Edwardians was a best-seller that sold 30000 copies in its first six months. Sackville-Wests novels though not typical of the Hogarth Press saved Hogarth taking them from the red into the black. However Woolf was not always appreciative of the fact that it was Sackville-Wests books that kept the Hogarth Press profitable writing dismissively in 1933 of her servant girl novels. The financial security allowed by the good sales of Sackville-Wests novels in turn allowed Woolf to engage in more experimental work such as The Waves as Woolf had to be cautious when she depended upon Hogarth entirely for her income. In 1928 Woolf presented Sackville-West with Orlando a fantastical biography in which the eponymous heros life spans three centuries and both sexes. It was published in October shortly after the two women spent a week travelling together in France that September.Nigel Nicolson Vita Sackville-Wests son wrote The effect of Vita on Virginia is all contained in Orlando the longest and most charming love letter in literature in which she explores Vita weaves her in and out of the centuries tosses her from one sex to the other plays with her dresses her in furs lace and emeralds teases her flirts with her drops a veil of mist around her. After their affair ended the two women remained friends until Woolfs death in 1941. Virginia Woolf also remained close to her surviving siblings Adrian and Vanessa; Thoby had died of typhoid fever at the age of 26. Virginia was needing a country retreat to escape to and on 24 December 1910 she found a house for rent in Firle Sussex near Lewes . She obtained a lease and took possession of the house the following month naming it Little Talland House after their childhood home in Cornwall although it was actually a new red gabled villa on the main street opposite the village hall. The lease was a short one and in October she and Leonard Woolf found Asham House at Asheham a few miles to the west while walking along the Ouse from Firle. The house at the end of a tree-lined road was a strange beautiful Regency-Gothic house in a lonely location. She described it as flat pale serene yellow-washed without electricity or water and allegedly haunted. She took out a five-year lease jointly with Vanessa in the New Year and they moved into it in February 1912 holding a house warming party on the 9th. It was at Asham that the Woolfs spent their wedding night later that year. At Asham she recorded the events of the weekends and holidays they spent there in her Asham Diary part of which was later published as A Writers Diary in 1953. In terms of creative writing The Voyage Out was completed there and much of Night and Day. Asham provided Woolf with well needed relief from the pace of London life and was where she found a happiness that she expressed in her diary of 5 May 1919 Oh but how happy weve been at Asheham It was a most melodious time. Everything went so freely; but I cant analyse all the sources of my joy. Asham was also the inspiration for A Haunted House and was painted by members of the Bloomsbury Group including Vanessa Bell and Roger Fry. It was during these times at Asham that Ka Cox started to devote herself to Virginia and become very useful. While at Asham Leonard and Virginia found a farmhouse in 1916 that was to let about four miles away which they thought would be ideal for her sister. Eventually Vanessa came down to inspect it and moved in in October of that year taking it as a summer home for her family. The Charleston Farmhouse was to become the summer gathering place for the literary and artistic circle of the Bloomsbury Group. After the end of the war in 1918 the Woolfs were given a years notice by the landlord who needed the house. In mid-1919 in despair they purchased a very strange little house for 300 the Round House in Pipe Passage Lewes a converted windmill. No sooner had they bought the Round House than Monks House in nearby Rodmell came up for auction a weatherboarded house with oak beamed rooms said to be 15th or 16th century. The Leonards favoured the latter because of its orchard and garden and sold the Round House to purchase Monks House for 700. Monks House also lacked water and electricity but came with an acre of garden and had a view across the Ouse towards the hills of the South Downs. Leonard Woolf describes this view as being unchanged since the days of Chaucer. From 1940 it became their permanent home after their London home was bombed and Virginia continued to live there until her death. Meanwhile Vanessa made Charleston her permanent home in 1936. It was at Monks House that Virginia completed Between the Acts in early 1941 followed by a further breakdown directly resulting in her suicide on 28 March 1941 the novel being published posthumously later that year. During her time in Firle Virginia became better acquainted with Rupert Brooke and his social circle nicknamed the Neo-Pagans pursuing socialism vegetarianism exercising outdoors and alternative life styles including social nudity. They were influenced by the ethos of Bedales Fabianism and Shelley. The women wore sandals socks open neck shirts and head-scarves. Although she had some reservations Woolf was involved with their activities for a while fascinated by their bucolic innocence in contrast to the sceptical intellectualism of Bloomsbury which earned her the nickname The Goat from her brother Adrian. While Woolf liked to make much of a weekend she spent with Brooke at the vicarage in Grantchester including swimming in the pool there it appears to have been principally a literary assignation. They also shared a psychiatrist in the name of Maurice Craig. Through the Neo-Pagans she finally met Ka Cox on a weekend in Oxford in January 1911 who had been part of the Friday Club circle and now became her friend and played an important part in dealing with her illnesses. Virginia nicknamed her Bruin. At the same time she found herself dragged into a triangular relationship involving Ka Jacques Raverat and Gwen Darwin. She became resentful of the other couple Jacques and Gwen who married later in 1911 not the outcome Virginia had predicted or desired. They would later be referred to in both To the Lighthouse and The Years. The exclusion she felt evoked memories of both Stella Duckworths marriage and her triangular involvement with Vanessa and Clive. The two groups eventually fell out. Brooke pressured Ka into withdrawing from joining Virginias ménage on Brunswick Square in late 1911 calling it a bawdy-house and by the end of 1912 he had vehemently turned against Bloomsbury. Later she would write sardonically about Brooke whose premature death resulted in his idealisation and express regret about the Neo-Paganism at that stage of my life. Virginia was deeply disappointed when Ka married William Edward Arnold-Forster in 1918 and became increasingly critical of her. Much examination has been made of Woolfs mental health . From the age of 13 following the death of her mother Woolf suffered periodic mood swings from severe depression to manic excitement including psychotic episodes which the family referred to as her madness. However as Hermione Lee points out Woolf was not mad; she was merely a woman who suffered from and struggled with illness for much of her life a woman of exceptional courage intelligence and stoicism who made the best use and achieved the best understanding she could of that illness. Modern psychiatrists contend that her illness constituted bipolar disorder . Her mothers death in 1895 the greatest disaster that could happen precipitated a crisis of alternating excitability and depression accompanied by irrational fears for which their family doctor Dr. Seton prescribed rest stopping lessons and writing and regular walks supervised by Stella. Yet just two years later Stella too was dead bringing on her next crisis in 1897 and her first expressed wish for death at the age of fifteen writing in her diary that October that death would be shorter less painful. She then stopped keeping a diary for some time. This was a scenario she would later recreate in Time Passes . The death of her father in 1904 provoked her most alarming collapse on 10 May when she threw herself out a window and she was briefly institutionalised under the care of her fathers friend the eminent psychiatrist George Savage. Savage blamed her educationfrowned on by many at the time as unsuitable for womenfor her illness. She spent time recovering at the house of Stellas friend Violet Dickinson and at her aunt Carolines house in Cambridge and by January 1905 Dr. Savage considered her cured. Violet seventeen years older than Virginia became one of her closest friends and one of her more effective nurses. She characterised it as a romantic friendship . Her brother Thobys death in 1906 marked a decade of deaths that ended her childhood and adolescence. Gordon writes Ghostly voices spoke to her with increasing urgency perhaps more real than the people who lived by her side. When voices of the dead urged her to impossible things they drove her mad but controlled they became the material of fiction... On Dr. Savages recommendation Virginia spent three short periods in 1910 1912 and 1913 at Burley House at 15 Cambridge Park Twickenham described as a private nursing home for women with nervous disorder run by Miss Jean Thomas. By the end of February 1910 she was becoming increasingly restless and Dr. Savage suggested being away from London. Vanessa rented Moat House outside Canterbury in June but there was no improvement so Dr. Savage sent her to Burley for a rest cure. This involved partial isolation deprivation of literature and force-feeding and after six weeks she was able to convalesce in Cornwall and Dorset during the autumn. She loathed the experience; writing to her sister on 28 July she described how she found the phony religious atmosphere stifling and the institution ugly and informed Vanessa that to escape I shall soon have to jump out of a window. The threat of being sent back would later lead to her contemplating suicide. Despite her protests Savage would refer her back in 1912 for insomnia and in 1913 for depression. On emerging from Burley House in September 1913 she sought further opinions from two other physicians on the 13th Maurice Wright and Henry Head who had been Henry Jamess physician. Both recommended she return to Burley House. Distraught she returned home and attempted suicide by taking an overdose of 100 grains of veronal and nearly dying she was found by Ka Cox who summoned help. On recovery she went to Dalingridge Hall George Duckworths home in East Grinstead Sussex to convalesce on 30 September accompanied by Ka Cox and a nurse returning to Asham on 18 November with Cox and Janet Case. She remained unstable over the next two years with another incident involving veronal that she claimed was an accident and consulted another psychiatrist in April 1914 Maurice Craig who explained that she was not sufficiently psychotic to be certified or committed to an institution. The rest of the summer of 1914 went better for her and they moved to Richmond but in February 1915 just as The Voyage Out was due to be published she relapsed once more and remained in poor health for most of that year. Then despite Miss Thomass gloomy prognosis she began to recover following 20 years of ill health. Nevertheless there was a feeling among those around her that she was now permanently changed and not for the better. Over the rest of her life she suffered recurrent bouts of depression. In 1940 a number of factors appeared to overwhelm her. Her biography of Roger Fry had been published in July and she had been disappointed in its reception. The horrors of war depressed her and their London homes had been destroyed in the Blitz in September and October. Woolf had completed Between the Acts in November and completing a novel was frequently accompanied by exhaustion. Her health became increasingly a matter of concern culminating in her decision to end her life on 28 March 1941. Though this instability would frequently affect her social life she was able to continue her literary productivity with few interruptions throughout her life. Woolf herself provides not only a vivid picture of her symptoms in her diaries and letters but also her response to the demons that haunted her and at times made her long for death But it is always a question whether I wish to avoid these glooms... These 9 weeks give one a plunge into deep waters... One goes down into the well nothing protects one from the assault of truth. Psychiatry had little to offer Woolf but she recognised that writing was one of the behaviours that enabled her to cope with her illness The only way I keep afloat... is by working... Directly I stop working I feel that I am sinking down down. And as usual I feel that if I sink further I shall reach the truth. Sinking under water was Woolfs metaphor for both the effects of depression and psychosis but also for finding truth and ultimately was her choice of death. Throughout her life Woolf struggled without success to find meaning in her illness on the one hand an impediment on the other something she visualised as an essential part of who she was and a necessary condition of her art. Her experiences informed her work such as the character of Septimus Warren Smith in Mrs Dalloway who like Woolf was haunted by the dead and ultimately takes his own life rather than be admitted to a sanitorium. Leonard Woolf relates how during the 30 years they were married they consulted many doctors in the Harley Street area and although they were given a diagnosis of neurasthenia he felt they had little understanding of the causes or nature. The proposed solution was simpleas long as she lived a quiet life without any physical or mental exertion she was well. On the other hand any mental emotional or physical strain resulted in a reappearance of her symptoms beginning with a headache followed by insomnia and thoughts that started to race. Her remedy was simple to retire to bed in a darkened room eat and drink plenty of milk following which the symptoms slowly subsided. Modern scholars including her nephew and biographer Quentin Bell have suggested her breakdowns and subsequent recurring depressive periods were influenced by the sexual abuse which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected to by their half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth . Biographers point out that when Stella died in 1897 there was no counterbalance to control Georges predation and his nighttime prowling. Virginia describes him as her first lover The old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia never knew that George Duckworth was not only father and mother brother and sister to those poor Stephen girls; he was their lover also. It is likely that other factors also played a part. It has been suggested that they include genetic predisposition for both trauma and family history have been implicated in bipolar disorder. Virginias father Leslie Stephen suffered from depression and her half-sister Laura was institutionalised. Many of Virginias symptoms including persistent headache insomnia irritability and anxiety resembled those of her fathers. Another factor is the pressure she placed upon herself in her work; for instance her breakdown of 1913 was at least partly triggered by the need to finish The Voyage Out. Virginia herself hinted that her illness was related to how she saw the repressed position of women in society when she wrote A Room of Ones Own. In the piece she asserts that had Shakespeare had a sister of equal genius she would certainly have gone crazed shot herself or ended her days in some lonely cottage outside the village half witch half wizard feared and mocked at. These inspirations emerged from what Woolf referred to as her lava of madness describing her time at Burley in a 1930 letter to Ethel Smyth As an experience madness is terrific I can assure you and not to be sniffed at; and in its lava I still find most of the things I write about. It shoots out of one everything shaped final not in mere driblets as sanity does. And the six monthsnot threethat I lay in bed taught me a good deal about what is called oneself. Thomas Caramagno and others in discussing her illness oppose the neurotic-genius way of looking at mental illness where creativity and mental illness are conceptualised as linked rather than antithetical.Stephen Trombley describes Woolf as having a confrontational relationship with her doctors and possibly being a woman who is a victim of male medicine referring to the lack of understanding particularly at the time about mental illness. After completing the manuscript of her last novel Between the Acts Woolf fell into a depression similar to one which she had earlier experienced. The onset of World War II the destruction of her London home during the Blitz and the cool reception given to her biography of her late friend Roger Fry all worsened her condition until she was unable to work. When Leonard enlisted in the Home Guard Virginia disapproved. She held fast to her pacifism and criticised her husband for wearing what she considered to be the silly uniform of the Home Guard. After World War II began Woolfs diary indicates that she was obsessed with death which figured more and more as her mood darkened. On 28 March 1941 Woolf drowned herself by filling her overcoat pockets with stones and walking into the River Ouse near her home. Her body was not found until 18 April. Her husband buried her cremated remains beneath an elm tree in the garden of Monks House their home in Rodmell Sussex. In her suicide note addressed to her husband she wrote DearestI feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we cant go through another of those terrible times. And I shant recover this time. I begin to hear voices and I cant concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I dont think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I cant fight it any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I cant even write this properly. I cant read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say thateverybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I cant go on spoiling your life any longer. I dont think two people could have been happier than we have been. V. Woolf is considered to be one of the more important 20th century novelists. A modernist she was one of the pioneers of using stream of consciousness as a narrative device alongside contemporaries such as Marcel ProustDorothy Richardson and James Joyce. Woolfs reputation was at its greatest during the 1930s but declined considerably following World War II. The growth of feminist criticism in the 1970s helped re-establish her reputation. Virginia submitted her first article in 1890 to a competition in Tit-Bits. Although it was rejected this shipboard romance by the 8-year-old would presage her first novel 25 years later as would contributions to the Hyde Park News such as the model letter to show young people the right way to express what is in their hearts a subtle commentary on her mothers legendary matchmaking. She transitioned from juvenilia to professional journalism in 1904 at the age of 22. Violet Dickinson introduced her to Mrs. Lyttelton the editor of the Womens Supplement of The Guardian a Church of England newspaper. Invited to submit a 1500-word article Virginia sent Lyttelton a review of William Dean Howells The Son of Royal Langbirth and an essay about her visit to Haworth that year Haworth November 1904. The review was published anonymously on 4 December and the essay on the 21st. In 1905 Woolf began writing for The Times Literary Supplement. Woolf would go on to publish novels and essays as a public intellectual to both critical and popular acclaim. Much of her work was self-published through the Hogarth Press. Virginia Woolfs peculiarities as a fiction writer have tended to obscure her central strength she is arguably the major lyrical novelist in the English language. Her novels are highly experimental a narrative frequently uneventful and commonplace is refractedand sometimes almost dissolvedin the characters receptive consciousness. Intense lyricism and stylistic virtuosity fuse to create a world overabundant with auditory and visual impressions. The intensity of Virginia Woolfs poetic vision elevates the ordinary sometimes banal settingsoften wartime environmentsof most of her novels. Her first novel The Voyage Out was published in 1915 at the age of 33 by her half-brothers imprint Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd. This novel was originally titled Melymbrosia but Woolf repeatedly changed the draft. An earlier version of The Voyage Out has been reconstructed by Woolf scholar Louise DeSalvo and is now available to the public under the intended title. DeSalvo argues that many of the changes Woolf made in the text were in response to changes in her own life. The novel is set on a ship bound for South America and a group of young Edwardians onboard and their various mismatched yearnings and misunderstandings. In the novel are hints of themes that would emerge in later work including the gap between preceding thought and the spoken word that follows and the lack of concordance between expression and underlying intention together with how these reveal to us aspects of the nature of love. Orlando A Biography is one of Virginia Woolfs lightest novels. A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty the book is in part a portrait of Woolfs lover Vita Sackville-West. It was meant to console Vita for the loss of her ancestral home Knole House though it is also a satirical treatment of Vita and her work. In Orlando the techniques of historical biographers are being ridiculed; the character of a pompous biographer is being assumed for it to be mocked. Flush A Biography is a part-fiction part-biography of the cocker spaniel owned by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The book is written from the dogs point of view. Woolf was inspired to write this book from the success of the Rudolf Besier play The Barretts of Wimpole Street. In the play Flush is on stage for much of the action. The Years traces the history of the genteel Pargiter family from the 1880s to the present day of the mid-1930s. The novel had its origin in a lecture Woolf gave to the National Society for Womens Service in 1931 an edited version of which would later be published as Professions for Women. Woolf first thought of making this lecture the basis of a new book-length essay on women this time taking a broader view of their economic and social life rather than focusing on women as artists as the first book had. She soon jettisoned the theoretical framework of her novel-essay and began to rework the book solely as a fictional narrative but some of the non-fiction material she first intended for this book was later used in Three Guineas . Woolfs fiction has been studied for its insight into many themes including war shell shock witchcraft and the role of social class in contemporary modern British society. In the postwar Mrs Dalloway Woolf addresses the moral dilemma of war and its effects and provides an authentic voice for soldiers returning from World War I suffering from shell shock in the person of Septimus Smith. In A Room of Ones Own Woolf equates historical accusations of witchcraft with creativity and genius among women When however one reads of a witch being ducked of a woman possessed by devils...then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist a suppressed poet of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen. Throughout her work Woolf tried to evaluate the degree to which her privileged background framed the lens through which she viewed class. She both examined her own position as someone who would be considered an elitist snob but attacked the class structure of Britain as she found it. In her 1936 essay Am I a Snob she examined her values and those of the privileged circle she existed in. She concluded she was and subsequent critics and supporters have tried to deal with the dilemma of being both elite and a social critic. The sea is a recurring motif in Woolfs work. Noting Woolfs early memory of listening to waves break in Cornwall Katharine Smyth writes in The Paris Review that the radiance cresting water would be consecrated again and again in her writing saturating not only essays diaries and letters but also Jacobs Room The Waves and To the Lighthouse. Patrizia A. Muscogiuri explains that seascapes sailing diving and the sea itself are aspects of nature and of human beings relationship with it which frequently inspired Virginia Woolfs writing. This trope is deeply embedded in her texts structure and grammar; James Antoniou notes in Sydney Morning Herald how Woolf made a virtue of the semicolon the shape and function of which resembles the wave her most famous motif. Despite the considerable conceptual difficulties given Woolfs idiosyncratic use of language her works have been translated into over 50 languages. Some writers such as the Belgian Marguerite Yourcenar had rather tense encounters with her while others such as the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges produced versions that were highly controversial. Virginia Woolf researched the life of her great-aunt the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron publishing her findings in an essay titled Pattledom and later in her introduction to her 1926 edition of Camerons photographs. She had begun work on a play based on an episode in Camerons life in 1923 but abandoned it. Finally it was performed on 18 January 1935 at the studio of her sister Vanessa Bell on Fitzroy Street in 1935. Woolf directed it herself and the cast were mainly members of the Bloomsbury Group including herself. Freshwater is a short three act comedy satirising the Victorian era only performed once in Woolfs lifetime. Beneath the comedic elements there is an exploration of both generational change and artistic freedom. Both Cameron and Woolf fought against the class and gender dynamics of Victorianism and the play shows links to both To the Lighthouse and A Room of Ones Own that would follow. Woolf wrote a body of autobiographical work and more than 500 essays and reviews some of which like A Room of Ones Own were of book length. Not all were published in her lifetime. Shortly after her death Leonard Woolf produced an edited edition of unpublished essays titled The Moment and other Essays published by the Hogarth Press in 1947. Many of these were originally lectures that she gave and several more volumes of essays followed such as The Captains Death Bed and other essays . Among Woolfs non-fiction works one of the best known is A Room of Ones Own a book-length essay. Considered a key work of feminist literary criticism it was written following two lectures she delivered on Women and Fiction at Cambridge University the previous year. In it she examines the historical disempowerment women have faced in many spheres including social educational and financial. One of her more famous dicta is contained within the book A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction. Much of her argument is developed through the unsolved problems of women and fiction writing to arrive at her conclusion although she claimed that was only an opinion upon one minor point. In doing so she states a good deal about the nature of women and fiction employing a quasi-fictional style as she examines where women writers failed because of lack of resources and opportunities examining along the way the experiences of the Brontës George Eliot and George Sand as well as the fictional character of Shakespeares sister equipped with the same genius but not position. She contrasted these women who accepted a deferential status with Jane Austen who wrote entirely as a woman. Michel Lackey argues that a major influence on Woolf from 1912 onward was Russian literature and Woolf adopted many of its aesthetic conventions. The style of Fyodor Dostoyevsky with his depiction of a fluid mind in operation helped to influence Woolfs writings about a discontinuous writing process though Woolf objected to Dostoyevskys obsession with psychological extremity and the tumultuous flux of emotions in his characters together with his right-wing monarchist politics as Dostoyevsky was an ardent supporter of the autocracy of the Russian Empire. In contrast to her objections to Dostoyevskys exaggerated emotional pitch Woolf found much to admire in the work of Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy. Woolf admired Chekhov for his stories of ordinary people living their lives doing banal things and plots that had no neat endings. From Tolstoy Woolf drew lessons about how a novelist should depict a characters psychological state and the interior tension within. Lackey notes that from Ivan Turgenev Woolf drew the lessons that there are multiple Is when writing a novel and the novelist needed to balance those multiple versions of him- or herself to balance the mundane facts of a story vs. the writers overarching vision which required a total passion for art. The American writer Henry David Thoreau also influenced Woolf. In a 1917 essay she praised Thoreau for his statement The millions are awake enough for physical labor but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive. They both aimed to capture the momentas Walter Pater says to burn always with this hard gem-like flame. Woolf praised Thoreau for his simplicity in finding a way for setting free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul. Like Thoreau Woolf believed that it was silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental mystical approach to life and writing where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and the presence of mind to appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age. Woolfs preface to Orlando credits Daniel Defoe Sir Thomas Browne Laurence Sterne Sir Walter Scott Lord Macaulay Emily Brontë Thomas de Quincey and Walter Pater as influences. Among her contemporaries Woolf was influenced by Marcel Proust writing to Roger Fry Oh if I could write like that In her lifetime Woolf was outspoken on many topics that were considered controversial some of which are now considered progressive others regressive. She was an ardent feminist at a time when womens rights were barely recognised and anti-colonialist anti-imperialist and a pacifist when chauvinism was popular. On the other hand she has been criticised for views on class and race in her private writings and published works. Like many of her contemporaries some of her writing is now considered offensive. As a result she is considered polarising a revolutionary feminist and socialist hero or a purveyor of hate speech. Works such as A Room of Ones Own and Three Guineas are frequently taught as icons of feminist literature in courses that would be very critical of some of her views expressed elsewhere. She has also been the recipient of considerable homophobic and misogynist criticism. Virginia Woolf was born into a non-religious family and is regarded along with her fellow Bloomsberries E.M. Forster and G.E. Moore as a humanist. Both her parents were prominent agnostic atheists. Her father Leslie Stephen had become famous in polite society for his writings which expressed and publicised reasons to doubt the veracity of religion. Stephen was also President of the West London Ethical Society an early humanist organisation and helped to found the Union of Ethical Societies in 1896. Woolfs mother Julia Stephen wrote the book Agnostic Women which argued that agnosticism could be a highly moral approach to life. Woolf was a critic of Christianity. In a letter to Ethel Smyth she gave a scathing denunciation of the religion seeing it as self-righteous egotism and stating my Jew has more religion in one toenailmore human love in one hair. Woolf stated in her private letters that she thought of herself as an atheist. She thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheists religion of doing good for the sake of goodness. Hermione Lee cites a number of extracts from Woolfs writings that many including Lee would consider offensive and these criticisms can be traced back as far as those of Wyndham Lewis and Q.D. Leavis in the 1920s and 1930s. Other authors provide more nuanced contextual interpretations and stress the complexity of her character and the apparent inherent contradictions in analysing her apparent flaws. She could certainly be off-hand rude and even cruel in her dealings with other authors translators and biographers such as her treatment of Ruth Gruber. Some authors including David Daiches Brenda Silver Alison Light and other postcolonial feminists dismiss her as privileged elitist classist racist and antisemitic. Woolfs tendentious expressions including prejudicial feelings against disabled people have often been the topic of academic criticism Often accused of antisemitism the treatment of Judaism and Jews by Woolf is far from straightforward. She was happily married to an irreligious Jewish man who had no connection with or knowledge of his people while she generally characterized Jewish characters with negative stereotypes. For instance she described some of the Jewish characters in her work in terms that suggested they were physically repulsive or dirty. On the other hand she could criticise her own views How I hated marrying a Jew how I hated their nasal voices and their oriental jewellery and their noses and their wattles what a snob I was for they have immense vitality and I think I like that quality best of all . These attitudes have been construed to reflect not so much antisemitism but social status; she married outside her social class. Leonard a penniless Jew from Putney lacked the material status of the Stephens and their circle. While travelling on a cruise to Portugal she protested at finding a great many Portuguese Jews on board and other repulsive objects but we keep clear of them. Furthermore she wrote in her diary I do not like the Jewish voice; I do not like the Jewish laugh. Her 1938 short story written during Hitlers reign The Duchess and the Jeweller has been considered antisemitic. Some believe that Woolf and her husband Leonard came to despise and fear the 1930s fascism and antisemitism. Her 1938 book Three Guineas was an indictment of fascism and what Woolf described as a recurring propensity among patriarchal societies to enforce repressive societal mores by violence. And yet her 1938 story The Duchess and the Jeweler was so deep in its hateful depiction of Jews that Harpers Bazaar asked her to modify it before publication. She reluctantly complied. The Bloomsbury Group held very progressive views regarding sexuality and rejected the austere strictness of Victorian society. The majority of its members were homosexual or bisexual. Woolf had several affairs with women the most notable being with Vita Sackville-West. The two women developed a deep connection; Vita was arguably one of the few people in Virginias adult life that she was truly close to. During their relationship both women saw the peak of their literary careers with the titular protagonist of Woolfs acclaimed Orlando A Biography being inspired by Sackville-West. The pair remained lovers for a decade and stayed close friends for the rest of Woolfs life. Woolf had said to Sackville-West she disliked masculinity. Among her other notable affairs were those with Sibyl Colefax Lady Ottoline Morrell and Mary Hutchinson. Some surmise that she may have fallen in love with Madge Symonds the wife of one of her uncles. Madge Symonds was described as one of Woolfs early loves in Sackville-Wests diary. She also fell in love with Violet Dickinson although there is some confusion as to whether the two consummated their relationship. In regards to relationships with men Woolf was averse to sex with them blaming the sexual abuse perpetrated upon her and her sister by her half-brothers when they were children and teens. This is one of the reasons she initially declined marriage proposals from her future husband Leonard. She even went as far as to tell him that she was not attracted to him but that she did love him and finally agreed to marriage. Woolf preferred female lovers to male lovers for the most part based on her aversion to sex with men. This aversion to relations with men influenced her writing especially when considering her sexual abuse as a child. I sometimes think that if I married you I could have everythingand thenis it the sexual side of it that comes between us As I told you brutally the other day I feel no physical attraction in you. - Letter to Leonard from Virginia dated May 1 1912 Leonard became the love of her life and even though their sexual relationship was questionable they loved each other deeply and formed a strong and supportive marriage that led to the formation of their publishing house as well as several of her writings. Neither was faithful to the other sexually but they were faithful in their love and respect for each other. Though at least one biography of Virginia Woolf appeared in her lifetime the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by her nephew Quentin Bell. Hermione Lees 1996 biography Virginia Woolf provides a thorough and authoritative examination of Woolfs life and work which she discussed in an interview in 1997. In 2001 Louise DeSalvo and Mitchell A. Leaska edited The Letters of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf. Julia Briggss Virginia Woolf An Inner Life focuses on Woolfs writing including her novels and her commentary on the creative process to illuminate her life. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu also uses Woolfs literature to understand and analyse gender domination. Woolf biographer Gillian Gill notes that Woolfs traumatic experience of sexual abuse by her half-brothers during her childhood influenced her advocacy of protection of vulnerable children from similar experiences.Biljana Dojčinović has discussed the issues surrounding translations of Woolf to Serbian as a border-crossing. The intense scrutiny of Virginia Woolfs literary output has led to speculation as to her mothers influence including psychoanalytic studies of mother and daughter. Woolf states that my first memory and in fact it is the most important of all my memories is of her mother. Her memories of her mother are memories of an obsession starting with her first major breakdown on her mothers death in 1895 the loss having a profound lifelong effect. In many ways her mothers profound influence on Virginia Woolf is conveyed in the latters recollections there she is; beautiful emphatic ... closer than any of the living are lighting our random lives as with a burning torch infinitely noble and delightful to her children. Woolf described her mother as an invisible presence in her life and Ellen Rosenman argues that the mother-daughter relationship is a constant in Woolfs writing. She describes how Woolfs modernism needs to be viewed in relationship to her ambivalence towards her Victorian mother the centre of the formers female identity and her voyage to her own sense of autonomy. To Woolf Saint Julia was both a martyr whose perfectionism was intimidating and a source of deprivation by her absences real and virtual and premature death. Julias influence and memory pervades Woolfs life and work. She has haunted me she wrote. According to the 2007 book Feminism From Mary Wollstonecraft to Betty Friedan by Bhaskar A. Shukla Recently studies of Virginia Woolf have focused on feminist and lesbian themes in her work such as in the 1997 collection of critical essays Virginia Woolf Lesbian Readings edited by Eileen Barrett and Patricia Cramer. In 1928 Woolf took a grassroots approach to informing and inspiring feminism. She addressed undergraduate women at the ODTAA Society at Girton College Cambridge and the Arts Society at Newnham College with two papers that eventually became A Room of Ones Own . Woolfs best-known nonfiction works A Room of Ones Own and Three Guineas examine the difficulties that female writers and intellectuals faced because men held disproportionate legal and economic power as well as the future of women in education and society. In The Second Sex Simone de Beauvoir counts of all women who ever lived only three female writersEmily Brontë Woolf and sometimes Katherine Mansfield have explored the given. Sally Potter adapted Orlando for the screen in 1992. The film starred Tilda Swinton. Woolfs play Freshwater is the basis for a 1994 chamber opera Freshwater by Andy Vores. The final segment of the 2018 London Unplugged is adapted from her short story Kew Gardens. Septimus and Clarissa a stage adaptation of Mrs. Dalloway was created and produced by the New York-based ensemble Ripe Time in 2011 at the Baruch Performing Arts Center. It was adapted by Ellen McLaughlin and directed and devised by Rachel Dickstein. It was nominated for a 2012 Drama League award for Outstanding Production a Drama Desk nomination for Outstanding Score and a Joe A. Calloway Award nomination for outstanding direction  Virginia Woolf is known for her contributions to 20th-century literature and her essays as well as the influence she has had on literary particularly feminist criticism. A number of authors have stated that their work was influenced by her including Margaret Atwood Michael CunninghamGabriel García Márquez and Toni Morrison. Her iconic image is instantly recognisable from the Beresford portrait of her at twenty to the Beck and Macgregor portrait in her mothers dress in Vogue at 44 or Man Rays cover of Time magazine at 55. More postcards of Woolf are sold by the National Portrait Gallery London than any other person. Her image is ubiquitous and can be found on products ranging from tea towels to T-shirts. Virginia Woolf is studied around the world with organisations such as the Virginia Woolf Society and The Virginia Woolf Society of Japan. In addition trustssuch as the Asham Trustencourage writers in her honour. Although she had no descendants a number of her extended family are notable. In 2013 Woolf was honoured by her alma mater of Kings College London with the opening of the Virginia Woolf Building on Kingsway with a plaque commemorating her time there and her contributions together with this exhibit depicting her accompanied by a quotation London itself perpetually attracts stimulates gives me a play a story a poem from her 1926 diary. Busts of Virginia Woolf have been erected at her home in Rodmell Sussex and at Tavistock Square London where she lived between 1924 and 1939. In 2014 she was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk a walk of fame in San Franciscos Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have made significant contributions in their fields. Woolf Works a womens co-working space in Singapore opened in 2014 and was named after her in tribute to the essay A Room of Ones Own; it also has many other things named after it .A campaign was launched in 2018 by Aurora Metro Arts and Media to erect a statue of Woolf in Richmond where she lived for 10 years. The statue shows her on a bench overlooking the river Thames. In November 2022 the statue created by sculptor Laury Dizengremel was unveiled. It is the first full-size statue of Woolf.
James Joyce,James Augustine Aloysius Joyce was an Irish novelist poet and literary critic. He contributed to the modernist avant-garde movement and is regarded as one of the most influential and important writers of the 20th century. Joyces novel Ulysses is a landmark in which the episodes of Homers Odyssey are paralleled in a variety of literary styles particularly stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection Dubliners and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Finnegans Wake . His other writings include three books of poetry a play letters and occasional journalism. Joyce was born in Dublin into a middle-class family. He attended the Jesuit Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare then briefly the Christian Brothersrun OConnell School. Despite the chaotic family life imposed by his fathers unpredictable finances he excelled at the Jesuit Belvedere College and graduated from University College Dublin in 1902. In 1904 he met his future wife Nora Barnacle and they moved to mainland Europe. He briefly worked in Pula and then moved to Trieste in Austria-Hungary working as an English instructor. Except for an eight-month stay in Rome working as a correspondence clerk and three visits to Dublin Joyce resided there until 1915. In Trieste he published his book of poems Chamber Music and his short story collection Dubliners and he began serially publishing A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in the English magazine The Egoist. During most of World War I Joyce lived in Zürich Switzerland and worked on Ulysses. After the war he briefly returned to Trieste and then moved to Paris in 1920 which became his primary residence until 1940. Ulysses was first published in Paris in 1922 but its publication in the United Kingdom and the United States was prohibited because of its perceived obscenity. Copies were smuggled into both countries and pirated versions were printed until the mid-1930s when publication finally became legal. Joyce started his next major work Finnegans Wake in 1923 publishing it sixteen years later in 1939. Between these years Joyce travelled widely. He and Nora were married in a civil ceremony in London in 1931. He made a number of trips to Switzerland frequently seeking treatment for his increasingly severe eye problems and psychological help for his daughter Lucia. When France was occupied by Germany during World War II Joyce moved back to Zürich in 1940. He died there in 1941 after surgery for a perforated ulcer less than one month before his 59th birthday. Ulysses frequently ranks high in lists of great books of literature and the academic literature analysing his work is extensive and ongoing. Many writers film-makers and other artists have been influenced by his stylistic innovations such as his meticulous attention to detail use of interior monologue wordplay and the radical transformation of traditional plot and character development. Though most of his adult life was spent abroad his fictional universe centres on Dublin and is largely populated by characters who closely resemble family members enemies and friends from his time there. Ulysses in particular is set in the streets and alleyways of the city. Joyce is quoted as saying For myself I always write about Dublin because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal. Joyce was born on 2 February 1882 at 41 Brighton Square Rathgar Dublin Ireland to John Stanislaus Joyce and Mary Jane May . He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings. He was baptised with the name James Augustine Joyce according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church in the nearby St Josephs Church in Terenure on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John OMulloy. His godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann. John Stanislaus Joyces family came from Fermoy in County Cork where they owned a small salt and lime works. Joyces paternal grandfather James Augustine married Ellen OConnell daughter of John OConnell a Cork alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City. Ellens family claimed kinship with the political leader Daniel OConnell who had helped secure Catholic emancipation for the Irish in 1829. Joyces father was appointed rate collector by Dublin Corporation in 1887. The family moved to the fashionable small town of Bray 12 miles from Dublin. Joyce was attacked by a dog around this time leading to his lifelong fear of dogs. He later developed a fear of thunderstorms which he acquired through a superstitious aunt who had described them as a sign of Gods wrath. In 1891 nine-year-old Joyce wrote the poem Et Tu Healy on the death of Charles Stewart Parnell that his father printed and distributed to friends. The poem expressed the sentiments of the elder Joyce who was angry at Parnells apparent betrayal by the Irish Catholic Church the Irish Parliamentary Party and the British Liberal Party that resulted in a collaborative failure to secure Irish Home Rule in the British Parliament. This sense of betrayal particularly by the church left a lasting impression that Joyce expressed in his life and art. That year his family began to slide into poverty worsened by his fathers drinking and financial mismanagement. John Joyces name was published in Stubbs Gazette a blacklist of debtors and bankrupts in November 1891 and he was temporarily suspended from work. In January 1893 he was dismissed with a reduced pension. Joyce began his education in 1888 at Clongowes Wood College a Jesuit boarding school near Clane County Kildare but had to leave in 1891 when his father could no longer pay the fees. He studied at home and briefly attended the Christian Brothers OConnell School on North Richmond Street Dublin. Joyces father then had a chance meeting with the Jesuit priest John Conmee who knew the family. Conmee arranged for Joyce and his brother Stanislaus to attend the Jesuits Dublin school Belvedere College without fees starting in 1893. In 1895 Joyce now aged 13 was elected by his peers to join the Sodality of Our Lady. Joyce spent five years at Belvedere his intellectual formation guided by the principles of Jesuit education laid down in the Ratio Studiorum . He displayed his writing talent by winning first place for English composition in his final two years before graduating in 1898. Joyce enrolled at University College in 1898 to study English French and Italian. While there he was exposed to the scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas which had a strong influence on his thought for the rest of his life. He participated in many of Dublins theatrical and literary circles. His closest colleagues included leading Irish figures of his generation most notably George Clancy Tom Kettle and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. Many of the acquaintances he made at this time appeared in his work. His first publicationa laudatory review of Henrik Ibsens When We Dead Awakenwas printed in The Fortnightly Review in 1900. Inspired by Ibsens works Joyce sent him a fan letter in Norwegian and wrote a play A Brilliant Career which he later destroyed. In 1901 the National Census of Ireland listed Joyce as a 19-year-old Irish- and English-speaking unmarried student living with his parents six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace in Clontarf Dublin. During this year he became friends with Oliver St. John Gogarty the model for Buck Mulligan in Ulysses. In November Joyce wrote an article The Day of the Rabblement criticising the Irish Literary Theatre for its unwillingness to produce the works of playwrights like Ibsen Leo Tolstoy and Gerhart Hauptmann. He protested against nostalgic Irish populism and argued for an outward-looking cosmopolitan literature. Because he mentioned Gabriele DAnnunzios novel which was on the Roman Catholic list of prohibited books his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce and Sheehy-Skeffingtonwho had also had an article rejectedhad their essays jointly printed and distributed. Arthur Griffith decried the censorship of Joyces work in his newspaper United Irishman. Joyce graduated from the Royal University of Ireland in October 1902. He considered studying medicine and began attending lectures at the Catholic University Medical School in Dublin. When the medical school refused to provide a tutoring position to help finance his education he left Dublin to study medicine in Paris where he received permission to attend the course for a certificate in physics chemistry and biology at the École de Médecine. By the end of January 1903 he had given up plans to study medicine but he stayed in Paris often reading late in the . He frequently wrote home claiming ill health due to the water the cold weather and his change of diet appealing for money his family could ill-afford. In April 1903 Joyce learned his mother was dying and immediately returned to Ireland. He would tend to her reading aloud from drafts that would eventually be worked into his unfinished novel Stephen Hero. During her final days she unsuccessfully tried to get him to make his confession and to take communion. She died on 13 August. Afterwards Joyce and Stanislaus refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. John Joyces drinking and abusiveness increased in the months following her death and the family began to fall apart. Joyce spent much of his time carousing with Gogarty and his medical school colleagues and tried to scrape together a living by reviewing books. Joyces life began to change when he met Nora Barnacle on 10 June 1904. She was a twenty-year-old woman from Galway city who was working in Dublin as a chambermaid. They had their first outing together on 16 June 1904 walking through the Dublin suburb of Ringsend where Nora masturbated him. This event was commemorated as the date for the action of Ulysses known in popular culture as Bloomsday in honour of the novels main character Leopold Bloom. This began a relationship that continued for thirty-seven years until Joyce died. Soon after this outing Joyce who had been carousing with his colleagues approached a young woman in St Stephens Green and was beaten up by her companion. He was picked up and dusted off by an acquaintance of his fathers Alfred H. Hunter who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter who was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife became one of the models for Leopold Bloom the protagonist of Ulysses. Joyce was a talented tenor and explored becoming a musical performer. On 8 May 1904 he was a contestant in the Feis Ceoil an Irish music competition for promising composers instrumentalists and singers. In the months before the contest Joyce took singing lessons with two voice instructors Benedetto Palmieri and Vincent OBrien. He paid the entry fee by pawning some of his books. For the contest Joyce had to sing three songs. He did well with the first two but when he was told he had to sight read the third he refused. Joyce won the third-place medal anyway. After the contest Palmieri wrote Joyce that Luigi Denza the composer of the popular song Funiculì Funiculà who was the judge for the contest spoke highly of his voice and would have given him first place but for the sight-reading and lack of sufficient training. Palmieri even offered to give Joyce free singing lessons afterwards. Joyce refused the lessons but kept singing in Dublin concerts that year. His performance at a concert given on 27 August may have solidified Noras devotion to him. Throughout 1904 Joyce sought to develop his literary reputation. On 7 January he attempted to publish a prose work examining aesthetics called A Portrait of the Artist but it was rejected by the intellectual journal Dana. He then reworked it into a fictional novel of his youth that he called Stephen Hero that he labored over for years but eventually abandoned. He wrote a satirical poem called The Holy Office which parodied William Butler Yeatss poem To Ireland in the Coming Times and once more mocked the Irish Literary Revival. It too was rejected for publication; this time for being unholy. He wrote the collection of poems Chamber Music at this time; which was also rejected. He did publish three poems one in Dana and two in The Speaker and George William Russell published three of Joyces short stories in the Irish Homestead. These storiesThe Sisters Eveline and After the Racewere the beginnings of Dubliners. In September 1904 Joyce was having difficulties finding a place to live and moved into a Martello tower near Dublin which Gogarty was renting.Within a week Joyce left when Gogarty and another roommate Dermot Chenevix Trench fired a pistol in the middle of the night at some pans hanging directly over Joyces bed. With the help of funds from Lady Gregory and a few other acquaintances Joyce and Nora left Ireland less than a month later. In October 1904 Joyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile. They briefly stopped in London and Paris to secure funds before heading on to Zürich.Joyce had been informed through an agent in England that there was a vacancy at the Berlitz Language School but when he arrived there was no position. The couple stayed in Zürich for a little over a week. The director of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the First World War. There was no vacancy either. The director of the school in Trieste Almidano Artifoni secured a position for him in Pola then Austria-Hungarys major naval base where he mainly taught English to naval officers. Less than one month after the couple had left Ireland Nora had already become pregnant. Joyce soon became close friends with Alessandro Francini Bruni the director of the school at Pola and his wife Clothilde. By the beginning of 1905 both families were living together. Joyce kept writing when he could. He completed a short story for Dubliners Clay and worked on his novel Stephen Hero. He disliked Pola calling it a back-of-God-speed placea naval Siberia and soon as a job became available he went to Trieste. When 23-year-old Joyce first moved to Trieste in March 1905 he immediately started teaching English at the Berlitz school. By June Joyce felt financially secure enough to have his satirical poem Holy Office printed and asked Stanislaus to distribute copies to his former associates in Dublin.After Nora gave birth to their first child Giorgio on 27 July 1905 Joyce convinced Stanislaus to move to Trieste and got a position for him at the Berlitz school. Stanislaus moved in with Joyce as soon as he arrived in October and most of his salary went directly to supporting Joyces family. In February 1906 the Joyce household once more shared an apartment with the Francini Brunis. Joyce kept writing despite all these changes. He completed 24 chapters of Stephen Hero and all but the final story of Dubliners. But he was unable to get Dubliners in press. Though the London publisher Grant Richards had contracted with Joyce to publish it the printers were unwilling to print passages they found controversial because English law could hold them liable if they were brought to court for indecent language. Richards and Joyce went back and forth trying to find a solution where the book could avoid legal liability while preserving Joyces sense of artistic integrity. As they continued to negotiate Richards began to scrutinise the stories more carefully. He became concerned that the book might damage his publishing houses reputation and eventually backed down from his agreement. Trieste was Joyces main residence until 1920. Although he would temporarily leave the citybriefly staying in Rome travelling to Dublin and emigrating to Zürich during World War I it became a second Dublin for him and played an important role in his development as a writer. He completed Dubliners reworked Stephen Hero into A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man wrote his only published play Exiles and decided to make Ulysses a full-length novel as he created his notes and jottings for the work. He worked out the characters of Leopold and Molly Bloom in Trieste. Many of the novels details were taken from Joyces observation of the city and its people and some of its stylistic innovations appear to have been influenced by Futurism. There are even words of the Triestine dialect in Finnegans Wake. In late May 1906 the head of the Berlitz school ran away after embezzling its funds. Artifoni took over the school but let Joyce know that he could only afford to keep one brother on. Tired of Trieste and discouraged that he could not get a publisher for Dubliners Joyce found an advertisement for a correspondence clerk in a Roman bank that paid twice his current salary. He was hired for the position and went to Rome at the end of July. Joyce felt he accomplished very little during his brief stay in Rome but it had a large impact on his writing. Though his new job took up most of his time he revised the Dubliners and worked on Stephen Hero. Rome was the birthplace of the idea for The Dead which would become the final story of Dubliners and for Ulysses which was originally conceived as a short story. His stay in the city was one of his inspirations for Exiles. While there he read the socialist historian Guglielmo Ferrero in depth. Ferreros anti-heroic interpretations of history arguments against militarism and conflicted attitudes toward Jews would find their way into Ulysses particularly in the character of Leopold Bloom. In London Elkin Mathews published Chamber Music on the recommendation of the British poet Arthur Symons. Nonetheless Joyce was dissatisfied with his job had exhausted his finances and realised he would need additional support when he learned Nora was pregnant again. He left Rome after only seven months. Joyce returned to Trieste in March 1907 but was unable to find full-time work. He went back to being an English instructor working part time for Berlitz and giving private lessons. The author Ettore Schmitz better known by pen name Italo Svevo was one of his students. Svevo was a Catholic of Jewish origin who became one of the models for Leopold Bloom. Joyce learned much of what he knew about Judaism from him. The two became lasting friends and mutual critics. Svevo supported Joyces identity as an author helping him work through his writers block with A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Roberto Prezioso editor of the Italian newspaper Piccolo della Sera was another of Joyces students. He helped Joyce financially by commissioning him to write for the newspaper. Joyce quickly produced three articles aimed toward the Italian irredentists in Trieste. He indirectly paralleled their desire for independence from Austria-Hungary with the struggle of the Irish from British rule. Joyce earned additional money by giving a series of lectures on Ireland and the arts atTriestes Università Popolare. In May Joyce was struck by an attack of rheumatic fever which left him incapacitated for weeks. The illness exacerbated eye problems that plagued him for the rest of his life. While Joyce was still recovering from the attack Lucia was born on 26 July 1907. During his convalescence he was able to finish The Dead the last story of Dubliners. Although a heavy drinker Joyce gave up alcohol for a period in 1908. He reworked Stephen Hero as the more concise and interior A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. He completed the third chapter by April and translated John Millington Synges Riders to the Sea into Italian with the help of Nicolò Vidacovich. He even took singing lessons again. Joyce had been looking for an English publisher for Dubliners but was unable to find one so he submitted it to a Dublin publisher Maunsel and Company owned by George Roberts. In July 1909 Joyce received a years advance payment from one of his students and returned to Ireland to introduce Giorgio to both sides of the family . He unsuccessfully applied for the position of Chair of Italian at his alma mater which had become University College Dublin. He met with Roberts who seemed positive about publishing the Dubliners. He returned to Trieste in September with his sister Eva who helped Nora run the home. Joyce only stayed in Trieste for a month as he almost immediately came upon the idea of starting a cinema in Dublin which unlike Trieste had none. He quickly got the backing of some Triestine business men and returned to Dublin in October launching Irelands first cinema the Volta Cinematograph. It was initially well-received but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister Eileen. From 1910 to 1912 Joyce still lacked a reliable income. This brought his conflicts with Stanislaus who was frustrated with lending him money to their peak. In 1912 Prezioso arranged for him to lecture on Hamlet for the Minerva Society between November 1912 and February 1913. Joyce once more lectured at the Università Popolare on various topics in English literature and applied for a teaching diploma in English at the University of Padua. He performed very well on the qualification tests but was denied because Italy did not recognise his degree from an Irish university. In 1912 Joyce and his family returned to Dublin briefly in the summer. While there his three-year-long struggle with Roberts over the publication of Dubliners came to an end as Roberts refused to publish the book due to concerns of libel. Roberts had the printed sheets destroyed though Joyce was able to obtain a copy of the proof sheets. When Joyce returned to Trieste he wrote an invective against Roberts Gas from a Burner. He never went to Dublin again. Joyces fortunes changed for the better in 1913 when Richards agreed to publish Dubliners. It was issued on 15 June 1914 eight and a half years since Joyce had first submitted it to him. Around the same time he found an unexpected advocate in Ezra Pound who was living in London. On the advice of Yeats Pound wrote to Joyce asking if he could include a poem from Chamber Music I Hear an Army Charging upon the Land in the journal Des Imagistes. They struck up a correspondence that lasted until the late 1930s. Pound became Joyces promoter helping ensure that Joyces works were both published and publicized. After Pound persuaded Dora Marsden to serially publish A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in the London literary magazine The Egoist Joyces pace of writing increased. He completed A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by 1914; resumed Exiles completing it in 1915; started the novelette Giacomo Joyce which he eventually abandoned; and began drafting Ulysses. In August 1914 World War I broke out. Although Joyce and Stanislaus were subjects of the United Kingdom which was now at war with Austria-Hungary they remained in Trieste. Even when Stanislaus who had publicly expressed his sympathy for the Triestine irredentists was interned at the beginning of January 1915 Joyce chose to stay. In May 1915 Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary and less than a month later Joyce took his family to Zürich in neutral Switzerland. Joyce arrived in Zürich as a double exile he was an Irishman with a British passport and a Triestine on parole from Austria-Hungary. To get to Switzerland he had to promise the Austro-Hungarian officials that he would not help the Allies during the war and he and his family had to leave almost all of their possessions in Trieste. During the war he was kept under surveillance by both the British and Austro-Hungarian secret services. Joyces first concern was earning a living. One of Noras relatives sent them a small sum to cover the first few months. Pound and Yeats worked with the British government to provide a stipend from the Royal Literary Fund in 1915 and a grant from the British civil list the following year. Eventually Joyce received large regular sums from the editor Harriet Shaw Weaver who operated The Egoist and the psychotherapist Edith Rockefeller McCormick who lived in Zürich studying under Carl Jung. Weaver financially supported Joyce throughout the entirety of his life and even paid for his funeral. Between 1917 and the beginning of 1919 Joyce was financially secure and lived quite well; the family sometimes stayed in Locarno in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland. However health problems remained a constant issue. During their time in Zürich both Joyce and Nora suffered illnesses that were diagnosed as nervous breakdowns and he had to undergo many eye surgeries. During the war Zürich was the centre of a vibrant expatriate community. Joyces regular evening hangout was the Cafe Pfauen where he got to know a number of the artists living in the city at the time including the sculptor August Suter and the painter Frank Budgen. He often used the time spent with them as material for Ulysses. He made the acquaintance of the writer Stefan Zweig who organised the premiere of Exiles in Munich in August 1919. He became aware of Dada which was coming into its own at the Cabaret Voltaire. He may have even met the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary Vladimir Lenin at the Cafe Odeon a place they both frequented. Joyce kept up his interest in music. He met Ferruccio Busoni staged music with Otto Luening and learned music theory from Philipp Jarnach. Much of what Joyce learned about musical notation and counterpoint found its way into Ulysses particularly the Sirens section. Joyce avoided public discussion of the wars politics and maintained a strict neutrality. He made few comments about the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland; although he was sympathetic to the Irish independence movement he disagreed with its violence. He stayed intently focused on Ulyssesand the ongoing struggle to get his work published. Some of the serial instalments of The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist had been censored by the printers but the entire novel was published by B. W. Huebsch in 1916. In 1918 Pound got a commitment from Margaret Caroline Anderson the owner and editor of the New York-based literary magazine The Little Review to publish Ulysses serially. Joyce co-founded an acting company the English Players and became its business manager. The company was pitched to the British government as a contribution to the war effort and mainly staged works by Irish playwrights such as Oscar Wilde George Bernard Shaw and John Millington Synge. For Synges Riders to the Sea Nora played a principal role and Joyce sang offstage which he did again when Robert Brownings In a Balcony was staged. He hoped the company would eventually stage his play Exiles but his participation in the English Players declined in the wake of the Great Influenza epidemic of 1918 though the company continued until 1920. Joyces work with the English Players involved him in a lawsuit. Henry Wilfred Carr a wounded war veteran and British consul accused Joyce of underpaying him for his role in The Importance of Being Earnest. Carr sued for compensation; Joyce countersued for libel. The cases were resolved in 1919 with Joyce winning the compensation case but losing the one for libel. The incident ended up creating acrimony between the British consulate and Joyce for the rest of his time in Zürich. By 1919 Joyce was in financial straits again. McCormick stopped paying her stipend partly because he refused to submit to psychoanalysis from Jung and Zürich had become expensive to live in after the war. Furthermore he was becoming isolated as the citys emigres returned home. In October 1919 Joyces family moved back to Trieste but it had changed. The Austro-Hungarian empire had ceased to exist and Trieste was now an Italian city in post-war recovery. Eight months after his return Joyce went to Sirmione Italy to meet Pound who made arrangements for him to move to Paris. Joyce and his family packed their belongings and headed for Paris in June 1920. When Joyce and his family arrived in Paris in July 1920 their visit was intended to be a layover on their way to London. For the first four months he stayed with Ludmila Savitzky and met Sylvia Beach who ran the Rive Gauche bookshop Shakespeare and Company. Beach quickly became an important person in Joyces life providing financial support and becoming one of Joyces publishers. Through Beach and Pound Joyce quickly joined the intellectual circle of Paris and was integrated into the international modernist artist community. Joyce met Valery Larbaud who championed Joyces works to the French and supervised the French translation of Ulysses. Paris became the Joyces regular residence for twenty years though they never settled into a single location for long. Joyce finished writing Ulysses near the end of 1921 but had difficulties getting it published. With financial backing from the lawyer John Quinn Margaret Anderson and her co-editor Jane Heap had begun serially publishing it in The Little Review in March 1918 but in January and May 1919 two instalments were suppressed as obscene and potentially subversive. In September 1920 an unsolicited instalment of the Nausicaa episode was sent to the daughter of a New York attorney associated with the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice leading to an official complaint. The trial proceedings continued until February 1921 when both Anderson and Healy defended by Quinn were fined 50 each for publishing obscenity and ordered to cease publishing Ulysses. Huebsch who had expressed interest in publishing the novel in the United States decided against it after the trial.Weaver was unable to find an English printer and the novel was banned for obscenity in the United Kingdom in 1922 where it was blacklisted until 1936. Almost immediately after Anderson and Healy were ordered to stop printing Ulysses Beach agreed to publish it through her bookshop. She had books mailed to people in Paris and the United States who had subscribed to get a copy; Weaver mailed books from Beachs plates to subscribers in England. Soon the postal officials of both countries began confiscating the books. They were then smuggled into both countries. Because the work had no copyright in the United States at this time bootleg versions appeared including pirate versions from publisher Samuel Roth who only ceased his actions in 1928 when a court enjoined publication.Ulysses was not legally published in the United States until 1934 after Judge John M. Woolsey ruled in United States v. One Book Called Ulysses that the book was not obscene. In 1923 Joyce began his next work an experimental novel that eventually became Finnegans Wake. It would take sixteen years to complete. At first Joyce called it Work in Progress which was the name Ford Madox Ford used in April 1924 when he published its Mamalujo episode in his magazine The Transatlantic Review. In 1926 Eugene and Maria Jolas serialised the novel in their magazine transition. When parts of the novel first came out some of Joyces supporterslike Stanislaus Pound and Weaver wrote negatively about it and it was criticised by writers like Seán Ó Faoláin Wyndham Lewis and Rebecca West. In response Joyce and the Jolases organised the publication of a collection of positive essays titled Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress which included writings by Samuel Beckett and William Carlos Williams. An additional purpose of publishing these essays was to market Work in Progress to a larger audience. Joyce publicly revealed the novels title as Finnegans Wake in 1939 the same year he completed it. It was published in London by Faber and Faber with the assistance of T. S. Eliot. Joyces health problems afflicted him throughout his Paris years. He had over a dozen eye operations but his vision severely declined. By 1930 he was practically blind in the left eye and his right eye functioned poorly. He even had all of his teeth removed because of infection. At one point Joyce became worried that he could not finish Finnegans Wake asking the Irish author James Stephens to complete it if something should happen. Joyces financial problems continued. Although he was now earning a good income from his investments and royalties his spending habits often left him without available money. Despite these issues he published Pomes Penyeach in 1927 a collection of thirteen poems that he wrote in Trieste Zürich and Paris. In 1930 Joyce began thinking of establishing a residence in London once more primarily to assure that Giorgio who had just married Helen Fleischmann would have his inheritance secured under British law. Joyce moved to London obtained a long-term lease on a flat registered on the electoral roll and became liable for jury service. After living together for twenty-seven years Joyce and Nora got married at the Register Office in Kensington on 4 July 1931. Joyce stayed in London for at least six months to establish his residency but abandoned his flat and returned to Paris later in the year when Lucia showed signs of mental illness. He planned to return but never did and later became disaffected with England. In later years Joyce lived in Paris but frequently travelled to Switzerland for eye surgery or for treatment for Lucia who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung who had previously written that Ulysses was similar to schizophrenic writing. Jung suggested that she and her father were two people going into a river except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was falling. In spite of Joyces attempts to help Lucia she remained permanently institutionalised after his death. In the late 1930s Joyce became increasingly concerned about the rise of fascism and antisemitism. As early as 1938 Joyce was involved in helping a number of Jews escape Nazi persecution. After the fall of France in 1940 Joyce and his family fled from Nazi occupation returning to Zürich a final time. On 11 January 1941 Joyce underwent surgery in Zürich for a perforated duodenal ulcer. He fell into a coma the following day. He awoke at 2am on 13 January 1941 and asked a nurse to call his wife and son. They were en route when he died 15minutes later less than a month before his 59th birthday. His body was buried in the Fluntern Cemetery in Zürich. Swiss tenor Max Meili sang Addio terra addio cielo from Monteverdis LOrfeo at the burial service. Joyce had been a subject of the United Kingdom all of his life and only the British consul attended the funeral. Although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time neither attended Joyces funeral. When Joseph Walshe secretary at the Department of External Affairs in Dublin was informed of Joyces death by Frank Cremins chargé daffaires at Bern Walshe responded Please wire details of Joyces death. If possible find out did he die a Catholic Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral. Buried originally in an ordinary grave Joyce was moved in 1966 to a more prominent honour grave with a seated portrait statue by American artist Milton Hebald nearby. Nora whom he had married in 1931 survived him by 10 years. She is buried by his side as is their son Giorgio who died in 1976. After Joyces death the Irish government declined Noras request to permit the repatriation of Joyces remains despite being persistently lobbied by the American diplomat John J. Slocum. In October 2019 a motion was put to Dublin City Council to plan and budget for the costs of the exhumations and reburials of Joyce and his family somewhere in Dublin subject to his familys wishes. The proposal immediately became controversial with the Irish Times commenting ... it is hard not to suspect that there is a calculating even mercantile aspect to contemporary Irelands relationship to its great writers whom we are often more keen to celebrate and if possible monetise than read. Throughout his life Joyce stayed actively interested in Irish national politics and in its relationship to British colonialism. He studied socialism and anarchism. He attended socialist meetings and expressed an individualist view influenced by Benjamin Tuckers philosophy and Oscar Wildes essay The Soul of Man Under Socialism. He described his opinions as those of a socialist artist. Joyces direct engagement in politics was strongest during his time in Trieste when he submitted newspaper articles gave lectures and wrote letters advocating for Irelands independence from British rule. After leaving Trieste Joyces direct involvement in politics waned but his later works still reflect his commitment. He remained sympathetic to individualism and critical of coercive ideologies such as nationalism. His novels address socialist anarchist and Irish nationalist issues.Ulysses has been read as a novel critiquing the effect of British colonialism on the Irish people.Finnegans Wake has been read as a work that investigates the divisive issues of Irish politics the interrelationship between colonialism and race and the coercive oppression of nationalism and fascism. Joyces politics is reflected in his attitude toward his British passport. He wrote about the negative effects of British occupation in Ireland and was sympathetic to the attempts of the Irish to free themselves from it. In 1907 he expressed his support for the early Sinn Féin movement before the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. However throughout his life Joyce refused to exchange his British passport for an Irish one. When he had a choice he opted to renew his British passport in 1935 instead of obtaining one from the Irish Free State and he chose to keep it in 1940 when accepting an Irish passport could have helped him to leave Vichy France more easily. His refusal to change his passport was partly due to the advantages that a British passport gave him internationally his being out of sympathy with the violence of Irish politics and his dismay over the Irish Free States political relationship with the Catholic Church. Joyce had a complex relationship with religion. Early in life he lapsed from Roman Catholicism. First-hand statements by himself Stanislaus and Nora attest that he did not consider himself a Catholic. Nevertheless his work is deeply influenced by Catholicism. In particular his intellectual foundations were grounded in his early Jesuitical education. Even after he left Ireland he sometimes went to church. When living in Trieste he woke up early to attend Catholic Mass on Holy Thursday and Good Friday or occasionally attended Eastern Orthodox services stating that he liked the ceremonies better. A number of Catholic critics suggest that Joyce never fully abandoned his faith wrestling with it in his writings and becoming increasingly reconciled with it. They argue that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are expressions of a Catholic sensibility insisting that the critical views of religion expressed by Stephen the protagonist of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses do not represent the views of Joyce the author. Joyces attitude toward Catholicism has been described as an enigma in which there are two Joyces a modern one who resisted Catholic tradition and another who maintained his allegiance to it. It has alternatively been described as a dialectic that is both affirming and denying. For example Stephen Dedaluss statement in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is qualifiedI will not serve that which I no longer believe and that the non-serviam will always be balanced by Stephens I am... servant too and the yes of Molly Blooms final soliloquy in Ulysses. Some critics have suggested that Joyces apparent apostasy was less a denial of faith than a transmutation a criticism of the Churchs adverse impact on spiritual life and personal development. He has been compared to the medieval who left their discipline but not their cultural heritage of thought. Joyces own responses to questions about his faith were often ambiguous. For example during an interview after the completion of Ulysses Joyce was asked When did you leave the Catholic Church He answered Thats for the Church to say. Dubliners is a collection of 15 short stories first published in 1914 that form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle-class life in and around the city in the early 20th century. The tales were written when Irish nationalism and the search for national identity was at its peak. Joyce holds up a mirror to that identity as a first step in the spiritual liberation of Ireland. The stories centre on Joyces idea of an epiphany a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyces novel Ulysses. The initial stories are narrated by child protagonists. Later stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyces tripartite division of the collection into childhood adolescence and maturity. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man published in 1916 is a shortened rewrite of the abandoned novel Stephen Hero. It is a Künstlerroman a kind of coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. It functions both as an autobiographical fiction of the author and a biography of the fictional protagonist. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works such as stream of consciousness interior monologue and references to a characters psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel. Despite early interest in the theatre Joyce published only one play Exiles begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship the play looks back to The Dead and forward to Ulysses which Joyce began around the time of the plays composition. He published three books of poetry. The first full-length collection was Chamber Music which consisted of 36 short lyrics. It led to his inclusion in the Imagist Anthology edited by Ezra Pound a champion of Joyces work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime includes Gas from a Burner Pomes Penyeach and Ecce Puer . These were published by the Black Sun Press in Collected Poems . The action of Ulysses starts on 16 June 1904 at 8am and ends sometime after 2am the following morning. Much of it occurs inside the minds of the characters who are portrayed through techniques such as interior monologue dialogue and soliloquy. The novel consists of 18 episodes each covering roughly one hour of the day using a unique literary style. Joyce structured each chapter to refer to an individual episode in Homers Odyssey as well as a specific colour a particular art or science and a bodily organ.Ulysses sets the characters and incidents of Homers Odyssey in 1904 Dublin representing Odysseus Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus. It uses humor including parody satire and comedy to contrast the novels characters with their Homeric models. Joyce played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles so the work could be read independently of its Homeric structure. Ulysses can be read as a study of Dublin in 1904 exploring various aspects of the citys life dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt using his work as a model. To achieve this sense of detail he relied on his memory what he heard other people remember and his readings to create a sense of fastidious detail. Joyce regularly used the 1904 edition of Thoms Directorya work that listed the owners and tenants of every residential and commercial property in the cityto ensure his descriptions were accurate. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing reliance on a formal schema to structure the narrative and an exquisite attention to detail represents one of the books major contributions to the development of 20th-century modernist literature. Finnegans Wake is an experimental novel that pushes stream of consciousness and literary allusions to their extremes. Although the work can be read from beginning to end Joyces writing transforms traditional ideas of plot and character development through his wordplay allowing the book to be read nonlinearly. Much of the word play stems from the work being written in a peculiar and obscure English based mainly on complex multilevel puns. This approach is similar to but far more extensive than that used by Lewis Carroll in Jabberwocky and draws on a wide range of languages. The associative nature of its language has led to it being interpreted as the story of a dream. The metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola who Joyce had read in his youth plays an important role in Finnegans Wake as it provides the framework for how the identities of the characters interplay and are transformed.Giambattista Vicos cyclical view of history structures the texts narrative as evidenced by the opening and closing words of the book Finnegans Wake opens with the words riverrun past Eve and Adams from swerve of shore to bend of bay brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs and ends A way a lone a last a loved a long the. In other words the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence turning the narrative into one great cycle. Joyces work still has a profound influence on contemporary culture.Ulysses is a model for fiction writers particularly its explorations in the power of language. Its emphasis on the details of everyday life have opened up new possibilities of expression for authors painters and film-makers. It retains its prestige among readers often ranking high on Great Book lists. Joyces innovations extend beyond English literature his writing has been an inspiration for Latin American writers and Finnegans Wake has become one of the key texts for French post-structuralism. It also provided the name for the quark one of the elementary particles proposed by physicist Murray Gell-Mann. The open-ended form of Joyces novels keep them open to constant reinterpretation. They inspire an increasingly global community of literary critics. Joyce studiesbased on a relatively small canon of three novels a small short story collection one play and two small books of poemshave generated over 15000 articles monographs theses translations and editions. In popular culture the work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June known as Bloomsday in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide. The National Library of Ireland holds a large collection of Joycean material including manuscripts and notebooks much of it available online. A joint venture between the library and University College Dublin the Museum of Literature Ireland the majority of whose exhibits are about Joyce and his work has both a small permanent Joyce-related collection and borrows from its parent institutions; its displays include Copy No. 1 of Ulysses. Dedicated centres in Dublin include the James Joyce Centre in North Great Georges Street the James Joyce Tower and Museum in Sandycove and the Dublin Writers Museum.University College London holds the only major research collection of Joyces work in the United Kingdom including first editions of all of Joyces major works most other early and later editions as well as critical and background literature.
D. H. Lawrence,David Herbert Lawrence was an English novelist short story writer poet and essayist. His modernist works reflect on modernity social alienation and industrialization while championing sexuality vitality and instinct. Several of his novels Sons and Lovers The Rainbow Women in Love and Lady Chatterleys Lover were the subject of censorship trials for their radical portrayals of sexuality and use of explicit language. Lawrences opinions and artistic preferences earned him a controversial reputation; he endured contemporary persecution and public misrepresentation of his creative work throughout his life much of which he spent in a voluntary exile that he described as a savage enough pilgrimage. At the time of his death he had been variously scorned as tasteless avant-garde and a pornographer who had only garnered success for erotica; however English novelist and critic E. M. Forster in an obituary notice challenged this widely held view describing him as the greatest imaginative novelist of our generation. Later English literary critic F. R. Leavis also championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness. The fourth child of Arthur John Lawrence a barely literate miner at Brinsley Colliery and Lydia Beardsall a former pupil-teacher who had been forced to perform manual work in a lace factory due to her familys financial difficulties Lawrence spent his formative years in the coal mining town of Eastwood Nottinghamshire. The house in which he was born 8a Victoria Street is now the D. H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum. His working-class background and the tensions between his parents provided the raw material for a number of his early works. Lawrence roamed out from an early age in the patches of open hilly country and remaining fragments of Sherwood Forest in Felley woods to the north of Eastwood beginning a lifelong appreciation of the natural world and he often wrote about the country of my heart as a setting for much of his fiction. The young Lawrence attended Beauvale Board School from 1891 until 1898 becoming the first local pupil to win a county council scholarship to Nottingham High School in nearby Nottingham. He left in 1901 working for three months as a junior clerk at Haywoods surgical appliances factory but a severe bout of pneumonia ended this career. During his convalescence he often visited Haggs Farm the home of the Chambers family and began a friendship with Jessie Chambers one of the daughters who would go on to inspire characters in his writing. An important aspect of this relationship with Chambers and other adolescent acquaintances was a shared love of books an interest that lasted throughout Lawrences life.  In the years 1902 to 1906 Lawrence served as a pupil-teacher at the British School Eastwood. He went on to become a full-time student and received a teaching certificate from University College Nottingham in 1908. During these early years he was working on his first poems some short stories and a draft of a novel Laetitia which was eventually to become The White Peacock. At the end of 1907 he won a short story competition in the Nottinghamshire Guardian the first time that he had gained any wider recognition for his literary talents. In the autumn of 1908 the newly qualified Lawrence left his childhood home for London. While teaching in Davidson Road School Croydon he continued writing. Jessie Chambers submitted some of Lawrences early poetry to Ford Madox Ford editor of the influential The English Review. Hueffer then commissioned the story Odour of Chrysanthemums which when published in that magazine encouraged Heinemann a London publisher to ask Lawrence for more work. His career as a professional author now began in earnest although he taught for another year.  Shortly after the final proofs of his first published novel The White Peacock appeared in 1910 Lawrences mother died of cancer. The young man was devastated and he was to describe the next few months as his sick year. Due to Lawrences close relationship with his mother his grief became a major turning point in his life just as the death of his character Mrs. Morel is a major turning point in his autobiographical novel Sons and Lovers a work that draws upon much of the writers provincial upbringing. Essentially concerned with the emotional battle for Lawrences love between his mother and Miriam the novel also documents Lawrences brief intimate relationship with Chambers that Lawrence had finally initiated in the Christmas of 1909 ending it in August 1910. The hurt this caused Chambers and finally her portrayal in the novel ended their friendship; after it was published they never spoke again. In 1911 Lawrence was introduced to Edward Garnett a publishers reader who acted as a mentor and became a valued friend as did his son David. Throughout these months the young author revised Paul Morel the first draft of what became Sons and Lovers. In addition a teaching colleague Helen Corke gave him access to her intimate diaries about an unhappy love affair which formed the basis of The Trespasser his second novel. In November 1911 Lawrence came down with a pneumonia again; once recovered he abandoned teaching in order to become a full-time writer. In February 1912 he broke off an engagement to Louie Burrows an old friend from his days in Nottingham and Eastwood. In March 1912 Lawrence met Frieda Weekley with whom he was to share the rest of his life. Six years his senior she was married to Ernest Weekley his former modern languages professor at University College Nottingham and had three young children. However she and Lawrence eloped and left England for Friedas parents home in Metz a garrison town near the disputed border with France. Lawrence experienced his first encounter with tensions between Germany and France when he was arrested and accused of being a British spy before being released following an intervention from Friedas father. After this incident Lawrence left for a small hamlet to the south of Munich where he was joined by Frieda for their honeymoon later memorialised in the series of love poems titled Look We Have Come Through . During 1912 Lawrence wrote the first of his so-called mining plays The Daughter-in-Law written in Nottingham dialect. The play was never to be performed or even published in Lawrences lifetime. From Germany they walked southwards across the Alps to Italy a journey that was recorded in the first of his travel books a collection of linked essays titled Twilight in Italy and the unfinished novel Mr Noon. During his stay in Italy Lawrence completed the final version of Sons and Lovers. Having become tired of the manuscript he allowed Edward Garnett to cut roughly 100 pages from the text. The novel was published in 1913 and hailed as a vivid portrait of the realities of working class provincial life. Lawrence and Frieda returned to Britain in 1913 for a short visit during which they encountered and befriended critic John Middleton Murry and New Zealand-born short story writer Katherine Mansfield.  Also during that year on 28 July Lawrence met Welsh tramp poet W. H. Davies whose nature poetry he greatly admired. Davies collected autographs and had been particularly keen to obtain Lawrences signature. Georgian poetry publisher Edward Marsh secured an autograph probably as part of a signed poem for Davies and hosted a meeting in London at which the poet met with Lawrence and his wife. Lawrence was immediately captivated by Davies and later invited him to visit them in Germany. However despite this early enthusiasm for Davies work Lawrences opinion changed after reading Foliage; whilst in Italy he also disparaged Nature Poems calling them so thin one can hardly feel them. After the couple returned to Italy staying in a cottage in Fiascherino on the Gulf of Spezia Lawrence wrote the first draft of what would later be transformed into two of his best-known novels The Rainbow and Women in Love in which unconventional female characters take centre stage. Both novels were highly controversial and were banned on publication in the UK for obscenity although Women in Love was banned only temporarily.  The Rainbow follows three generations of a Nottinghamshire farming family from the pre-industrial to the industrial age focusing particularly on a daughter Ursula and her aspiration for a more fulfilling life than that of becoming a housebound wife.Women in Love delves into the complex relationships between four major characters including the sisters Ursula and Gudrun. Both novels explored grand themes and ideas that challenged conventional thought on the arts politics economic growth gender sexual experience friendship and marriage. Lawrences views as expressed in the novels are now thought to be far ahead of his time. The frank and relatively straightforward manner in which he wrote about sexual attraction was ostensibly why the books were initially banned in particular the mention of same-sex attraction; Ursula has an affair with a woman in The Rainbow and there is an undercurrent of attraction between the two principal male characters in Women in Love. While working on Women in Love in Cornwall during 191617 Lawrence developed a strong relationship with a Cornish farmer named William Henry Hocking which some scholars believe was possibly romantic especially considering Lawrences fascination with the theme of homosexuality in Women in Love. Although Lawrence never made it clear their relationship was sexual Frieda believed it was. In a letter written during 1913 he writes I should like to know why nearly every man that approaches greatness tends to homosexuality whether he admits it or not.... He is also quoted as saying I believe the nearest Ive come to perfect love was with a young coal-miner when I was about 16. However given his enduring and robust relationship with Frieda it is likely that he was primarily bi-curious and whether he actually ever had homosexual relations remains an open question. Eventually Frieda obtained her divorce from Ernest Weekley. Lawrence and Frieda returned to Britain shortly before the outbreak of World War I and were legally married on 13 July 1914. During this time Lawrence worked with London intellectuals and writers such as Dora Marsden T. S. Eliot Ezra Pound and others connected with The Egoist an important Modernist literary magazine that published some of his work. Lawrence also worked on adapting Filippo Tommaso Marinettis Manifesto of Futurism into English. He also met the young Jewish artist Mark Gertler with whom he became good friends for a time; Lawrence would later express his admiration for Gertlers 1916 anti-war painting Merry-Go-Round as the best modern picture I have seen. . . it is great and true. Gertler would inspire the character Loerke in Women in Love.  Friedas German parentage and Lawrences open contempt for militarism caused them to be viewed with suspicion and live in near-destitution during wartime Britain; this may have contributed to The Rainbow being suppressed and investigated for its alleged obscenity in 1915. Later the couple were accused of spying and signaling to German submarines off the coast of Cornwall where they lived at Zennor. During this period Lawrence finished his final draft of Women in Love. Not published until 1920 it is now widely recognized as a novel of great dramatic force and intellectual subtlety. In late 1917 after constant harassment by the armed forces and other authorities Lawrence was forced to leave Cornwall at three days notice under the terms of the Defence of the Realm Act. This persecution was later described in an autobiographical chapter of his novel Kangaroo . Lawrence spent a few months of early 1918 in the small rural village of Hermitage near Newbury Berkshire. Subsequently he lived for just under a year at Mountain Cottage Middleton-by-Wirksworth Derbyshire where he wrote one of his most poetic short stories Wintry Peacock. Until 1919 poverty compelled him to shift from address to address. During this period he barely survived a severe attack of influenza. After the wartime years Lawrence began what he termed his savage pilgrimage a time of voluntary exile from his native country. He escaped from Britain at the earliest practical opportunity and returned only twice for brief visits spending the remainder of his life travelling with Frieda. This wanderlust took him to Australia Italy Ceylon the United States Mexico and the South of France. Abandoning Britain in November 1919 they headed south first to the Abruzzo region in central Italy and then onwards to Capri and the Fontana Vecchia in Taormina Sicily. From Sicily they made brief excursions to Sardinia Monte Cassino Malta Northern Italy Austria and Southern Germany.  Many of these places appear in Lawrences writings including The Lost Girl Aarons Rod and the fragment titled Mr Noon . He wrote novellas such as The Captains Doll The Fox and The Ladybird. In addition some of his short stories were issued in the collection England My England and Other Stories. During these years Lawrence also wrote poems about the natural world in Birds Beasts and Flowers.  Lawrence is often considered one of the finest travel writers in English. Sea and Sardinia describes a brief journey undertaken in January 1921 and focuses on the life of Sardinias people. Less well known is his eighty-four page introduction to Maurice Magnuss 1924 Memoirs of the Foreign Legion in which Lawrence recalls his visit to the monastery of Monte Cassino. His other nonfiction books include two responses to Freudian psychoanalysis Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious and Fantasia of the Unconscious; Movements in European History a school textbook published under a pseudonym is a reflection of Lawrences blighted reputation in Britain. In late February 1922 the Lawrences left Europe intending to migrate to the United States. They sailed in an easterly direction however first to Ceylon and then on to Australia. During a short residence in Darlington Western Australia Lawrence met local writer Mollie Skinner with whom he coauthored the novel The Boy in the Bush. This stay was followed by a brief stop in the small coastal town of Thirroul New South Wales during which Lawrence completed Kangaroo a novel about local fringe politics that also explored his wartime experiences in Cornwall. It was with this in mind that they made for Taos New Mexico a Pueblo town where many white bohemians had settled including Mabel Dodge Luhan a prominent socialite. Here they eventually acquired the 160-acre Kiowa Ranch now called the D. H. Lawrence Ranch in 1924 from Dodge Luhan in exchange for the manuscript of Sons and Lovers. The couple stayed in New Mexico for two years with extended visits to Lake Chapala and Oaxaca in Mexico. While Lawrence was in New Mexico he was visited by Aldous Huxley. Editor and book designer Merle Armitage wrote a book about D. H. Lawrence in New Mexico. Taos Quartet in Three Movements was originally to appear in Flair Magazine but the magazine folded before its publication. This short work describes the tumultuous relationship of D. H. Lawrence his wife Frieda artist Dorothy Brett and Mabel Dodge Sterne Luhan. Armitage took it upon himself to print 16 hardcover copies of this work for his friends. Richard Pousette-Dart executed the drawings for Taos Quartet published in 1950. While in the US Lawrence rewrote and published Studies in Classic American Literature a set of critical essays begun in 1917 and described by Edmund Wilson as one of the few first-rate books that have ever been written on the subject. These interpretations with their insights into symbolism New England Transcendentalism and the Puritan sensibility were a significant factor in the revival of the reputation of Herman Melville during the early 1920s. In addition Lawrence completed new fictional works including The Boy in the Bush The Plumed Serpent St Mawr The Woman who Rode Away The Princess and other short stories. He also produced the collection of linked travel essays that became Mornings in Mexico. A brief voyage to England at the end of 1923 was a failure and Lawrence soon returned to Taos convinced his life as an author now lay in the United States. However in March 1925 he suffered a near fatal attack of malaria and tuberculosis while on a third visit to Mexico. Although he eventually recovered the diagnosis of his condition obliged him to return once again to Europe. He was dangerously ill and poor health limited his ability to travel for the remainder of his life. The Lawrences made their home in a villa in Northern Italy near Florence where he wrote The Virgin and the Gipsy and the various versions of Lady Chatterleys Lover . The latter book his last major novel was initially published in private editions in Florence and Paris and reinforced his notoriety. A story set once more in Nottinghamshire about a cross-class relationship between a Lady and her gamekeeper it broke new ground in describing their sexual relationship in explicit yet literary language. Lawrence hoped to challenge the British taboos around sex to enable men and women to think sex fully completely honestly and cleanly. Lawrence responded robustly to those who took offense even publishing satirical poems as well as a tract on Pornography and Obscenity. The return to Italy allowed him to renew old friendships; during these years he was particularly close to Aldous Huxley who was to edit the first collection of Lawrences letters after his death along with a memoir. After Lawrence visited local archaeological sites with artist Earl Brewster in April 1927 his collected essays inspired by the excursions were published as Sketches of Etruscan Places a book that contrasts the lively past with Benito Mussolinis fascism.Lawrence continued to produce short stories and other works of fiction such as The Escaped Cock an unorthodox reworking of the story of Jesus Christs Resurrection.  During his final years Lawrence renewed his serious interest in oil painting. Official harassment persisted and an exhibition of his paintings at the Warren Gallery in London was raided by the police in mid 1929 and several works were confiscated. Lawrence continued to write despite his failing health. In his last months he wrote numerous poems reviews and essays as well as a robust defence of his last novel against those who sought to suppress it. His last significant work was a reflection on the Book of Revelation Apocalypse. After being discharged from a sanatorium he died on 2 March 1930 at the Villa Robermond in Vence France from complications of tuberculosis. Frieda commissioned an elaborate headstone for his grave bearing a mosaic of his adopted emblem of the phoenix. After Lawrences death Frieda lived with the couples friend Angelo Ravagli on their Taos ranch and eventually married him in 1950. In 1935 Ravagli arranged on Friedas behalf to have Lawrences body exhumed and cremated. However upon boarding the ship he learned he would have to pay taxes on the ashes so he instead spread them in the Mediterranean a more preferable resting place in his opinion than a concrete block in a chapel. The ashes brought back were dust and earth and remain interred on the Taos ranch in a small chapel amid the mountains of New Mexico. Lawrence is best known for his novels Sons and Lovers The Rainbow Women in Love and Lady Chatterleys Lover. In these books Lawrence explores the possibilities for life within an industrial setting. In particular Lawrence is concerned with the nature of relationships that can be had within such a setting. Though often classed as a realist Lawrence in fact uses his characters to give form to his personal philosophy. His depiction of sexuality seen as shocking when his work was first published in the early 20th century has its roots in this highly personal way of thinking and being. In his later years Lawrence developed the potentialities of the short novel form in St Mawr The Virgin and the Gypsy and The Escaped Cock. Lawrences best-known short stories include The Captains Doll The Fox The Ladybird Odour of Chrysanthemums The Princess The Rocking-Horse Winner St Mawr The Virgin and the Gypsy and The Woman who Rode Away. Among his most praised collections is The Prussian Officer and Other Stories published in 1914. His collection The Woman Who Rode Away and Other Stories published in 1928 develops the theme of leadership that Lawrence also explored in novels such as Kangaroo and The Plumed Serpent and the story Fanny and Annie. Lawrence wrote almost 800 poems most of them relatively short. His first poems were written in 1904 and two of his poems Dreams Old and Dreams Nascent were among his earliest published works in The English Review. It has been claimed that his early works clearly place him in the school of Georgian poets and indeed some of his poems appear in the Georgian Poetry anthologies. However James Reeves in his book on Georgian Poetry notes that Lawrence was never really a Georgian poet. Indeed later critics contrast Lawrences energy and dynamism with the complacency of Georgian poetry. Just as the First World War dramatically changed the work of many of the poets who saw service in the trenches Lawrences own work dramatically changed during his years in Cornwall. During this time he wrote free verse influenced by Walt Whitman. He set forth his manifesto for much of his later verse in the introduction to New Poems. We can get rid of the stereotyped movements and the old hackneyed associations of sound or sense. We can break down those artificial conduits and canals through which we do so love to force our utterance. We can break the stiff neck of habit But we cannot positively prescribe any motion any rhythm. In the deep strange-scented shade of the great dark carob treeI came down the steps with my pitcherAnd must wait must stand and wait for there he was at the trough before me. Look We have come through is his other work from the period of the end of the war and it reveals another important element common to much of his writings; his inclination to lay himself bare in his writings. Ezra Pound in his Literary Essays complained of Lawrences interest in his own disagreeable sensations but praised him for his low-life narrative. This is a reference to Lawrences dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of Robert Burns in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of Nottinghamshire from his youth. Tha thought tha wanted ter be rid o me.Appen tha did an a.Tha thought tha wanted ter marry an seIf ter couldna be master an th womans bossThad need a woman different from meAn tha knowed it; ay yet tha comes acrossTer say goodbye an a. Although Lawrences works after his Georgian period are clearly in the modernist tradition they were often very different from those of many other modernist writers such as Pound. Pounds poems were often austere with every word carefully worked on. Lawrence felt all poems had to be personal sentiments and that a sense of spontaneity was vital. He called one collection of poems Pansies partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse but also as a pun on the French word panser to dress or bandage a wound. Pansies as he made explicit in the introduction to New Poems is also a pun on Blaise Pascals Pensées. The Noble Englishman and Dont Look at Me were removed from the official edition of Pansies on the grounds of obscenity which wounded him. Even though he lived most of the last ten years of his life abroad his thoughts were often still on England. Published in 1930 just eleven days after his death his last work Nettles was a series of bitter nettling but often wry attacks on the moral climate of England. O the stale old dogs who pretend to guardthe morals of the masseshow smelly they make the great back-yardwetting after everyone that passes. Two notebooks of Lawrences unprinted verse were posthumously published as Last Poems and More Pansies. These contain two of Lawrences most famous poems about death Bavarian Gentians and The Ship of Death. Lawrences criticism of other authors often provides insight into his own thinking and writing. Of particular note is his Study of Thomas Hardy and Other Essays. In Studies in Classic American Literature Lawrences responses to writers like Walt Whitman Herman Melville and Edgar Allan Poe also shed light on his craft. Lawrence wrote A Colliers Friday Night about 19061909 though it was not published until 1939 and not performed until 1965. He wrote The Daughter-in-Law in 1913 though it was not staged until 1967 when it was well received. In 1911 he wrote The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd which he revised in 1914; it was staged in the US in 1916 and in the UK in 1920 in an amateur production. It was filmed in 1976; an adaptation was shown on television in 1995. He also wrote Touch and Go towards the end of World War I and his last play David in 1925. D. H. Lawrence had a lifelong interest in painting which became one of his main forms of expression in his last years. His paintings were exhibited at the Warren Gallery in Londons Mayfair in 1929. The exhibition was extremely controversial with many of the 13000 people visiting mainly to gawk. The Daily Express claimed Fight with an Amazon represents a hideous bearded man holding a fair-haired woman in his lascivious grip while wolves with dripping jaws look on expectantly is frankly indecent. However several artists and art experts praised the paintings. Gwen John reviewing the exhibition in Everyman spoke of Lawrences stupendous gift of self-expression and singled out The Finding of Moses Red Willow Trees and Boccaccio Story as pictures of real beauty and great vitality. Others singled out Contadini for special praise. After a complaint the police seized thirteen of the twenty-five paintings . Despite declarations of support from many writers artists and Members of Parliament Lawrence was able to recover his paintings only by agreeing never to exhibit them in England again. The largest collection of the paintings is now at La Fonda de Taos hotel in Taos New Mexico. Several others including Boccaccio Story and Resurrection are at the Humanities Research Centre of the University of Texas at Austin. A heavily censored abridgement of Lady Chatterleys Lover was published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf in 1928. This edition was posthumously reissued in paperback in the United States by both Signet Books and Penguin Books in 1946. The first unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterleys Lover was printed in July 1928 in Florence by a small publisher Giuseppe Orioli 1000 copies in a very good print according D. H. Lawrence who wrote a thank-you poem to Orioli. When the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterleys Lover was published by Penguin Books in Britain in 1960 the trial of Penguin under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959 became a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The 1959 act had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. One of the objections was to the frequent use of the word fuck and its derivatives and the word cunt. Various academic critics and experts of diverse kinds including E. M. Forster Helen Gardner Richard Hoggart Raymond Williams and Norman St John-Stevas were called as witnesses and the verdict delivered on 2 November 1960 was not guilty. This resulted in a far greater degree of freedom for publishing explicit material in the UK. The prosecution was ridiculed for being out of touch with changing social norms when the chief prosecutor Mervyn Griffith-Jones asked if it were the kind of book you would wish your wife or servants to read. The Penguin second edition published in 1961 contains a publishers dedication which reads For having published this book Penguin Books were prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 at the Old Bailey in London from 20 October to 2 November 1960. This edition is therefore dedicated to the twelve jurors three women and nine men who returned a verdict of Not Guilty and thus made D. H. Lawrences last novel available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom. Despite often writing about political spiritual and philosophical matters Lawrence was essentially contrary by nature and hated to be pigeonholed. Critics such as Terry Eagleton have argued that Lawrence was right wing due to his lukewarm attitude to democracy which he intimated would tend towards the leveling down of society and the subordination of the individual to the sensibilities of the average man. In his letters to Bertrand Russell around 1915 Lawrence voiced his opposition to enfranchising the working class and his hostility to the burgeoning labour movements and disparaged the French Revolution referring to Liberty Equality and Fraternity as the three-fanged serpent. Rather than a republic Lawrence called for an absolute dictator and equivalent dictatrix to lord over the lower peoples. In 1953 recalling his relationship with Lawrence in the First World War Russell characterised Lawrence as a proto-German Fascist saying I was a firm believer in democracy whereas he had developed the whole philosophy of Fascism before the politicians had thought of it. Russell felt Lawrence to be a positive force for evil. However in 1924 Lawrence wrote an epilogue to Movements in European History in which he denounced fascism and Soviet-style socialism as bullying and a mere worship of Force. Further he declared I believe a good form of socialism if it could be brought about would be the best form of government. In the late 1920s he told his sister he would vote Labour if he was living back in England. In general though Lawrence disliked any organized groupings and in his essay Democracy written in the late twenties he argued for a new kind of democracy in which Lawrence held seemingly contradictory views on feminism. The evidence of his written works particularly his earlier novels indicates a commitment to representing women as strong independent and complex; he produced major works in which young self-directing female characters were central. In his youth he supported extending the vote to women and he once wrote All women in their natures are like giantesses. They will break through everything and go on with their own lives. However some feminist critics notably Kate Millett have criticised indeed ridiculed Lawrences sexual politics Millett claiming that he uses his female characters as mouthpieces to promote his creed of male supremacy and that his story The Woman Who Rode Away showed Lawrence as a pornographic sadist with its portrayal of human sacrifice performed upon the woman to the greater glory and potency of the male.Brenda Maddox further highlights this story and two others written around the same time St. Mawr and The Princess as masterworks of misogyny. Despite the inconsistency and at times inscrutability of his philosophical writings Lawrence continues to find an audience and the publication of a new scholarly edition of his letters and writings has demonstrated the range of his achievement. Philosophers like Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari found in Lawrences critique of Sigmund Freud an important precursor of anti-Oedipal accounts of the unconscious that has been much influential. In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death he did nothing that he did not really want to do and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world he owned a ranch he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things and sang and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other mans while the best are admitted even by those who hate him to be unsurpassed. Without vices with most human virtues the husband of one wife scrupulously honest this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilisation and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owlseach one secretly chained by the legwho now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing but he did it and long after they are forgotten sensitive and innocent peopleif any are leftwill turn Lawrences pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was. Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However the most influential advocate of Lawrences literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow Women in Love and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterleys Lover in America in 1959 and in Britain in 1960 and subsequent publication of the full text ensured Lawrences popularity with a wider public. Since 2008 an annual D. H. Lawrence Festival has been organised in Eastwood to celebrate Lawrences life and works; in September 2016 events were held in Cornwall to celebrate the centenary of Lawrences connection with Zennor. John Worthen D. H. Lawrence The Early Years 18851912 
A. A. Milne,Alan Alexander Milne was an English writer best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh as well as for childrens poetry. Milne was primarily a playwright before the huge success of Winnie-the-Pooh overshadowed all his previous work. Milne served in both World Wars as a lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in the First World War and as a captain in the Home Guard in the Second World War. Milne was the father of bookseller Christopher Robin Milne upon whom the character Christopher Robin is based. It was during a visit to London Zoo where Christopher became enamoured with the tame and amiable bear Winnipeg that Milne was inspired to write the story of Winnie-the-Pooh for his son. Milne bequeathed the original manuscripts of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories to the Wren Library at Trinity College Cambridge his alma mater. Alan Alexander Milne was born in Kilburn London to John Vine Milne who was born in Jamaica and Sarah Marie Milne on 18 January 1882. He grew up at Henley House School 67 Mortimer Road Kilburn a small independent school run by his father. One of his teachers was H. G. Wells who taught there in 188990. Milne attended Westminster School and Trinity College Cambridge where he studied on a mathematics scholarship graduating with a B.A. in Mathematics in 1903. He edited and wrote for Granta a student magazine. He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milnes work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor. Considered a talented cricket fielder Milne played for two amateur teams that were largely composed of British writers the Allahakbarries and the Authors XI. His teammates included fellow writers J. M. Barrie Arthur Conan Doyle and P. G. Wodehouse. Milne joined the British Army in World War I and served as an officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was commissioned into the 4th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment on 1 February 1915 as a second lieutenant . His commission was confirmed on 20 December 1915. He served on the Somme as a signals officer from July-November 1916 but caught trench fever and was invalided back to England. Having recuperated he worked as a signals instructor before being recruited into Military Intelligence to write propaganda articles for MI7 between 1917 and 1918. He was discharged on 14 February 1919 and settled in Mallord Street Chelsea. He relinquished his commission on 19 February 1920 retaining the rank of lieutenant. After the war he wrote a denunciation of war titled Peace with Honour which he retracted somewhat with 1940s War with Honour. During World War II Milne was one of the most prominent critics of fellow English writer P. G. Wodehouse who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his countrys enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories and claiming that Milne was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff. Milne married Dorothy Daphne de Sélincourt in 1913 and their son Christopher Robin Milne was born in 1920. In 1925 Milne bought a country home Cotchford Farm in Hartfield East Sussex. During World War II Milne was a captain in the British Home Guard in Hartfield Forest Row insisting on being plain Mr. Milne to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid and by August 1953 he seemed very old and disenchanted. Milne died in January 1956 aged 74. After graduating from Cambridge University in 1903 A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to Punch joining the staff in 1906 and becoming an assistant editor. During this period he published 18 plays and three novels including the murder mystery The Red House Mystery . His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of childrens poems When We Were Very Young which were illustrated by Punch staff cartoonist E. H. Shepard. A collection of short stories for children A Gallery of Children and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books were first published in 1925. Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films . These were The Bump starring Aubrey Smith; Twice Two; Five Pound Reward; and Bookworms. Some of these films survive in the archives of the British Film Institute. Milne had met Howard when the actor starred in Milnes play Mr Pim Passes By in London. Looking back on this period Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story he was told that what the country wanted from a Punch humorist was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for childrens books. He concluded that the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others. Milne is most famous for his two Pooh books about a boy named Christopher Robin after his son Christopher Robin Milne and various characters inspired by his sons stuffed animals most notably the bear named Winnie-the-Pooh. Christopher Robin Milnes stuffed bear originally named Edward was renamed Winnie after a Canadian black bear named Winnie which was used as a military mascot in World War I and left to London Zoo during the war. The Pooh comes from a swan the young Milne named Pooh. E. H. Shepard illustrated the original Pooh books using his own sons teddy Growler as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin Milnes toys Piglet Eeyore Kanga Roo and Tigger were incorporated into A. A. Milnes stories and two more characters Rabbit and Owl were created by Milnes imagination. Christopher Robin Milnes own toys are now on display in New York where 750000 people visit them every year.The fictional Hundred Acre Wood of the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex South East England where the Pooh stories were set. Milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at Cotchford Farm .mw-parser-output .geo-default.mw-parser-output .geo-dms.mw-parser-output .geo-decdisplayinline.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct.mw-parser-output .geo-inline-hiddendisplaynone.mw-parser-output .longitude.mw-parser-output .latitudewhite-spacenowrap510524N 00625E 51.090N 0.107E51.090; 0.107 and took his son walking there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented Poohs Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical. Popular tourist locations at Ashdown Forest include Galleons Lap The Enchanted Place the Heffalump Trap and Lone Pine Eeyores Sad and Gloomy Place and the wooden Pooh Bridge where Pooh and Piglet invented Poohsticks. Not yet known as Pooh he made his first appearance in a poem Teddy Bear published in Punch magazine in February 1924 and republished that year in When We Were Very Young. Pooh first appeared in the London Evening News on Christmas Eve 1925 in a story called The Wrong Sort of Bees.Winnie-the-Pooh was published in 1926 followed by The House at Pooh Corner in 1928. A second collection of nursery rhymes Now We Are Six was published in 1927. All four books were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. Milne also published four plays in this period. He also gallantly stepped forward to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouses A Damsel in Distress.The World of Pooh won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. The success of his childrens books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had until then found a ready audience for each change of direction he had freed pre-war Punch from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in The Red House Mystery . But once Milne had in his own words said goodbye to all that in 70000 words he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality given that one of the sources of inspiration his son was growing older. Another reason Milne stopped writing childrens books and especially about Winnie-the-Pooh was that he felt amazement and disgust over the immense fame his son was exposed to and said that I feel that the legal Christopher Robin has already had more publicity than I want for him. I do not want CR Milne to ever wish that his name were Charles Robert. In his literary home Punch where the When We Were Very Young verses had first appeared Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote including the long poem The Norman Church and an assembly of articles entitled Year In Year Out . In 1930 Milne adapted Kenneth Grahames novel The Wind in the Willows for the stage as Toad of Toad Hall. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn could not survive translation to the theatre. A special introduction written by Milne is included in some editions of Grahames novel. Milne and his wife became estranged from their son who came to resent what he saw as his fathers exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye. Christophers marriage to his first cousin Lesley de Sélincourt distanced him still further from his parents Lesleys father and Christophers mother had not spoken to each other for 30 years. A. A. Milne died at his home in Hartfield Sussex on 31 January 1956 nearly two weeks after his 74th birthday. A memorial service took place on 10 February at All Hallows-by-the-Tower church in London. The rights to A. A. Milnes Pooh books were left to four beneficiaries his family the Royal Literary Fund Westminster School and the Garrick Club. After Milnes death in 1956 thirteen days after his 74th birthday his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to Stephen Slesinger whose widow sold the rights after Slesingers death to the Walt Disney Company which has made many Pooh cartoon movies a Disney Channel television show as well as Pooh-related merchandise. In 2001 the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for 350m. Previously Disney had been paying twice-yearly royalties to these beneficiaries. The estate of E. H. Shepard also received a sum in the deal. The UK copyright on the text of the original Winnie the Pooh books expires on 1 January 2027; at the beginning of the year after the 70th anniversary of the authors death and has already expired in those countries with a PMA-50 rule. This applies to all of Milnes works except those first published posthumously. The illustrations in the Pooh books will remain under copyright until the same amount of time has passed after the illustrators death; in the UK this will be on 1 January 2047. In the US copyright will not expire until 95 years after publication for each of Milnes books first published before 1978 but this includes the illustrations. In 2008 a collection of original illustrations featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and his animal friends sold for more than 1.2 million at auction in Sothebys London.Forbes magazine ranked Winnie the Pooh the most valuable fictional character in 2002; Winnie the Pooh merchandising products alone had annual sales of more than 5.9 billion. In 2005 Winnie the Pooh generated 6 billion a figure surpassed only by Mickey Mouse. A memorial plaque in Ashdown Forest unveiled by Christopher Robin in 1979 commemorates the work of A. A. Milne and Shepard in creating the world of Pooh. The inscription states they captured the magic of Ashdown Forest and gave it to the world. Milne once wrote of Ashdown Forest In that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing. In 2003 Winnie-the-Pooh was ranked number 7 on the BBCs The Big Read poll which determined the UKs best-loved novels. In 2006 Winnie-the-Pooh received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame marking the 80th birthday of Milnes creation. Marking the 90th anniversary of Milnes creation of the character and the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II Winnie-the-Pooh Meets the Queen sees Pooh meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace. The illustrated and audio adventure is narrated by the actor Jim Broadbent. Also in 2016 a new character a Penguin was unveiled in The Best Bear in All the World which was inspired by a long-lost photograph of Milne and his son Christopher with a toy penguin. An exhibition entitled Winnie-the-Pooh Exploring a Classic appeared at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from 9 December 2017 to 8 April 2018. Several of Milnes childrens poems were set to music by the composer Harold Fraser-Simson. His poems have been parodied many times including with the books When We Were Rather Older and Now We Are Sixty. The 1963 film The Kings Breakfast was based on Milnes poem of the same name. Milne has been portrayed in television and film. Domhnall Gleeson plays him in Goodbye Christopher Robin a 2017 biographical drama film. In the 2018 fantasy film Christopher Robin an extension of the Disney Winnie the Pooh franchise Tristan Sturrock plays Milne and filming took place at Ashdown Forest. An elementary school in Houston Texas operated by the Houston Independent School District is named after Milne. The school A. A. Milne Elementary School in Brays Oaks opened in 1991. The original manuscripts for Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner are archived at Trinity College Library Cambridge. The bulk of A. A. Milnes papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The collection established at the center in 1964 consists of manuscript drafts and fragments for over 150 of Milnes works as well as correspondence legal documents genealogical records and some personal effects. The library division holds several books formerly belonging to Milne and his wife Dorothy. The center also has small collections of correspondence from Christopher Robin Milne and Milnes frequent illustrator E. H. Shepard. Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion although he used religious terms to explain his decision while remaining a pacifist to join the British Home Guard. He wrote In fighting Hitler we are truly fighting the Devil the Anti-Christ ... Hitler was a crusader against God. His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism agnosticism disbelief call it what you will than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema motor bicycle and golf course.

Beatrix Potter,Helen Beatrix Potter was an English writer illustrator natural scientist and conservationist. She is best known for her childrens books featuring animals such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit which was her first commercially published work in 1902. Her books including 23 Tales have sold more than 250 million copies. An entrepreneur Potter was a pioneer of character merchandising. In 1903 Peter Rabbit was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy making him the oldest licensed character. Born into an upper-middle-class household Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children. She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District developing a love of landscape flora and fauna all of which she closely observed and painted. Potters study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology. In her thirties Potter self-published the highly successful childrens book The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Following this Potter began writing and illustrating childrens books full-time. Potter wrote over sixty books with the best known being her twenty-three childrens tales. With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt in 1905 Potter bought Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey a village in the Lake District. Over the following decades she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913 at the age of 47 she married William Heelis a respected local solicitor with an office in Hawkshead. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate and to design spin-off merchandise based on her childrens books for British publisher Warne until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue. Potter died of pneumonia and heart disease on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at the age of 77 leaving almost all her property to the National Trust. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the Lake District National Park. Potters books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in songs films ballet and animations and her life is depicted in two films and a television series. Potters family on both sides were from the Manchester area. They were English Unitarians associated with dissenting Protestant congregations influential in 19th century England that affirmed the oneness of God and that rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Potters paternal grandfather Edmund Potter from Glossop in Derbyshire owned what was then the largest calico printing works in England and later served as a Member of Parliament. Potters father Rupert William Potter was educated at Manchester College by the Unitarian philosopher James Martineau. He then trained as a barrister in London. Rupert practised law specialising in equity law and conveyancing. He married Helen Leech on 8 August 1863 at Hyde Unitarian Chapel Gee Cross. Helen was the daughter of Jane Ashton and John Leech a wealthy cotton merchant and shipbuilder from Stalybridge. Helens first cousins were siblings Harriet Lupton and Thomas Ashton 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde. It was reported in July 2014 that Potter had personally given a number of her own original hand-painted illustrations to the two daughters of Arthur and Harriet Lupton who were cousins to both Beatrix Potter and Catherine Princess of Wales. Potters parents lived comfortably at 2 Bolton Gardens West Brompton London where Helen Beatrix was born on 28 July 1866 and her brother Walter Bertram on 14 March 1872. The house was destroyed in the Blitz. Bousfield Primary School now stands where the house once was. A blue plaque on the school building testifies to the former site of the Potter home. Both parents were artistically talented and Rupert was an adept amateur photographer. Rupert had invested in the stock market and by the early 1890s he was extremely wealthy. Beatrix Potter was educated by three governesses the last of whom was Annie Moore just three years older than Potter who tutored Potter in German as well as acting as ladys companion. She and Potter remained friends throughout their lives and Annies eight children were the recipients of many of Potters picture letters. It was Annie who later suggested that these letters might make good childrens books. She and her younger brother Walter Bertram grew up with few friends outside their large extended family. Her parents were artistic interested in nature and enjoyed the countryside. As children Potter and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly. In their schoolroom Potter and Bertram kept a variety of small petsmice rabbits a hedgehog and some bats along with collections of butterflies and other insectswhich they drew and studied. Potter was devoted to the care of her small animals often taking them with her on long holidays. In most of the first fifteen years of her life Potter spent summer holidays at Dalguise an estate on the River Tay in Perthshire Scotland. There she sketched and explored an area that nourished her imagination and her observation. Her first sketchbook from those holidays kept at age 8 and dated 1875 is held at and has been digitised by the Victoria Albert Museum London. Potter and her brother were allowed great freedom in the country and both children became adept students of natural history. In 1882 when Dalguise was no longer available the Potters took their first summer holiday in the Lake District at Wray Castle near Lake Windermere. Here Potter met Hardwicke Rawnsley vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the National Trust whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in Potter and who was to have a lasting impact on her life. At about the age of 14 Potter began to keep a diary written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising. Her Journal was important to the development of her creativity serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment. In tiny handwriting she reported on society recorded her impressions of art and artists recounted stories and observed life around her. The Journal deciphered and transcribed by Leslie Linder in 1958 does not provide an intimate record of her personal life but it is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. It describes Potters maturing artistic and intellectual interests her often amusing insights into the places she visited and her unusual ability to observe nature and to describe it. Started in 1881 her journal ends in 1897 when her artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish her drawings. Precocious but reserved and often bored she was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of her own while dutifully taking care of her parents dealing with her especially demanding mother and managing their various households. Beatrix Potters parents did not discourage higher education. As was common in the Victorian era women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university. Beatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science except astronomy.Botany was a passion for most Victorians and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. She collected fossils studied archaeological artefacts from London excavations and was interested in entomology. In all these areas she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s her scientific interests centred on mycology. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in Perthshire in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations taught her taxonomy and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced Potter began microscopic drawings of fungus spores and in 1895 developed a theory of their germination. Through the connections of her uncle Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe a chemist and vice-chancellor of the University of London she consulted with botanists at Kew Gardens convincing George Massee of her ability to germinate spores and her theory of hybridisation. She did not believe in the theory of symbiosis proposed by Simon Schwendener the German mycologist as previously thought; instead she proposed a more independent process of reproduction. Rebuffed by William Thiselton-Dyer the Director at Kew because of her sex and her amateur status Potter wrote up her conclusions and submitted a paper On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae to the Linnean Society in 1897. It was introduced by Massee because as a female Potter could not attend proceedings or read her paper. She subsequently withdrew it realising that some of her samples were contaminated but continued her microscopic studies for several more years. Her paper has only recently been rediscovered along with the rich artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied it. Her work is only now being properly evaluated. Potter later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the Armitt Museum and Library in Ambleside where mycologists still refer to them to identify fungi. There is also a collection of her fungus paintings at the Perth Museum and Art Gallery in Perth Scotland donated by Charles McIntosh. In 1967 the mycologist W. P. K. Findlay included many of Potters beautifully accurate fungus drawings in his Wayside Woodland Fungi thereby fulfilling her desire to one day have her fungus drawings published in a book. In 1997 the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to Potter for the sexism displayed in its handling of her research. Potters artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairy tales and fantasy. She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe. As well as stories from the Old Testament John Bunyans The Pilgrims Progress and Harriet Beecher Stowes Uncle Toms Cabin she grew up with Aesops Fables the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen Charles Kingsleys The Water Babies the folk tales and mythology of Scotland the German Romantics Shakespeare and the romances of Sir Walter Scott. As a young child before the age of eight Edward Lears A Book of Nonsense including the much loved The Owl and the Pussycat and Lewis Carrolls Alice in Wonderland had made their impression although she later said of Alice that she was more interested in Tenniels illustrations than what they were about. The Brer Rabbit stories of Joel Chandler Harris had been family favourites and she later studied his Uncle Remus stories and illustrated them. She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes but the work of the picture book triumvirate Walter Crane Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father was a great influence. When she started to illustrate she chose first the traditional rhymes and stories Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves Puss-in-boots and Red Riding Hood. However most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets mice rabbits kittens and guinea pigs. In her teenage years Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London. Her Journal reveals her growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her fathers friend the artist Sir John Everett Millais who recognised Potters talent of observation. Although Potter was aware of art and artistic trends her drawing and her prose style were uniquely her own. As a way to earn money in the 1890s Potter printed Christmas cards of her own design as well as cards for special occasions. These were her first commercially successful works as an illustrator. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings. In 1890 the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of the drawings of her rabbit Benjamin Bunny to illustrate verses by Frederic Weatherly titled A Happy Pair. In 1893 the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherlys Our Dear Relations another book of rhymes and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for Changing Pictures a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories. Whenever Potter went on holiday to the Lake District or Scotland she sent letters to young friends illustrating them with quick sketches. Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore particularly to Moores eldest son Noel who was often ill. In September 1893 Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in Dunkeld Perthshire. She had run out of things to say to Noel and so she told him a story about four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy Mopsy Cottontail and Peter. It became one of the most famous childrens letters ever written and the basis of Potters future career as a writer-artist-storyteller. In 1900 Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits and fashioned a dummy book of it it has been suggested in imitation of Helen Bannermans 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the work she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Rawnsley had great faith in Potters tale recast it in didactic verse and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. Frederick Warne Co had previously rejected the tale but eager to compete in the booming small format childrens book market reconsidered and accepted the bunny book following the recommendation of their prominent childrens book artist L. Leslie Brooke. The firm declined Rawnsleys verse in favour of Potters original prose and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations choosing the new Hentschel three-colour process to reproduce her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was published and was an immediate success. It was followed the next year by The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with Norman Warne as her editor Potter published two or three little books each year 23 books in all. The last book in this format was Cecily Parsleys Nursery Rhymes in 1922 a collection of favourite rhymes. Although The Tale of Little Pig Robinson was not published until 1930 it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the First World War when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming sheep-breeding and land conservation. The immense popularity of Potters books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations the non-didactic nature of her stories the depiction of the rural countryside and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters. Potter was also a canny businesswoman. As early as 1903 she made and patented a Peter Rabbit doll. It was followed by other spin-off merchandise over the years including painting books board games wall-paper figurines baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by Frederick Warne Co and earned Potter an independent income as well as immense profits for her publisher. In 1905 Potter and Norman Warne became unofficially engaged. Potters parents objected to the match because Warne was in trade and thus not socially suitable. The engagement lasted only one monthWarne died of pernicious anaemia at age 37. That same year Potter used some of her income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey in the English Lake District near Windermere. Potter and Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm would be their holiday home but after Warnes death Potter went ahead with its purchase as she had always wanted to own that farm and live in that charming village. The tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of fell farming and of raising livestock including pigs cows and chickens; the following year she added sheep. Realising she needed to protect her boundaries she sought advice from W.H. Heelis Son a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby Hawkshead. With William Heelis acting for her she bought contiguous pasture and in 1909 the 20 acres Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm. She visited Hill Top at every opportunity and her books written during this period reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living. Owning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis. By the summer of 1912 Heelis had proposed marriage and Potter had accepted; although she did not immediately tell her parents who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at St Mary Abbots in Kensington. The couple moved immediately to Near Sawrey residing at Castle Cottage the renovated farmhouse on Castle Farm which was 34 acres large. Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potters private studio and workshop. At last her own woman Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life her country solicitor husband and his large family her farms the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck and The Tale of Tom Kitten are representative of Hill Top Farm and her farming life and reflect her happiness with her country life. Rupert Potter died in 1914 and with the outbreak of World War I Potter now a wealthy woman persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for her to rent in Sawrey. Finding life in Sawrey dull Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in Bowness on the other side of Lake Windermere. Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne Co and fully participated in country life. She established a Nursing Trust for local villages and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues. Soon after acquiring Hill Top Farm Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of Herdwick sheep the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called Troutbeck Park Farm formerly a deer park restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep and for her employment of the best shepherds sheep breeders and farm managers. By the late 1920s Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders Association the first time a woman had been elected but died before taking office. In one of her diary entries whilst travelling through Wales Potter complained about the Welsh language. She wrote Machynlleth wretched town hardly a person could speak English continuing Welsh seem a pleasant intelligent race but I should think awkward to live with... the language is past description. Potter had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley the first secretary and founding member of the National Trust. According to the National Trust she supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development. Potter was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts and period furniture as well as local stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the Herdwick sheep but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire including the Tarn Hows. Potter was the de facto estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to repurchase most of the property from her. Potters stewardship of these farms earned her full regard but she was not without her critics not the least of which were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of afforestation preserving the intact grazing lands and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with Galloway cattle. Potter continued to write stories and to draw although mostly for her own pleasure. In 1922 Cecily Parsleys Nursery Rhymes a collection of traditional English nursery rhymes was published. Her books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical The Fairy Caravan a fanciful tale set in her beloved Troutbeck fells. It was published only in the US during Potters lifetime and not until 1952 in the UK. Sister Anne Potters version of the story of Bluebeard was written for her American readers but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale Wag by Wall was published posthumously by The Horn Book Magazine in 1944. Potter was a generous patron of the Girl Guides whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman. Potter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years continuing their farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of World War II. Although they were childless Potter played an important role in Williams large family particularly enjoying her relationship with several nieces whom she helped educate and giving comfort and aid to her husbands brothers and sisters. Potter died of complications from pneumonia and heart disease on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage and her remains were cremated at Carleton Crematorium Blackpool. She left nearly all her property to the National Trust including over 4000 acres of land sixteen farms cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. Hers was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust and it enabled the preservation of the land now included in the Lake District National Park and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in Swindon was named Heelis in 2005 in her memory. William Heelis continued his stewardship of their properties and of her literary and artistic work for the twenty months he survived her. When he died in August 1945 he left the remainder to the National Trust. Potter left almost all the original illustrations for her books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to her publisher Frederick Warne Co now a division of the Penguin Group. On 1 January 2014 the copyright expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when it was moved to William Heeliss former law offices in Hawkshead also owned by the National Trust as the Beatrix Potter Gallery. Potter gave her folios of mycological drawings to the Armitt Library and Museum in Ambleside before her death. The Tale of Peter Rabbit is owned by Warne The Tailor of Gloucester by the Tate Gallery and The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies by the British Museum. Beatrix Potter was the first to recognise that contentas we now call the stuff that makes up a book or a filmwas only the beginning. In 1903 Peter hopped outside his pages to become a patented soft toy which gave him the distinction of being not only Mr. McGregors mortal enemy but also becoming the first licensed character. In 1903 Potter created the first Peter Rabbit soft toy and registered him at the Patent Office in London making Peter the oldest licensed fictional character. Merchandise of Peter and other Potter characters have been sold at Harrods department store in London since at least 1910 when the range first appeared in their catalogues. Along with her writing Potter would continue to oversee merchandising and licensing opportunities for her characters. On her legacy Nicholas Tucker in The Guardian writes she was the first author to license fictional characters to a range of toys and household objects still on sale today. In an article by the Smithsonian magazine titled How Beatrix Potter Invented Character Merchandising Joy Lanzendorfer writes Potter was also an entrepreneur and a pioneer in licensing and merchandising literary characters. Potter built a retail empire out of her bunny book that is worth 500 million today. In the process she created a system that continues to benefit all licensed characters from Mickey Mouse to Harry Potter. The largest public collection of her letters and drawings is the Leslie Linder Bequest and Leslie Linder Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In the United States the largest public collections are those in the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Cotsen Childrens Library at Princeton University. In 2015 a manuscript for an unpublished book was discovered by Jo Hanks a publisher at Penguin Random House Childrens Books in the Victoria and Albert Museum archive. The book The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots with illustrations by Quentin Blake was published 1 September 2016 to mark the 150th anniversary of Potters birth. Also in 2016 Peter Rabbit was depicted on the reverse of a British fifty pence coin and Peter along with other Potter characters featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. In 2017 The Art of Beatrix Potter Sketches Paintings and Illustrations by Emily Zach was published after San Francisco publisher Chronicle Books decided to mark the 150th anniversary of Beatrix Potters birth by showing that she was far more than a 19th-century weekend painter. She was an artist of astonishing range. In December 2017 the asteroid 13975 Beatrixpotter discovered by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst in 1992 was named in her memory. In 2022 an exhibition Beatrix Potter Drawn to Nature was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Research for the exhibition identified the mans court waistcoat c. 1780s which inspired Potters sketch in The Tailor of Gloucester. There are many interpretations of Potters literary work the sources of her art and her life and times. These include critical evaluations of her corpus of childrens literature and Modernist interpretations of Humphrey Carpenter and Katherine Chandler. Judy Taylor That Naughty Rabbit Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit tells the story of the first publication and many editions. Potters country life her farming and role as a landscape perservationist are discussed in the work of Matthew Kelly The Women Who Saved the English Countryside .

In 1971 a ballet film was released The Tales of Beatrix Potter directed by Reginald Mills set to music by John Lanchbery with choreography by Frederick Ashton and performed in character costume by members of the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera House orchestra. The ballet of the same name has been performed by other dance companies around the world. In 1992 Potters childrens book The Tale of Benjamin Bunny was featured in the film Lorenzos Oil. Potter is also featured in Susan Wittig Alberts series of light mysteries called The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter. The first of the eight-book series is Tale of Hill Top Farm which deals with Potters life in the Lake District and the village of Near Sawrey between 1905 and 1913. In 1982 the BBC produced The Tale of Beatrix Potter. This dramatization of her life was written by John Hawkesworth directed by Bill Hayes and starred Holly Aird and Penelope Wilton as the young and adult Potter respectively. The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends a TV series based on nine of her twenty-four stories starred actress Niamh Cusack as Beatrix Potter. In 1993 Weston Woods Studios made an almost hour non-story film called Beatrix Potter Artist Storyteller and Countrywoman with narration by Lynn Redgrave. In 2006 Chris Noonan directed Miss Potter a biographical film of Potters life focusing on her early career and romance with her editor Norman Warne. The film stars Renée Zellweger as Beatrix Potter Ewan McGregor as Norman Warne and Emily Watson as Warnes sister. On 9 February 2018 Columbia Pictures released Peter Rabbit directed by Will Gluck based on the work by Potter. The character Bea played by Rose Byrne is a re-imagined version of Potter.

He is best known as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia but he is also noted for his other works of fiction such as The Screwtape Letters and The Space Trilogy and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics including Mere Christianity Miracles and The Problem of Pain. Lewis was a close friend of J.R.R. Tolkien author of The Lord of the Rings. Both men served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to Lewiss 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy he was baptized in the Church of Ireland but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32 owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends and he became an ordinary layman of the Church of England. Lewiss faith profoundly affected his work and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim. Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage TV radio and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian scholars from many denominations. In 1956 Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure one week before his 65th birthday. In 2013 on the 50th anniversary of his death Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey. Clive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in Ulster Ireland on 29 November 1898. His father was Albert James Lewis a solicitor whose father Richard Lewis had come to Ireland from Wales during the mid-19th century. Lewiss mother was Florence Augusta Lewis Hamilton known as Flora the daughter of Thomas Hamilton a Church of Ireland priest and the great-granddaughter of both Bishop Hugh Hamilton and John Staples. Lewis had an elder brother Warren Hamilton Lewis . He was baptized on 29 January 1899 by his maternal grandfather in St Marks Church Dundela. When his dog Jacksie was killed by a car the four-year old Lewis adopted the name Jacksie. At first he would answer to no other name but later accepted Jack the name by which he was known to friends and family for the rest of his life. When he was seven his family moved into Little Lea the family home of his childhood in the Strandtown area of East Belfast. As a boy Lewis was fascinated with anthropomorphic animals; he fell in love with Beatrix Potters stories and often wrote and illustrated his own animal tales. Along with his brother Warnie he created the world of Boxen a fantasy land inhabited and run by animals. Lewis loved to read from an early age. His fathers house was filled with books; he later wrote that finding something to read was as easy as walking into a field and finding a new blade of grass. The New House is almost a major character in my story.I am the product of long corridors empty sunlit roomsupstair indoor silences attics explored in solitudedistant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipesand the noise of wind under the tiles. Also of endless books. Lewis was schooled by private tutors until age nine when his mother died in 1908 from cancer. His father then sent him to England to live and study at Wynyard School in Watford Hertfordshire. Lewiss brother had enrolled there three years previously. Not long after the school was closed due to a lack of pupils. Lewis then attended Campbell College in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home but left after a few months due to respiratory problems. He was then sent back to England to the health-resort town of Malvern Worcestershire where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House which Lewis referred to as Chartres in his autobiography. It was during this time that he abandoned the Christianity he was taught as a child and became an atheist. During this time he also developed a fascination with European mythology and the occult. In September 1913 Lewis enrolled at Malvern College where he remained until the following June. He found the school socially competitive. After leaving Malvern he studied privately with William T. Kirkpatrick his fathers old tutor and former headmaster of Lurgan College. As a teenager Lewis was wonderstruck by the songs and legends of what he called Northernness the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the Icelandic sagas. These legends intensified an inner longing that he would later call joy. He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature. His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen and he began experimenting with different art forms such as epic poetry and opera to try to capture his new-found interest in Norse mythology and the natural world. Studying with Kirkpatrick instilled in him a love of Greek literature and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills. In 1916 Lewis was awarded a scholarship at University College Oxford. Lewis experienced a certain cultural shock on first arriving in England No Englishman will be able to understand my first impressions of England Lewis wrote in Surprised by Joy. The strange English accents with which I was surrounded seemed like the voices of demons. But what was worst was the English landscape... I have made up the quarrel since; but at that moment I conceived a hatred for England which took many years to heal. From boyhood Lewis had immersed himself in Norse and Greek mythology and later in Irish mythology and literature. He also expressed an interest in the Irish language though there is not much evidence that he laboured to learn it. He developed a particular fondness for W. B. Yeats in part because of Yeatss use of Irelands Celtic heritage in poetry. In a letter to a friend Lewis wrote I have here discovered an author exactly after my own heart whom I am sure you would delight in W. B. Yeats. He writes plays and poems of rare spirit and beauty about our old Irish mythology. In 1921 Lewis met Yeats twice since Yeats had moved to Oxford. Lewis was surprised to find his English peers indifferent to Yeats and the Celtic Revival movement and wrote I am often surprised to find how utterly ignored Yeats is among the men I have met perhaps his appeal is purely Irish if so then thank the gods that I am Irish. Early in his career Lewis considered sending his work to the major Dublin publishers writing If I do ever send my stuff to a publisher I think I shall try Maunsel those Dublin people and so tack myself definitely onto the Irish school. After his conversion to Christianity his interests gravitated towards Christian theology and away from pagan Celtic mysticism . Lewis occasionally expressed a somewhat tongue-in-cheek chauvinism towards the English. Describing an encounter with a fellow Irishman he wrote Like all Irish people who meet in England we ended by criticisms on the invincible flippancy and dullness of the Anglo-Saxon race. After all there is no doubt ami that the Irish are the only people with all their faults I would not gladly live or die among another folk. Throughout his life he sought out the company of other Irish people living in England and visited Northern Ireland regularly. In 1958 he spent his honeymoon there at the Old Inn Crawfordsburn which he called my Irish life. Various critics have suggested that it was Lewiss dismay over the sectarian conflict in his native Belfast which led him to eventually adopt such an ecumenical brand of Christianity. As one critic has said Lewis repeatedly extolled the virtues of all branches of the Christian faith emphasising a need for unity among Christians around what the Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton called Mere Christianity the core doctrinal beliefs that all denominations share. On the other hand Paul Stevens of the University of Toronto has written that Lewis mere Christianity masked many of the political prejudices of an old-fashioned Ulster Protestant a native of middle-class Belfast for whom British withdrawal from Northern Ireland even in the 1950s and 1960s was unthinkable. Lewis entered Oxford in the 1917 summer term studying at University College and shortly after he joined the Officers Training Corps at the university as his most promising route into the army. From there he was drafted into a Cadet Battalion for training. After his training he was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry of the British Army as a Second Lieutenant and was later transferred to the 1st Battalion of the regiment then serving in France . Within months of entering Oxford he was shipped by the British Army to France to fight in the First World War. On his 19th birthday Lewis arrived at the front line in the Somme Valley in France where he experienced trench warfare for the first time. On 15 April 1918 as 1st Battalion Somerset Light Infantry assaulted the village of Riez du Vinage in the midst of the German spring offensive Lewis was wounded and two of his colleagues were killed by a British shell falling short of its target. He was depressed and homesick during his convalescence and upon his recovery in October he was assigned to duty in Andover England. He was demobilized in December 1918 and soon restarted his studies. In a later letter Lewis stated that his experience of the horrors of war along with the loss of his mother and unhappiness in school were the basis of his pessimism and atheism. After Lewis returned to Oxford University he received a First in Honour Moderations in 1920 a First in Greats in 1922 and a First in English in 1923. In 1924 he became a Philosophy tutor at University College and in 1925 was elected a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College where he served for 29 years until 1954. During his army training Lewis shared a room with another cadet Edward Courtnay Francis Paddy Moore . Maureen Moore Paddys sister said that the two made a mutual pact that if either died during the war the survivor would take care of both of their families. Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise. Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother Janie King Moore and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis who was 18 when they met and Janie who was 45. The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital as his father did not visit him. Lewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalized in the late 1940s. He routinely introduced her as his mother referred to her as such in letters and developed a deeply affectionate friendship with her. Lewiss own mother had died when he was a child while his father was distant demanding and eccentric. Speculation regarding their relationship resurfaced with the 1990 publication of A. N. Wilsons biography of Lewis. Wilson attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time. Wilsons biography was not the first to address the question of Lewiss relationship with Moore. George Sayer knew Lewis for 29 years and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years before Lewiss conversion to Christianity. In his biography Jack A Life of C. S. Lewis he wrote Were they lovers Owen Barfield who knew Jack well in the 1920s once said that he thought the likelihood was fifty-fifty. Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack she was still a handsome woman and he was certainly infatuated with her. But it seems very odd if they were lovers that he would call her mother. We know too that they did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother. Later Sayer changed his mind. In the introduction to the 1997 edition of his biography of Lewis he wrote I have had to alter my opinion of Lewiss relationship with Mrs. Moore. In chapter eight of this book I wrote that I was uncertain about whether they were lovers. Now after conversations with Mrs. Moores daughter Maureen and a consideration of the way in which their bedrooms were arranged at The Kilns I am quite certain that they were. However the romantic nature of the relationship is doubted by other writers; for example Philip Zaleski and Carol Zaleski write in The Fellowship that Whenor whetherLewis commenced an affair with Mrs. Moore remains unclear. Lewis spoke well of Mrs. Moore throughout his life saying to his friend George Sayer She was generous and taught me to be generous too. In December 1917 Lewis wrote in a letter to his childhood friend Arthur Greeves that Janie and Greeves were the two people who matter most to me in the world. In 1930 Lewis moved into The Kilns with his brother Warnie Mrs. Moore and her daughter Maureen. The Kilns was a house in the district of Headington Quarry on the outskirts of Oxford now part of the suburb of Risinghurst. They all contributed financially to the purchase of the house which eventually passed to Maureen who by then was Dame Maureen Dunbar when Warren died in 1973. Moore had dementia in her later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home where she died in 1951. Lewis visited her every day in this home until her death. Lewis was raised in a religious family that attended the Church of Ireland. He became an atheist at age 15 though he later described his young self as being paradoxically very angry with God for not existing and equally angry with him for creating a world. His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and a duty; around this time he also gained an interest in the occult as his studies expanded to include such topics. Lewis quoted Lucretius as having one of the strongest arguments for atheism Had God designed the world it would not beA world so frail and faulty as we see. Lewiss interest in the works of the Scottish writer George MacDonald was part of what turned him from atheism. This can be seen particularly well through this passage in Lewiss The Great Divorce chapter nine when the semi-autobiographical main character meets MacDonald in Heaven He eventually returned to Christianity having been influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and friend J. R. R. Tolkien whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926 as well as the book The Everlasting Man by G. K. Chesterton. Lewis vigorously resisted conversion noting that he was brought into Christianity like a prodigal kicking struggling resentful and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape. He described his last struggle in Surprised by Joy You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen night after night feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work the steady unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in and admitted that God was God and knelt and prayed perhaps that night the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England. After his conversion to theism in 1929 Lewis converted to Christianity in 1931 following a long discussion during a late-night walk along Addisons Walk with close friends Tolkien and Hugo Dyson. He records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on his way to the zoo with his brother. He became a member of the Church of England somewhat to the disappointment of Tolkien who had hoped that he would join the Catholic Church. Lewis was a committed Anglican who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology though in his apologetic writings he made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination. In his later writings some believe that he proposed ideas such as purification of venial sins after death in purgatory and mortal sin which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings although they are also widely held in Anglicanism . Regardless Lewis considered himself an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of his life reflecting that he had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons. He later came to consider himself honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns. After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the Lewises took child evacuees from London and other cities into The Kilns. Lewis was only 40 when the war began and he tried to re-enter military service offering to instruct cadets; however his offer was not accepted. He rejected the recruiting offices suggestion of writing columns for the Ministry of Information in the press as he did not want to write lies to deceive the enemy. He later served in the local Home Guard in Oxford. From 1941 to 1943 Lewis spoke on religious programmes broadcast by the BBC from London while the city was under periodic air raids. These broadcasts were appreciated by civilians and servicemen at that stage. For example Air Chief Marshal Sir Donald Hardman wrote The youthful Alistair Cooke was less impressed and in 1944 described the alarming vogue of Mr. C.S. Lewis as an example of how wartime tends to spawn so many quack religions and Messiahs. The broadcasts were anthologized in Mere Christianity. From 1941 Lewis was occupied at his summer holiday weekends visiting R.A.F. stations to speak on his faith invited by Chaplain-in-Chief Maurice Edwards. It was also during the same wartime period that Lewis was invited to become first President of the Oxford Socratic Club in January 1942 a position that he enthusiastically held until he resigned on appointment to Cambridge University in 1954. Lewis was named on the last list of honours by George VI in December 1951 as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire but declined so as to avoid association with any political issues. In 1954 Lewis accepted the newly founded chair in Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature at Magdalene College Cambridge where he finished his career. He maintained a strong attachment to the city of Oxford keeping a home there and returning on weekends until his death in 1963. She was my daughter and my mother my pupil and my teacher my subject and my sovereign; and always holding all these in solution my trusty comrade friend shipmate fellow-soldier. My mistress; but at the same time all that any man friend has ever been to me. Perhaps more. In later life Lewis corresponded with Joy Davidman Gresham an American writer of Jewish background a former Communist and a convert from atheism to Christianity. She was separated from her alcoholic and abusive husband novelist William L. Gresham and came to England with her two sons David and Douglas. Lewis at first regarded her as an agreeable intellectual companion and personal friend and it was on this level that he agreed to enter into a civil marriage contract with her so that she could continue to live in the UK. They were married at the register office 42 St Giles Oxford on 23 April 1956. Lewiss brother Warren wrote For Jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual. Joy was the only woman whom he had met... who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness in width of interest and in analytical grasp and above all in humour and a sense of fun. After complaining of a painful hip she was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer and the relationship developed to the point that they sought a Christian marriage. Since she was divorced this was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time but a friend the Rev. Peter Bide performed the ceremony at her bed in the Churchill Hospital on 21 March 1957. Greshams cancer soon went into remission and the couple lived together as a family with Warren Lewis until 1960 when her cancer recurred. She died on 13 July 1960. Earlier that year the couple took a brief holiday in Greece and the Aegean; Lewis was fond of walking but not of travel and this marked his only crossing of the English Channel after 1918. Lewiss book A Grief Observed describes his experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that he originally released it under the pseudonym N. W. Clerk to keep readers from associating the book with him. Ironically many friends recommended the book to Lewis as a method for dealing with his own grief. After Lewiss death his authorship was made public by Fabers with the permission of the executors. Lewis continued to raise Greshams two sons after her death. Douglas Gresham is a Christian like Lewis and his mother while David Gresham turned to his mothers ancestral faith becoming Orthodox Jewish in his beliefs. His mothers writings had featured the Jews in an unsympathetic manner particularly on shohet . David informed Lewis that he was going to become a ritual slaughterer to present this type of Jewish religious functionary to the world in a more favourable light. In a 2005 interview Douglas Gresham acknowledged that he and his brother were not close although they had corresponded via email. David died on 25 December 2014. In 2020 Douglas revealed that his brother had died at a Swiss mental hospital and that when David was a young man he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. In early June 1961 Lewis began experiencing nephritis which resulted in blood poisoning. His illness caused him to miss the autumn term at Cambridge though his health gradually began improving in 1962 and he returned that April. His health continued to improve and according to his friend George Sayer Lewis was fully himself by early 1963. On 15 July that year Lewis fell ill and was admitted to the hospital; he had a heart attack at 500pm the next day and lapsed into a coma but unexpectedly woke the following day at 200pm. After he was discharged from the hospital Lewis returned to the Kilns though he was too ill to return to work. As a result he resigned from his post at Cambridge in August 1963. Lewiss condition continued to decline and he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure in mid-November. He collapsed in his bedroom at 530pm on 22 November exactly one week before his 65th birthday and died a few minutes later. He is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church Headington Oxford. His brother Warren died on 9 April 1973 and was buried in the same grave. Media coverage of Lewiss death was almost completely overshadowed by news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy which occurred on the same day as did the death of English writer Aldous Huxley author of Brave New World. This coincidence was the inspiration for Peter Kreefts book Between Heaven and Hell A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy C. S. Lewis Aldous Huxley. Lewis is commemorated on 22 November in the church calendar of the Episcopal Church. Lewis began his academic career as an undergraduate student at Oxford University where he won a triple first the highest honours in three areas of study. He was then elected a Fellow of Magdalen College Oxford where he worked for nearly thirty years from 1925 to 1954. In 1954 he was awarded the newly founded chair of Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge University and was elected a fellow of Magdalene College. Concerning his appointed academic field he argued that there was no such thing as an English Renaissance. Much of his scholarly work concentrated on the later Middle Ages especially its use of allegory. His The Allegory of Love helped reinvigorate the serious study of late medieval narratives such as the Roman de la Rose. Lewis was commissioned to write the volume English Literature in the Sixteenth Century for the Oxford History of English Literature. His book A Preface to Paradise Lost is still cited as a criticism of that work. His last academic work The Discarded Image An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature is a summary of the medieval world view a reference to the discarded image of the cosmos. Lewis was a prolific writer and his circle of literary friends became an informal discussion society known as the Inklings including J. R. R. Tolkien Nevill Coghill Lord David Cecil Charles Williams Owen Barfield and his brother Warren Lewis. Glyer points to December 1929 as the Inklings beginning date. Lewiss friendship with Coghill and Tolkien grew during their time as members of the Kolbítar an Old Norse reading group that Tolkien founded and which ended around the time of the inception of the Inklings. At Oxford he was the tutor of poet John Betjeman critic Kenneth Tynan mystic Bede Griffiths novelist Roger Lancelyn Green and Sufi scholar Martin Lings among many other undergraduates. The religious and conservative Betjeman detested Lewis whereas the anti-establishment Tynan retained a lifelong admiration for him. When I began teaching for the English Faculty I made two other friends both Christians who were later to give me much help in getting over the last stile. They were HVV Dyson... and JRR Tolkien. Friendship with the latter marked the breakdown of two old prejudices. At my first coming into the world I had been warned never to trust a Papist and at my first coming into the English Faculty never to trust a philologist. Tolkien was both. In addition to his scholarly work Lewis wrote several popular novels including the science fiction Space Trilogy for adults and the Narnia fantasies for children. Most deal implicitly with Christian themes such as sin humanitys fall from grace and redemption. His first novel after becoming a Christian was The Pilgrims Regress which depicted his experience with Christianity in the style of John Bunyans The Pilgrims Progress. The book was poorly received by critics at the time although David Martyn Lloyd-Jones one of Lewiss contemporaries at Oxford gave him much-valued encouragement. Asked by Lloyd-Jones when he would write another book Lewis replied When I understand the meaning of prayer. The Space Trilogy dealt with what Lewis saw as the dehumanizing trends in contemporary science fiction. The first book Out of the Silent Planet was apparently written following a conversation with his friend J. R. R. Tolkien about these trends. Lewis agreed to write a space travel story and Tolkien a time travel one but Tolkien never completed The Lost Road linking his Middle-earth to the modern world. Lewiss main character Elwin Ransom is based in part on Tolkien a fact to which Tolkien alludes in his letters. The second novel Perelandra depicts a new Garden of Eden on the planet Venus a new Adam and Eve and a new serpent figure to tempt Eve. The story can be seen as an account of what might have happened if the terrestrial Adam had defeated the serpent and avoided the Fall of Man with Ransom intervening in the novel to ransom the new Adam and Eve from the deceptions of the enemy. The third novel That Hideous Strength develops the theme of nihilistic science threatening traditional human values embodied in Arthurian legend. Many ideas in the trilogy particularly opposition to dehumanization as portrayed in the third book are presented more formally in The Abolition of Man based on a series of lectures by Lewis at Durham University in 1943. Lewis stayed in Durham where he says he was overwhelmed by the magnificence of the cathedral. That Hideous Strength is in fact set in the environs of Edgestow university a small English university like Durham though Lewis disclaims any other resemblance between the two. Walter Hooper Lewiss literary executor discovered a fragment of another science-fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called The Dark Tower. Ransom appears in the story but it is not clear whether the book was intended as part of the same series of novels. The manuscript was eventually published in 1977 though Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog doubts its authenticity. The Chronicles of Narnia considered a classic of childrens literature is a series of seven fantasy novels. Written between 1949 and 1954 and illustrated by Pauline Baynes the series is Lewiss most popular work having sold over 100 million copies in 41 languages . It has been adapted several times complete or in part for radio television stage and cinema. The books contain Christian ideas intended to be easily accessible to young readers. In addition to Christian themes Lewis also borrows characters from Greek and Roman mythology as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales. Lewiss last novel Till We Have Faces a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche was published in 1956. Although Lewis called it far and away my best book it was not as well-reviewed as his previous work. Lewis wrote several works on Heaven and Hell. One of these The Great Divorce is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven where they are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that they can stay if they choose in which case they can call the place where they had come from Purgatory instead of Hell but many find it not to their taste. The title is a reference to William Blakes The Marriage of Heaven and Hell a concept that Lewis found a disastrous error. This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri and Bunyans The Pilgrims Progress. Another short work The Screwtape Letters which he dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien consists of letters of advice from senior demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure his damnation. Lewiss last novel was Till We Have Faces which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success. It is a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the unusual perspective of Psyches sister. It is deeply concerned with religious ideas but the setting is entirely pagan and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit. Before Lewiss conversion to Christianity he published two books Spirits in Bondage a collection of poems and Dymer a single narrative poem. Both were published under the pen name Clive Hamilton. Other narrative poems have since been published posthumously including Launcelot The Nameless Isle and The Queen of Drum. He also wrote The Four Loves which rhetorically explains four categories of love friendship eros affection and charity. In 2009 a partial draft was discovered of Language and Human Nature which Lewis had begun co-writing with J. R. R. Tolkien but which was never completed. Lewis is also regarded by many as one of the most influential Christian apologists of his time in addition to his career as an English professor and an author of fiction. Mere Christianity was voted best book of the 20th century by Christianity Today in 2000. He has been called The Apostle to the Skeptics due to his approach to religious belief as a sceptic and his following conversion. Lewis was very interested in presenting an argument from reason against metaphysical naturalism and for the existence of God. Mere Christianity The Problem of Pain and Miracles were all concerned to one degree or another with refuting popular objections to Christianity such as the question How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world He also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster and some of his writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures . According to George Sayer losing a 1948 debate with Elizabeth Anscombe also a Christian led Lewis to re-evaluate his role as an apologist and his future works concentrated on devotional literature and childrens books. Anscombe had a completely different recollection of the debates outcome and its emotional effect on Lewis. Victor Reppert also disputes Sayer listing some of Lewiss post-1948 apologetic publications including the second and revised edition of his Miracles in 1960 in which Lewis addressed Anscombes criticism. Noteworthy too is Roger Teichmans suggestion in The Philosophy of Elizabeth Anscombe that the intellectual impact of Anscombes paper on Lewiss philosophical self-confidence should not be over-rated ...it seems unlikely that he felt as irretrievably crushed as some of his acquaintances have made out; the episode is probably an inflated legend in the same category as the affair of Wittgensteins Poker. Certainly Anscombe herself believed that Lewiss argument though flawed was getting at something very important; she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of Miracles though that version also had much to criticize in it. Lewis wrote an autobiography titled Surprised by Joy which places special emphasis on his own conversion. He also wrote many essays and public speeches on Christian belief many of which were collected in God in the Dock and The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses. His most famous works the Chronicles of Narnia contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered allegory. Lewis an expert on the subject of allegory maintained that the books were not allegory and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them suppositional. As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs. Hook in December 1958 If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair represents despair he would be an allegorical figure. In reality he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours This is not allegory at all. Prior to his conversion Lewis used the word Moslem to refer to Muslims adherents of Islam; following his conversion however he started using Mohammedans and described Islam as a Christian heresy rather than an independent religion. In a much-cited passage from Mere Christianity Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God. He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity which would logically exclude that claim I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him Im ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher but I dont accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was and is the Son of God or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. Although this argument is sometimes called Lewiss trilemma Lewis did not invent it but rather developed and popularized it. It has also been used by Christian apologist Josh McDowell in his book More Than a Carpenter. It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars. Lewiss Christian apologetics and this argument in particular have been criticized. Philosopher John Beversluis described Lewiss arguments as textually careless and theologically unreliable and this particular argument as logically unsound and an example of a false dilemma. The Pluralist theologian John Hick claimed that New Testament scholars do not now support the view that Jesus claimed to be God. The Anglican New Testament scholar N. T. Wright criticizes Lewis for failing to recognize the significance of Jesuss Jewish identity and setting an oversight which at best drastically short-circuits the argument and which lays Lewis open to criticism that his argument doesnt work as history and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels although he argues that this doesnt undermine the eventual claim. Lewis used a similar argument in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe when the old Professor advises his young guests that their sisters claims of a magical world must logically be taken as either lies madness or truth. One of the main theses in Lewiss apologia is that there is a common morality known throughout humanity which he calls natural law. In the first five chapters of Mere Christianity Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere. Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it. He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles. These then are the two points that I wanted to make. First that human beings all over the earth have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in. Lewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction. In The Chronicles of Narnia he describes Universal Morality as the deep magic which everyone knew. In the second chapter of Mere Christianity Lewis recognizes that many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature... is. And he responds first to the idea that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct and second to the idea that the Moral Law is simply a social convention. In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another but that this actually argues for there existing some Real Morality to which they are comparing other moralities. Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts I have met people who exaggerate the differences because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For example one man said to me Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty then these filthy quislings did. There is no difference of moral principle here the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house. Lewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of animal morality in particular the suffering of animals as is evidenced by several of his essays most notably On Vivisection and On the Pains of Animals. Lewis continues to attract a wide readership. In 2008 The Times ranked him eleventh on their list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. Readers of his fiction are often unaware of what Lewis considered the Christian themes of his works. His Christian apologetics are read and quoted by members of many Christian denominations. In 2013 on the 50th anniversary of his death Lewis joined some of Britains greatest writers recognized at Poets Corner Westminster Abbey. The dedication service at noon on 22 November 2013 included a reading from The Last Battle by Douglas Gresham younger stepson of Lewis. Flowers were laid by Walter Hooper trustee and literary advisor to the Lewis Estate. An address was delivered by former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. The floor stone inscription is a quotation from an address by Lewis I believe in Christianity as I believe that the Sun has risen not only because I see it but because by it I see everything else. Lewis has been the subject of several biographies a few of which were written by close friends such as Roger Lancelyn Green and George Sayer. In 1985 the screenplay Shadowlands by William Nicholson dramatized Lewiss life and relationship with Joy Davidman Gresham. It was aired on British television starring Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom. This was also staged as a theatre play starring Nigel Hawthorne in 1989 and made into the 1993 feature film Shadowlands starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. Many books have been inspired by Lewis including A Severe Mercy by his correspondent and friend Sheldon Vanauken. The Chronicles of Narnia has been particularly influential. Modern childrens literature has been more or less influenced by Lewiss series such as Daniel Handlers A Series of Unfortunate Events Eoin Colfers Artemis Fowl Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials and J. K. Rowlings Harry Potter. Pullman is an atheist and is known to be sharply critical of C. S. Lewiss work accusing Lewis of featuring religious propaganda misogyny racism and emotional sadism in his books. However he has also modestly praised The Chronicles of Narnia for being a more serious work of literature in comparison with Tolkiens trivial The Lord of the Rings. Authors of adult fantasy literature such as Tim Powers have also testified to being influenced by Lewiss work. In A Sword Between the Sexes C. S. Lewis and the Gender Debates Mary Stewart Van Leeuwen finds in Lewiss work a hierarchical and essentialist view of class and gender corresponding to an upbringing during the Edwardian era. Most of Lewiss posthumous work has been edited by his literary executor Walter Hooper. Kathryn Lindskoog an independent Lewis scholar argued that Hoopers scholarship is not reliable and that he has made false statements and attributed forged works to Lewis. Lewiss stepson Douglas Gresham denies the forgery claims saying that The whole controversy thing was engineered for very personal reasons... Her fanciful theories have been pretty thoroughly discredited. A bronze statue of Lewiss character Digory from The Magicians Nephew stands in Belfasts Holywood Arches in front of the Holywood Road Library. Several C. S. Lewis Societies exist around the world including one which was founded in Oxford in 1982. The C.S. Lewis Society at the University of Oxford meets at Pusey House during term time to discuss papers on the life and works of Lewis and the other Inklings and generally appreciate all things Lewisian. Live-action film adaptations have been made of three of The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader . Lewis is featured as a main character in The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica series by James A. Owen. He is one of two characters in Mark St. Germains 2009 play Freuds Last Session which imagines a meeting between Lewis aged 40 and Sigmund Freud aged 83 at Freuds house in Hampstead London in 1939 as the Second World War is about to break out. In 2021 The Most Reluctant Convert a biographical drama about Lewiss life and conversion was released. The CS Lewis Nature Reserve on ground owned by Lewis lies behind his house The Kilns. There is public access.
Daphne du Maurier,Dame Daphne du Maurier Lady BrowningDBE was an English novelist biographer and playwright. Her parents were actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and his wife actress Muriel Beaumont. Her grandfather was George du Maurier a writer and cartoonist. Although du Maurier is classed as a romantic novelist her stories have been described as moody and resonant with overtones of the paranormal. Her bestselling works were not at first taken seriously by critics but they have since earned an enduring reputation for narrative craft. Many have been successfully adapted into films including the novels Rebecca Frenchmans Creek My Cousin Rachel and Jamaica Inn and the short stories The Birds and Dont Look Now. Du Maurier spent much of her life in Cornwall where most of her works are set. As her fame increased she became more reclusive. Daphne du Maurier was born at 24 Cumberland Terrace Regents Park London the middle of three daughters of prominent actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and actress Muriel Beaumont. Her paternal grandfather was author and Punch cartoonist George du Maurier who created the character of Svengali in the 1894 novel Trilby. Her paternal uncle Guy du Maurier was a playwright. Her mother was a paternal niece of journalist author and lecturer Comyns Beaumont. Her elder sister Angela du Maurier became an actress and later also a writer and her younger sister Jeanne du Maurier was a painter. She was a cousin of the Llewelyn Davies boys who were J. M. Barries inspiration for the characters in the play Peter Pan; or The Boy Who Wouldnt Grow Up. She was also a cousin of director Gabrielle Beaumont. As a child du Maurier met many prominent theatre actors because of the celebrity of her father. On meeting Tallulah Bankhead du Maurier was quoted as saying that Bankhead was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen. Du Maurier spent her childhood at Cannon Hall Hampstead the familys London residence and summers at their home in Fowey Cornwall where they also lived during the war years. Du Maurier married Major Frederick Boy Browning in 1932. They had three children Biographers have noted that du Mauriers marriage was at times somewhat chilly and that she could be aloof and distant to her children especially the girls when immersed in her writing. Her husband died in 1965 and soon after Daphne moved to Kilmarth near Par Cornwall which became the setting for The House on the Strand. Du Maurier has often been painted as a frostily private recluse who rarely mixed in society or gave interviews. An exception to this came after the release of the film A Bridge Too Far in which her late husband was portrayed in a less-than-flattering light. Incensed she wrote to the national newspapers decrying what she considered unforgivable treatment. Once out of the public spotlight however many remembered her as a warm and immensely funny person who was a welcoming hostess to guests at Menabilly the house that she had leased for many years from the Rashleigh family in Cornwall. She appeared as a castaway in the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs broadcast on 3 September 1977. Her chosen book was The Collected Works of Jane Austen and her luxury was whiskey and ginger ale. Du Maurier was an early member of Mebyon Kernow a Cornish nationalist party. She was known as Daphne du Maurier from 1907 to 1932 when she married Frederick Browning. Still writing as Daphne du Maurier during her marriage she was also known as Lady Browning after her husband was knighted in 1946. When she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969 she was titled Dame Daphne du Maurier Lady Browning DBE but she never used the title. According to her biographer Margaret Forster she told no one about the honour so that even her children learned of it only from the newspapers. She thought of pleading illness for the investiture until her children insisted it would be a great day for the older grandchildren. So she went through with it though she slipped out quietly afterwards to avoid the attention of the press. After du Mauriers death in 1989 some writers speculated about her alleged relationships with a number of women including the actress Gertrude Lawrence and Ellen Doubleday the wife of her U.S. publisher Nelson Doubleday. Du Maurier stated in her memoirs that her father had wanted a son; being a tomboy she wished to have been born a boy. The Daphne du Maurier Companion edited by Helen Taylor includes Taylors claims that du Maurier confessed to her in 1965 that she had had an incestuous relationship with her father and that he had been a violent alcoholic. In correspondence that her family released to biographer Margaret Forster du Maurier explained to a trusted few people her own unique slant on her sexuality her personality comprised two distinct people the loving wife and mother ; and the lover hidden from virtually everyone and the power behind her artistic creativity. According to Forsters biography du Maurier believed the male energy propelled her writing. Forster wrote that du Mauriers denial of her bisexuality unveiled a homophobic fear of her true nature. The children of both du Maurier and Lawrence have objected strongly to the stories about their mothers alleged intimate relationship. Two years after Lawrence died a biography of her authored by her widower Richard Aldrich went into detail about a friendship between her and du Maurier that had begun in 1948 when Lawrence had accepted the lead role in du Mauriers new play September Tide. Aldrich said that Lawrence had toured Britain in the play in 1948 and continued with it in Londons West End theatre district through 1949 and that later du Maurier visited them at their home in the United States. Aldrich made no mention of a possible same-sex relationship. Du Maurier died from heart failure in her sleep on 19 April 1989 aged 81 at her home in Par Cornwall which had been the setting for many of her books. Her body was cremated in private and without a memorial service and her ashes scattered off the cliffs around Kilmarth and Menabilly Cornwall. Her family connections helped her establish her literary career and she published some of her early work in her great uncle Comyns Beaumonts Bystander magazine. Her first novel The Loving Spirit was published in 1931. The novel Rebecca was du Mauriers most successful work. It was an immediate hit selling nearly 3 million copies between 1938 and 1965. The novel has never gone out of print. In the United States du Maurier won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1938 voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. In the UK it was listed at number 14 of the nations best-loved novels on the BBCs 2003 survey The Big Read. Other significant works include Jamaica Inn Frenchmans Creek Hungry Hill My Cousin Rachel The Scapegoat The House on the Strand and The Kings General. The last is set in Cornwall during the English Civil War and is written from the Royalist perspective.  Du Maurier was often categorised as a romantic novelist a term that she deplored given that her novels rarely have a happy ending and often have sinister overtones and shadows of the paranormal. In this light she has more in common with the sensation novels of Wilkie Collins and others which she admired. The critic Kate Kellaway wrote Du Maurier was mistress of calculated irresolution. She did not want to put her readers minds at rest. She wanted her riddles to persist. She wanted the novels to continue to haunt us beyond their endings. Du Mauriers novel Mary Anne is a fictionalised account of her great-great-grandmother Mary Anne Clarke née Thompson who from 1803 to 1808 was mistress of Frederick Augustus Duke of York and Albany . He was the Grand Old Duke of York of the nursery rhyme a son of King George III and brother of King George IV and King William IV. The central character of her last novel Rule Britannia is an aging actress thought to be based on Gladys Cooper . Du Mauriers short stories are darker The Birds Dont Look Now The Apple Tree and The Blue Lenses are finely crafted tales of terror that shocked and surprised her audience in equal measure. As her biographer Margaret Forster wrote She satisfied all the questionable criteria of popular fiction and yet satisfied too the exacting requirements of real literature. The discovery in 2011 of a collection of du Mauriers forgotten short stories written when the author was 21 provides some insight into her mature style. One of them The Doll concerns a young womans obsession with a mechanical male sex doll; it has been deemed by du Mauriers son Kit Browning to be quite ahead of its time. She also wrote non-fiction including several biographies such as Gerald her fathers biography. The Glass-Blowers traces her French Huguenot ancestry and vividly depicts the French Revolution. The du Mauriers traces the familys move from France to England in the 19th century. The House on the Strand combines elements of mental time-travel a tragic love affair in 14th-century Cornwall and the dangers of using mind-altering drugs. Her final book Rule Britannia was not well-received her biographer Margaret Forster considering it to be the authors poorest novel. Rebecca has been adapted for both stage and screen several times most notably by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1940 film Rebecca. Several of du Mauriers other novels have also been adapted for the screen including Jamaica Inn Frenchmans Creek Hungry Hill and My Cousin Rachel in both 1952 and 2017. The Hitchcock film The Birds is based on a treatment of the short story of that name as is the film Dont Look Now . Of the films du Maurier often complained that the only ones she liked were Hitchcocks Rebecca and Nicolas Roegs Dont Look Now. Hitchcocks treatment of Jamaica Inn was disavowed by both director and author due to a complete re-write of the ending to accommodate the ego of its star Charles Laughton. Du Maurier also felt that Olivia de Havilland was wrongly cast as the anti-heroine of My Cousin Rachel .Frenchmans Creek fared better in a lavish Technicolor version released in 1944. Du Maurier later regretted her choice of Alec Guinness as the lead in the film of The Scapegoat which she partly financed. Du Maurier wrote three plays. Her first was an adaptation of her novel Rebecca which opened at the Queens Theatre in London on 5 March 1940 in a production by George Devine starring Celia Johnson and Owen Nares as the De Winters and Margaret Rutherford as Mrs. Danvers. After 181 performances the production transferred to the Strand Theatre with Jill Furse taking over as the second Mrs. De Winter and Mary Merrall as Mrs. Danvers with a further run of 176 performances. In 1943 she wrote the autobiographically inspired drama The Years Between about the unexpected return of a senior officer thought killed in action who finds that his wife has taken his seat as Member of Parliament and has started a romantic relationship with a local farmer. It was first staged at the Manchester Opera House in 1944 and then transferred to London opening at Wyndhams Theatre on 10 January 1945 starring Nora Swinburne and Clive Brook. The production directed by Irene Hentschel became a long-running hit completing 617 performances. It was revived by Caroline Smith at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond upon Thames on 5 September 2007 starring Karen Ascoe and Mark Tandy. Her third play September Tide portrays a middle-aged woman whose bohemian artist son-in-law falls in love with her. Again directed by Irene Hentschel it opened at the Aldwych Theatre on 15 December 1948 with Gertrude Lawrence as Stella. It closed in August 1949 after 267 performances. Shortly after Rebecca was published in Brazil critic Álvaro Lins and other readers pointed out many resemblances to the 1934 book A Sucessora by Brazilian writer Carolina Nabuco. According to Nabuco and her editor not only the main plot but also situations and entire dialogues had been copied. Du Maurier denied having copied Nabucos book as did her publisher pointing out that the plot elements said to have been plagiarised were quite common. When the film version of Rebecca came to Brazil the producers lawyer sought out my lawyer to ask him that I sign a document admitting the possibility of there having been a mere coincidence. I would be compensated with a quantity described as of considerable value. I did not consent naturally. Author Frank Baker believed that du Maurier had plagiarised his novel The Birds in her short story The Birds . Du Maurier had been working as a reader for Bakers publisher Peter Llewelyn Davies at the time he submitted the book. When Hitchcocks The Birds was released in 1963 based on du Mauriers story Baker considered but was advised against pursuing costly litigation against Universal Studios.
T. S. Eliot,Thomas Stearns Eliot OM was a poet essayist publisher playwright literary critic and editor. Considered one of the 20th centurys major poets he is a central figure in English-language Modernist poetry. Through his trials in language writing style and verse structure he reinvigorated English poetry. He also dismantled outdated beliefs and established new ones through a collection of critical essays. Born in St. Louis Missouri to a prominent Boston Brahmin family he moved to England in 1914 at the age of 25 and went on to settle work and marry there. He became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39 and renounced his American citizenship. Eliot first attracted widespread attention for his poem The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock from 1914 to 1915 which at the time of its publication was considered outlandish. It was followed by The Waste Land The Hollow Men Ash Wednesday and Four Quartets . He was also known for seven plays particularly Murder in the Cathedral and The Cocktail Party . He was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Literature for his outstanding pioneer contribution to present-day poetry. The Eliots were a Boston Brahmin family with roots in England and New England. Eliots paternal grandfather William Greenleaf Eliot had moved to St. Louis Missouri to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father Henry Ware Eliot was a successful businessman president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother Charlotte Champe Stearns who wrote poetry was a social worker which was a new profession in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather Thomas Stearns. Eliots childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double inguinal hernia he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read the young boy immediately became obsessed with books favouring tales of savage life the Wild West or Mark Twains thrill-seeking Tom Sawyer. In his memoir about Eliot his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living. Secondly Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed ones childhood beside the big river which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here rather than in Boston or New York or London. From 1898 to 1905 Eliot attended Smith Academy the boys college preparatory division of Washington University where his studies included Latin Ancient Greek French and German. He began to write poetry when he was 14 under the influence of Edward Fitzgeralds translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. He said the results were gloomy and despairing and he destroyed them. His first published poem A Fable For Feasters was written as a school exercise and was published in the Smith Academy Record in February 1905. Also published there in April 1905 was his oldest surviving poem in manuscript an untitled lyric later revised and reprinted as Song in The Harvard Advocate Harvard Universitys student literary magazine. He published three short stories in 1905 Birds of Prey A Tale of a Whale and The Man Who Was King. The last mentioned story reflected his exploration of the Igorot Village while visiting the 1904 Worlds Fair of St. Louis. His interest in indigenous peoples thus predated his anthropological studies at Harvard. Eliot lived in St. Louis Missouri for the first 16 years of his life at the house on Locust Street where he was born. After going away to school in 1905 he returned to St. Louis only for vacations and visits. Despite moving away from the city Eliot wrote to a friend that Missouri and the Mississippi have made a deeper impression on me than any other part of the world. Following graduation from Smith Academy Eliot attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts for a preparatory year where he met Scofield Thayer who later published The Waste Land. He studied at Harvard College from 1906 to 1909 earning a Bachelor of Arts in an elective program similar to comparative literature in 1909 and a Master of Arts in English literature the following year. Because of his year at Milton Academy Eliot was allowed to earn his Bachelor of Arts after three years instead of the usual four.Frank Kermode writes that the most important moment of Eliots undergraduate career was in 1908 when he discovered Arthur Symonss The Symbolist Movement in Literature. This introduced him to Jules Laforgue Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. Without Verlaine Eliot wrote he might never have heard of Tristan Corbière and his book Les amours jaunes a work that affected the course of Eliots life. The Harvard Advocate published some of his poems and he became lifelong friends with Conrad Aiken the American writer and critic. After working as a philosophy assistant at Harvard from 1909 to 1910 Eliot moved to Paris where from 1910 to 1911 he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne. He attended lectures by Henri Bergson and read poetry with Henri Alban-Fournier. From 1911 to 1914 he was back at Harvard studying Indian philosophy and Sanskrit. Whilst a member of the Harvard Graduate School Eliot met and fell in love with Emily Hale. Eliot was awarded a scholarship to Merton College Oxford in 1914. He first visited Marburg Germany where he planned to take a summer programme but when the First World War broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the Junior Common Room proposed a motion that this society abhors the Americanization of Oxford. It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture. Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken on New Years Eve 1914 I hate university towns and university people who are the same everywhere with pregnant wives sprawling children many books and hideous pictures on the walls It was Pound who helped most introducing him everywhere. In the end Eliot did not settle at Merton and left after a year. In 1915 he taught English at Birkbeck University of London. In 1916 he completed a doctoral dissertation for Harvard on Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley but he failed to return for the viva voce exam. Before leaving the US Eliot had told Emily Hale that he was in love with her. He exchanged letters with her from Oxford during 1914 and 1915 but they did not meet again until 1927. In a letter to Aiken late in December 1914 Eliot aged 26 wrote I am very dependent upon women . Less than four months later Thayer introduced Eliot to Vivienne Haigh-Wood a Cambridge governess. They were married at Hampstead Register Office on 26 June 1915. After a short visit alone to his family in the United States Eliot returned to London and took several teaching jobs such as lecturing at Birkbeck College University of London. The philosopher Bertrand Russell took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat. Some scholars have suggested that she and Russell had an affair but the allegations were never confirmed. The marriage seems to have been markedly unhappy in part because of Viviennes health problems. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound she covers an extensive list of her symptoms which included a habitually high temperature fatigue insomnia migraines and colitis. This coupled with apparent mental instability meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health. As time went on he became increasingly detached from her.According to witnesses both Eliots were frequent complainers of illness physical and mental while Eliot would drink excessively and Vivienne is said to have developed a liking for opium and ether drugs prescribed for medical issues. It is claimed that the couples wearying behaviour caused some visitors to vow never to spend another evening in the company of both together.The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Viviennes brother Maurice had her committed to a mental hospital against her will where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. When told via a phone call from the asylum that Vivienne had died unexpectedly during the night Eliot is said to have buried his face in his hands and cried out Oh God oh God. Their relationship became the subject of a 1984 play Tom Viv which in 1994 was adapted as a film of the same name. In a private paper written in his sixties Eliot confessed I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her the marriage brought no happiness. To me it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land. After leaving Merton Eliot worked as a schoolteacher most notably at Highgate School in London where he taught French and Latin his students included John Betjeman. He subsequently taught at the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. To earn extra money he wrote book reviews and lectured at evening extension courses at University College London and Oxford. In 1917 he took a position at Lloyds Bank in London working on foreign accounts. On a trip to Paris in August 1920 with the artist Wyndham Lewis he met the writer James Joyce. Eliot said he found Joyce arrogant and Joyce doubted Eliots ability as a poet at the time but the two writers soon became friends with Eliot visiting Joyce whenever he was in Paris. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis also maintained a close friendship leading to Lewiss later making his well-known portrait painting of Eliot in 1938. Charles Whibley recommended T.S. Eliot to Geoffrey Faber. In 1925 Eliot left Lloyds to become a director in the publishing firm Faber and Gwyer where he remained for the rest of his career. At Faber and Faber he was responsible for publishing distinguished English poets including W. H. Auden Stephen Spender Charles Madge and Ted Hughes. On 29 June 1927 Eliot converted from Unitarianism to Anglicanism and in November that year he took British citizenship thereby renouncing his United States citizenship in the event he had not officially done so previously.He became a churchwarden of his parish church St Stephens Gloucester Road London and a life member of the Society of King Charles the Martyr. He specifically identified as Anglo-Catholic proclaiming himself classicist in literature royalist in politics and anglo-catholic in religion. About 30 years later Eliot commented on his religious views that he combined a Catholic cast of mind a Calvinist heritage and a Puritanical temperament. He also had wider spiritual interests commenting that I see the path of progress for modern man in his occupation with his own self with his inner being and citing Goethe and Rudolf Steiner as exemplars of such a direction. One of Eliots biographers Peter Ackroyd commented that the purposes of were two-fold. One the Church of England offered Eliot some hope for himself and I think Eliot needed some resting place. But secondly it attached Eliot to the English community and English culture. By 1932 Eliot had been contemplating a separation from his wife for some time. When Harvard offered him the Charles Eliot Norton professorship for the 19321933 academic year he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return he arranged for a formal separation from her avoiding all but one meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital in Woodberry Down Manor House London in 1938 and remained there until she died. Although Eliot was still legally her husband he never visited her. From 1933 to 1946 Eliot had a close emotional relationship with Emily Hale. Eliot later destroyed Hales letters to him but Hale donated Eliots to Princeton University Library where they were sealed following Eliots and Hales wishes for 50 years after both had died until 2020. When Eliot heard of the donation he deposited his own account of their relationship with Harvard University to be opened whenever the Princeton letters were. From 1938 to 1957 Eliots public companion was Mary Trevelyan of London University who wanted to marry him and left a detailed memoir. From 1946 to 1957 Eliot shared a flat at 19 Carlyle Mansions Chelsea with his friend John Davy Hayward who collected and managed Eliots papers styling himself Keeper of the Eliot Archive. Hayward also collected Eliots pre-Prufrock verse commercially published after Eliots death as Poems Written in Early Youth. When Eliot and Hayward separated their household in 1957 Hayward retained his collection of Eliots papers which he bequeathed to Kings College Cambridge in 1965. On 10 January 1957 at the age of 68 Eliot married Esmé Valerie Fletcher who was 30. In contrast to his first marriage Eliot knew Fletcher well as she had been his secretary at Faber and Faber since August 1949. They kept their wedding secret; the ceremony was held in St. Barnabas Church Kensington London at 615am with virtually no one in attendance other than his wifes parents. Eliot had no children with either of his wives. In the early 1960s by then in failing health Eliot worked as an editor for the Wesleyan University Press seeking new poets in Europe for publication. After Eliots death Valerie dedicated her time to preserving his legacy by editing and annotating The Letters of T. S. Eliot and a facsimile of the draft of The Waste Land. Valerie Eliot died on 9 November 2012 at her home in London. Eliot died of emphysema at his home in Kensington in London on 4 January 1965 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. In accordance with his wishes his ashes were taken to St Michael and All Angels Church East Coker the village in Somerset from which his Eliot ancestors had emigrated to America. A wall plaque in the church commemorates him with a quotation from his poem East Coker In my beginning is my end. In my end is my beginning. In 1967 on the second anniversary of his death Eliot was commemorated by the placement of a large stone in the floor of Poets Corner in Londons Westminster Abbey. The stone cut by designer Reynolds Stone is inscribed with his life dates his Order of Merit and a quotation from his poem Little Gidding the communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living. In 1986 a blue plaque was placed on the apartment block - No. 3 Kensington Court Gardens - where he lived and died. For a poet of his stature Eliot produced relatively few poems. He was aware of this even early in his career; he wrote to J. H. Woods one of his former Harvard professors My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind so that each should be an event. Typically Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was Prufrock and Other Observations . In 1920 he published more poems in Ara Vos Prec and Poems 1920 . These had the same poems except that Ode in the British edition was replaced with Hysteria in the American edition. In 1925 he collected The Waste Land and the poems in Prufrock and Poems into one volume and added The Hollow Men to form Poems 19091925. From then on he updated this work as Collected Poems. Exceptions are Old Possums Book of Practical Cats a collection of light verse; Poems Written in Early Youth posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in The Harvard Advocate and Inventions of the March Hare Poems 19091917 material Eliot never intended to have published which appeared posthumously in 1996. During an interview in 1959 Eliot said of his nationality and its role in his work Id say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That Im sure of. ... It wouldnt be what it is and I imagine it wouldnt be so good; putting it as modestly as I can it wouldnt be what it is if Id been born in England and it wouldnt be what it is if Id stayed in America. Its a combination of things. But in its sources in its emotional springs it comes from America. Cleo McNelly Kearns notes in her biography that Eliot was deeply influenced by Indic traditions notably the Upanishads. From the Sanskrit ending of The Waste Land to the What Krishna meant section of Four Quartets shows how much Indic religions and more specifically Hinduism made up his philosophical basic for his thought process. It must also be acknowledged as Chinmoy Guha showed in his book Where the Dreams Cross T S Eliot and French Poetry that he was deeply influenced by French poets from Baudelaire to Paul Valéry. He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French. . In 1915 Ezra Pound overseas editor of Poetry magazine recommended to Harriet Monroe the magazines founder that she should publish The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only twenty-two. Its now-famous opening lines comparing the evening sky to a patient etherised upon a table were considered shocking and offensive especially at a time when Georgian Poetry was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century Romantic Poets. The poems structure was heavily influenced by Eliots extensive reading of Dante and refers to a number of literary works including Hamlet and those of the French Symbolists. Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917. The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone even to himself. They certainly have no relation to poetry. In October 1922 Eliot published The Waste Land in The Criterion. Eliots dedication to il miglior fabbro refers to Ezra Pounds significant hand in editing and reshaping the poem from a longer Eliot manuscript to the shortened version that appears in publication. It was composed during a period of personal difficulty for Eliothis marriage was failing and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. Before the poems publication as a book in December 1922 Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922 he wrote to Richard Aldington saying As for The Waste Land that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view Eliot commented in 1931 When I wrote a poem called The Waste Land some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed the disillusion of a generation which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned but that did not form part of my intention. The poem is known for its obscure natureits slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker location and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons that the poem has become a touchstone of modern literature a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year James Joyces Ulysses. Among its best-known phrases are April is the cruellest month I will show you fear in a handful of dust and Shantih shantih shantihthe Sanskrit mantra which ends the poem. Allen Tate perceived a shift in Eliots method writing The mythologies disappear altogether in The Hollow Men. This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to Dante as anything else in Eliots early work to say little of the modern English mythologythe Old Guy Fawkes of the Gunpowder Plotor the colonial and agrarian mythos of Joseph Conrad and James George Frazer which at least for reasons of textual history echo in The Waste Land. The continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity that is so characteristic of his mythical method remained in fine form. The Hollow Men contains some of Eliots most famous lines notably its conclusion .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhidden;margin1em 0;padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5em;text-alignleft;padding-left1.6em;margin-top0 This is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper. Many critics were particularly enthusiastic about Ash-Wednesday. Edwin Muir maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote and perhaps the most perfect though it was not well received by everyone. The poems groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular literati. In 1939 Eliot published a book of light verse Old Possums Book of Practical Cats. The first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954 the composer Alan Rawsthorne set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled Practical Cats. After Eliots death the book was the basis of the musical Cats by Andrew Lloyd Webber first produced in Londons West End in 1981 and opening on Broadway the following year. Eliot regarded Four Quartets as his masterpiece and it is the work that most of all led him to being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. It consists of four long poems each first published separately Burnt Norton East Coker The Dry Salvages and Little Gidding . Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respecttheological historical physicaland its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four classical elements respectively air earth water and fire. The Four Quartets draws upon Christian theology art symbolism and language of such figures as Dante and mystics St. John of the Cross and Julian of Norwich. With the important exception of Four Quartets Eliot directed much of his creative energies after Ash Wednesday to writing plays in verse mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster Thomas Middleton William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said Every poet would like I fancy to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it. After The Waste Land he wrote that he was now feeling toward a new form and style. One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse using some of the rhythms of early jazz. The play featured Sweeney a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes titled Fragment of a Prologue and Fragment of an Agon were published together in 1932 as Sweeney Agonistes. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play it is sometimes performed as one. A pageant play by Eliot called The Rock was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the Diocese of London. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.George Bell the Bishop of Chichester had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer E. Martin Browne for the production of The Rock and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the Canterbury Festival in 1935. This one Murder in the Cathedral concerning the death of the martyr Thomas Becket was more under Eliots control. Eliot biographer Peter Ackroyd comments that for Murder in the Cathedral and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility. After this he worked on more commercial plays for more general audiences The Family Reunion The Cocktail Party The Confidential Clerk and The Elder Statesman . The Broadway production in New York of The Cocktail Party received the 1950 Tony Award for Best Play. Eliot wrote The Cocktail Party while he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study. Regarding his method of playwriting Eliot explained If I set out to write a play I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind. Eliot also made significant contributions to the field of literary criticism and strongly influenced the school of New Criticism. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a by-product of his private poetry-workshop. But the critic William Empson once said I do not know for certain how much of my own mind invented let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence perhaps not unlike the east wind. In his critical essay Tradition and the Individual Talent Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum but in the context of previous pieces of art. In a peculiar sense ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past. This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artists previous works a simultaneous order of works . Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works especially on his long-poem The Waste Land. Also important to New Criticism was the ideaas articulated in Eliots essay Hamlet and His Problemsof an objective correlative which posits a connection among the words of the text and events states of mind and experiences. This notion concedes that a poem means what it says but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers differentbut perhaps corollaryinterpretations of a work. More generally New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his classical ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics especially Shelley; his proposition that good poems constitute not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion; and his insistence that poets... at present must be difficult. Eliots essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the metaphysical poets. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual while at the same time infusing this portrayal within Eliots viewwit and uniqueness. Eliots essay The Metaphysical Poets along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry introduced his now well-known definition of unified sensibility which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term metaphysical. His 1922 poem The Waste Land also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write programmatic criticism that is a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance historical scholarship. Viewed from Eliots critical lens The Waste Land likely shows his personal despair about World War I rather than an objective historical understanding of it. Late in his career Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing in essays such as Poetry and Drama Hamlet and his Problems and The Possibility of a Poetic Drama focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse. The writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliots early poems like The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock Portrait of a Lady La Figlia Che Piange Preludes and Rhapsody on a Windy Night had Aiken for example marveled at how sharp and complete and sui generis the whole thing was from the outset. The wholeness is there from the very beginning. The initial critical response to Eliots The Waste Land was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopationand like 1920s jazz essentially iconoclastic. Some critics like Edmund Wilson Conrad Aiken and Gilbert Seldes thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson being one of the critics who praised Eliot called him one of our only authentic poets. Wilson also pointed out some of Eliots weaknesses as a poet. In regard to The Waste Land Wilson admits its flaws but concluded I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse. Charles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot calling his poems incomprehensible. And the writers of Time magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like The Waste Land.John Crowe Ransom wrote negative criticisms of Eliots work but also had positive things to say. For instance though Ransom negatively criticised The Waste Land for its extreme disconnection Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliots work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet. Addressing some of the common criticisms directed against The Waste Land at the time Gilbert Seldes stated It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... indicates how each thing falls into place. As Eliots conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority obvious in Four Quartets and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliots occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation. Literary scholars such as Harold Bloom and Stephen Greenblatt acknowledge Eliots poetry as central to the literary English canon. For instance the editors of The Norton Anthology of English Literature write There is no disagreement on poetic cunning his fine craftsmanship his original accent his historical and representative importance as the poet of the modern symbolist-Metaphysical tradition. The depiction of Jews in some of Eliots poems has led several critics to accuse him of antisemitism most forcefully in Anthony Julius book T. S. Eliot Anti-Semitism and Literary Form . In Gerontion Eliot writes in the voice of the poems elderly narrator And the jew squats on the window sill the owner Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp. Another example appears in the poem Burbank with a Baedeker Bleistein with a Cigar in which Eliot wrote The rats are underneath the piles. The jew is underneath the lot. Money in furs. Julius writes The anti-Semitism is unmistakable. It reaches out like a clear signal to the reader. Julius viewpoint has been supported by Harold BloomChristopher RicksGeorge SteinerTom Paulin and James Fenton. In lectures delivered at the University of Virginia in 1933 Eliot wrote of societal tradition and coherence What is still more important is unity of religious background and reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable. Eliot never re-published this booklecture. In his 1934 pageant play The Rock Eliot distances himself from Fascist movements of the 1930s by caricaturing Oswald Mosleys Blackshirts who firmly refuse To descend to palaver with anthropoid Jews. The new evangels of totalitarianism are presented as antithetic to the spirit of Christianity. In In Defence of T. S. Eliot and T. S. Eliot Craig Raine sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Paul Dean was not convinced by Raines argument. Nevertheless Dean concluded Ultimately as both Raine and to do him justice Julius insist however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person as we all are in our several ways his greatness as a poet remains. Critic Terry Eagleton also questioned the entire basis for Raines book writing Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children Eliots well-earned reputation is established beyond all doubt and making him out to be as unflawed as the Archangel Gabriel does him no favours. Eliot influenced many poets novelists and songwriters including Seán Ó Ríordáin Máirtín Ó Díreáin Virginia Woolf Ezra Pound Bob Dylan Hart Crane William Gaddis Allen Tate Andrew Lloyd Webber Trevor Nunn Ted Hughes Geoffrey Hill Seamus Heaney F. Scott Fitzgerald Russell KirkGeorge Seferis and James Joyce. T. S. Eliot was a strong influence on 20th-century Caribbean poetry written in English including the epic Omeros by Nobel laureate Derek Walcott and Islands by Barbadian Kamau Brathwaite.

George Orwell,Eric Arthur Blair better known by his pen name George Orwell was an English novelist essayist journalist and critic. His work is characterised by lucid prose social criticism opposition to totalitarianism and support of democratic socialism. Orwell produced literary criticism poetry fiction and polemical journalism. He is known for the allegorical novella Animal Farm and the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four . His non-fiction works including The Road to Wigan Pier documenting his experience of working-class life in the industrial north of England and Homage to Catalonia an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War are as critically respected as his essays on politics literature language and culture. Born in India Blair was raised and educated in England from when he was one year old. After school he became an Imperial policeman in Burma before returning to Suffolk England where he began his writing career as George Orwella name inspired by a favourite location the River Orwell. He made a living from occasional pieces of journalism and also worked as a teacher or bookseller while living in London. From the late 1920s to the early 1930s his success as a writer grew and his first books were published. He was wounded fighting in the Spanish Civil War leading to his first period of ill health on return to England. During the Second World War he worked as a journalist and between 1941 and 1943 for the BBC. The 1945 publication of Animal Farm led to fame during his lifetime. During the final years of his life he worked on Nineteen Eighty-Four and moved between Jura in Scotland and London. It was published in June 1949 less than a year before his death. Orwells work remains influential in popular culture and in political culture and the adjective Orwelliandescribing totalitarian and authoritarian social practicesis part of the English language like many of his neologisms such as Big Brother Thought Police Room 101 Newspeak memory hole doublethink and thoughtcrime. In 2008 The Times ranked George Orwell second among The 50 greatest British writers since 1945. Eric Arthur Blair was born on 25 June 1903 in Motihari Bengal British India into what he described as a lower-upper-middle class family. His great-great-grandfather Charles Blair was a wealthy slaveowning country gentleman and absentee owner of two Jamaican plantations; hailing from Dorset he married Lady Mary Fane daughter of the 8th Earl of Westmorland. His grandfather Thomas Richard Arthur Blair was an Anglican clergyman. Orwells father was Richard Walmesley Blair who worked as a Sub-Deputy Opium Agent in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service overseeing the production and storage of opium for sale to China. His mother Ida Mabel Blair grew up in Moulmein Burma where her French father was involved in speculative ventures. Eric had two sisters Marjorie five years older; and Avril five years younger. When Eric was one year old his mother took him and Marjorie to England. In 2014 restoration work began on Orwells birthplace and ancestral house in Motihari. In 1904 Ida Blair settled with her children at Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. Eric was brought up in the company of his mother and sisters and apart from a brief visit in mid-1907 he did not see his father until 1912. Aged five Eric was sent as a day-boy to a convent school in Henley-on-Thames which Marjorie also attended. It was a Roman Catholic convent run by French Ursuline nuns. His mother wanted him to have a public school education but his family could not afford the fees. Through the social connections of Ida Blairs brother Charles Limouzin Blair gained a scholarship to St Cyprians School Eastbourne East Sussex. Arriving in September 1911 he boarded at the school for the next five years returning home only for school holidays. Although he knew nothing of the reduced fees he soon recognised that he was from a poorer home. Blair hated the school and many years later wrote an essay Such Such Were the Joys published posthumously based on his time there. At St Cyprians Blair first met Cyril Connolly who became a writer and who as the editor of Horizon published several of Orwells essays. Before the First World War the family moved 2 miles south to Shiplake Oxfordshire where Eric became friendly with the Buddicom family especially their daughter Jacintha. When they first met he was standing on his head in a field. Asked why he said You are noticed more if you stand on your head than if you are right way up. Jacintha and Eric read and wrote poetry and dreamed of becoming famous writers. He said that he might write a book in the style of H. G. Wellss A Modern Utopia. During this period he also enjoyed shooting fishing and birdwatching with Jacinthas brother and sister. While at St Cyprians Blair wrote two poems that were published in the Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard. He came second to Connolly in the Harrow History Prize had his work praised by the schools external examiner and earned scholarships to Wellington and Eton. But inclusion on the Eton scholarship roll did not guarantee a place and none was immediately available for Blair. He chose to stay at St Cyprians until December 1916 in case a place at Eton became available. In January Blair took up the place at Wellington where he spent the Spring term. In May 1917 a place became available as a Kings Scholar at Eton. At this time the family lived at Mall Chambers Notting Hill Gate. Blair remained at Eton until December 1921 when he left midway between his 18th and 19th birthdays. Wellington was beastly Blair told Jacintha but he said he was interested and happy at Eton. His principal tutor was A. S. F. Gow Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge who also gave him advice later in his career. Blair was briefly taught French by Aldous Huxley. Steven Runciman who was at Eton with Blair noted that he and his contemporaries appreciated Huxleys linguistic flair. Cyril Connolly followed Blair to Eton but because they were in separate years they did not associate with each other. Blairs academic performance reports suggest that he neglected his studies but during his time at Eton he worked with Roger Mynors to produce a college magazine The Election Times joined in the production of other publicationsCollege Days and Bubble and Squeakand participated in the Eton Wall Game. His parents could not afford to send him to a university without another scholarship and they concluded from his poor results that he would not be able to win one. Runciman noted that he had a romantic idea about the East and the family decided that Blair should join the Imperial Police the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance examination. In December 1921 he left Eton and travelled to join his retired father mother and younger sister Avril who that month had moved to 40 Stradbroke Road Southwold Suffolk the first of their four homes in the town. Blair was enrolled at a crammer there called Craighurst and brushed up on his Classics English and History. He passed the entrance exam coming seventh out of the 26 candidates who exceeded the pass mark. Blairs maternal grandmother lived at Moulmein so he chose a posting in Burma then still a province of British India. In October 1922 he sailed on board SS Herefordshire via the Suez Canal and Ceylon to join the Indian Imperial Police in Burma. A month later he arrived at Rangoon and travelled to the police training school in Mandalay. He was appointed an Assistant District Superintendent on 29 November 1922 with effect from 27 November and at the pay of Rs. 525 per month. After a short posting at Maymyo Burmas principal hill station he was posted to the frontier outpost of Myaungmya in the Irrawaddy Delta at the beginning of 1924. Working as an imperial police officer gave him considerable responsibility while most of his contemporaries were still at university in England. When he was posted farther east in the Delta to Twante as a sub-divisional officer he was responsible for the security of some 200000 people. At the end of 1924 he was posted to Syriam closer to Rangoon. Syriam had the refinery of the Burmah Oil Company the surrounding land a barren waste all vegetation killed off by the fumes of sulphur dioxide pouring out day and night from the stacks of the refinery. But the town was near Rangoon a cosmopolitan seaport and Blair went into the city as often as he could to browse in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring routine of police life. In September 1925 he went to Insein the home of Insein Prison the second largest prison in Burma. In Insein he had long talks on every conceivable subject with Elisa Maria Langford-Rae . She noted his sense of utter fairness in minutest details. By this time Blair had completed his training and was receiving a monthly salary of Rs. 740 including allowances. Blair recalled he faced hostility from the Burmese in the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance got badly on my nerves. He recalled that I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make my job impossible. In Burma Blair acquired a reputation as an outsider. He spent much of his time alone reading or pursuing non-pukka activities such as attending the churches of the Karen ethnic group. A colleague Roger Beadon recalled that Blair was fast to learn the language and that before he left Burma was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in very high-flown Burmese. Blair made changes to his appearance in Burma that remained for the rest of his life including adopting a pencil moustache. Emma Larkin writes in the introduction to Burmese Days While in Burma he acquired a moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there. also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like thisthey are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites. In April 1926 he moved to Moulmein where his maternal grandmother lived. At the end of that year he was assigned to Katha in Upper Burma where he contracted dengue fever in 1927. Entitled to a leave in England that year he was allowed to return in July due to his illness. While on leave in England and on holiday with his family in Cornwall in September 1927 he reappraised his life. Deciding against returning to Burma he resigned from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer with effect from 12 March 1928 after five-and-a-half years of service. He drew on his experiences in the Burma police for the novel Burmese Days and the essays A Hanging and Shooting an Elephant . In England he settled back in the family home at Southwold renewing acquaintance with local friends and attending an Old Etonian dinner. He visited his old tutor Gow at Cambridge for advice on becoming a writer. In 1927 he moved to London.Ruth Pitter a family acquaintance helped him find lodgings and by the end of 1927 he had moved into rooms in Portobello Road; a blue plaque commemorates his residence there. Pitters involvement in the move would have lent it a reassuring respectability in Mrs. Blairs eyes. Pitter had a sympathetic interest in Blairs writing pointed out weaknesses in his poetry and advised him to write about what he knew. In fact he decided to write of certain aspects of the present that he set out to know and ventured into the East End of Londonthe first of the occasional sorties he would make to discover for himself the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit it. He had found a subject. These sorties explorations expeditions tours or immersions were made intermittently over a period of five years. In imitation of Jack London whose writing he admired Blair started to explore the poorer parts of London. On his first outing he set out to Limehouse Causeway spending his first night in a common lodging house possibly George Levys kip. For a while he went native in his own country dressing like a tramp adopting the name P.S. Burton and making no concessions to middle-class mores and expectations; he recorded his experiences of the low life for use in The Spike his first published essay in English and in the second half of his first book Down and Out in Paris and London . In early 1928 he moved to Paris. He lived in the rue du Pot de Fer a working class district in the 5th arrondissement. His aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and when necessary financial support. He began to write novels including an early version of Burmese Days but nothing else survives from that period. He was more successful as a journalist and published articles in Monde a politicalliterary journal edited by Henri Barbusse ; G. K.s Weekly where his first article to appear in England A Farthing Newspaper was printed on 29 December 1928; and Le Progrès Civique . Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in Le Progrès Civique discussing unemployment a day in the life of a tramp and the beggars of London respectively. In one or another of its destructive forms poverty was to become his obsessive subjectat the heart of almost everything he wrote until Homage to Catalonia. He fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the Hôpital Cochin in the 14th arrondissement a free hospital where medical students were trained. His experiences there were the basis of his essay How the Poor Die published in 1946. He chose not to identify the hospital and indeed was deliberately misleading about its location. Shortly afterwards he had all his money stolen from his lodging house. Whether through necessity or to collect material he undertook menial jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the rue de Rivoli which he later described in Down and Out in Paris and London. In August 1929 he sent a copy of The Spike to John Middleton Murrys New Adelphi magazine in London. The magazine was edited by Max Plowman and Sir Richard Rees and Plowman accepted the work for publication. In December 1929 after nearly two years in Paris Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents house in Southwold a coastal town in Suffolk which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town and his sister Avril was running a tea-house there. He became acquainted with many local people including Brenda Salkeld the clergymans daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at St Felix Girls School in the town. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends such as Dennis Collings whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life. In early 1930 he stayed briefly in Bramley Leeds with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin who was as unappreciative of Blair as when they knew each other as children. Blair was writing reviews for Adelphi and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers one of whom Richard Peters later became a distinguished academic. His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable outwardly eventless life at his parents house in Southwold writing; then in contrast there is Blair as Burton in search of experience in the kips and spikes in the East End on the road and in the hop fields of Kent. He went painting and bathing on the beach and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees where he could change for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for half a crown a day. Blair now contributed regularly to Adelphi with A Hanging appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued and like the protagonist of A Clergymans Daughter he followed the East End tradition of working in the Kent hop fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards he lodged in the Tooley Street kip but could not stand it for long and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street where he stayed until Christmas. Hop Picking by Eric Blair appeared in the October 1931 issue of New Statesman whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with Leonard Moore who became his literary agent in April 1932. At this time Jonathan Cape rejected A Scullions Diary the first version of Down and Out. On the advice of Richard Rees he offered it to Faber and Faber but their editorial director T. S. Eliot also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested so that he could experience Christmas in prison but after he was picked up and taken to Bethnal Green police station in the East End of London the authorities did not regard his drunk and disorderly behaviour as imprisonable and after two days in a cell he returned home to Southwold. In April 1932 Blair became a teacher at The Hawthorns High School a school for boys in Hayes West London. This was a small school offering private schooling for children of local tradesmen and shopkeepers and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen and one other master. While at the school he became friendly with the curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore and at the end of June 1932 Moore told Blair that Victor Gollancz was prepared to publish A Scullions Diary for a 40 advance through his recently founded publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd which was an outlet for radical and socialist works. At the end of the summer term in 1932 Blair returned to Southwold where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and his sister Avril spent the holidays making the house habitable while he also worked on Burmese Days. He was also spending time with Eleanor Jacques but her attachment to Dennis Collings remained an obstacle to his hopes of a more serious relationship. Down and Out in Paris and London was published by Victor Gollancz in London on 9 January 1933 and received favourable reviews with Cecil Day-Lewis complimenting Orwells clarity and good sense and The Times Literary Supplement comparing Orwells eccentric characters to the characters of Dickens.Down and Out was modestly successful and was next published by Harper Brothers in New York. In mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at Frays College in Uxbridge west London. This was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff. He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. He was taken to a cottage hospital in Uxbridge where for a time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in January 1934 he returned to Southwold to convalesce and supported by his parents never returned to teaching. He was disappointed when Gollancz turned down Burmese Days mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel but Harper were prepared to publish it in the United States. Meanwhile Blair started work on the novel A Clergymans Daughter drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold. Eleanor Jacques was now married and had gone to Singapore and Brenda Salkeld had left for Ireland so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwoldworking on the allotments walking alone and spending time with his father. Eventually in October after sending A Clergymans Daughter to Moore he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin. This job was as a part-time assistant in Booklovers Corner a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the Esperanto movement. The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions Pond Street. He was sharing the job with Jon Kimche who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel Keep the Aspidistra Flying . As well as the various guests of the Westropes he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the Adelphi writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the Independent Labour Party although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active. He was writing for the Adelphi and preparing A Clergymans Daughter and Burmese Days for publication. At the beginning of 1935 he had to move out of Warwick Mansions and Mabel Fierz found him a flat in Parliament Hill. A Clergymans Daughter was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 Blair met his future wife Eileen OShaughnessy when his landlady Rosalind Obermeyer who was studying for a masters degree in psychology at University College London invited some of her fellow students to a party. One of these students Elizaveta Fen a biographer and future translator of Chekhov recalled Blair and his friend Richard Rees draped at the fireplace looking she thought moth-eaten and prematurely aged. Around this time Blair had started to write reviews for The New English Weekly. In June Burmese Days was published and Cyril Connollys positive review in the New Statesman prompted Blair to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August he moved into a flat at 50 Lawford Road Kentish Town which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and Heppenstall even came to blows though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. Blair was now working on Keep the Aspidistra Flying and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the News Chronicle. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling to pay the rent on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936 when he stopped working at Booklovers Corner. In 1980 English Heritage honoured Orwell with a blue plaque at his Kentish Town residence. At this time Victor Gollancz suggested Orwell spend a short time investigating social conditions in economically depressed Northern England. Two years earlier J. B. Priestley had written about England north of the Trent sparking an interest in reportage. The Depression had also introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors Jack Hilton whom Orwell sought for advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging but suggested that he travel to Wigan rather than Rochdale for there are the colliers and theyre good stuff. On 31 January 1936 Orwell set out by public transport and on foot reaching Manchester via Coventry Stafford the Potteries and Macclesfield. Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed he had to stay in a common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent by Richard Rees. One of these the trade union official Frank Meade suggested Wigan where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings over a tripe shop. In Wigan he visited many homes to see how people lived took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned went down Bryn Hall coal mine and used the local public library to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines. During this time he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in Keep the Aspidistra Flying. He made a quick visit to Liverpool and during March stayed in south Yorkshire spending time in Sheffield and Barnsley. As well as visiting mines including Grimethorpe and observing social conditions he attended meetings of the Communist Party and of Oswald Mosley where he saw the tactics of the Blackshirts . He also made visits to his sister at Headingley during which he visited the Brontë Parsonage at Haworth where he was chiefly impressed by a pair of Charlotte Brontës cloth-topped boots very small with square toes and lacing up at the sides. Orwell needed somewhere he could concentrate on writing his book and once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie who was living at Wallington Hertfordshire in a very small 16th-century cottage called the Stores. Wallington was a tiny village 35 miles north of London and the cottage had almost no modern facilities. Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April 1936. He started work on The Road to Wigan Pier by the end of April but also spent hours working on the garden planting a rose garden which is still extant and revealing four years later that outside my work the thing I care most about is gardening especially vegetable gardening. He also tested the possibility of reopening the Stores as a village shop. Keep the Aspidistra Flying was published by Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August Orwell gave a talk at the Adelphi Summer School held at Langham entitled An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas; others who spoke at the school included John Strachey Max Plowman Karl Polanyi and Reinhold Niebuhr. The result of his journeys through the north was The Road to Wigan Pier published by Gollancz for the Left Book Club in 1937. The first half of the book documents his social investigations of Lancashire and Yorkshire including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his upbringing and the development of his political conscience which includes an argument for socialism . Gollancz feared the second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain. Orwells research for The Road to Wigan Pier led to him being placed under surveillance by the Special Branch from 1936 for 12 years until one year before the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell married Eileen OShaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards the political crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At the end of the year concerned by Francisco Francos military uprising Orwell decided to go to Spain to take part in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier on John Stracheys recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwells political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation in situ Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona. Orwell set out for Spain on about 23 December 1936 dining with Henry Miller in Paris on the way. Miller told Orwell that going to fight in the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was sheer stupidity and that the Englishmans ideas about combating Fascism defending democracy etc. etc. were all baloney. A few days later in Barcelona Orwell met John McNair of the Independent Labour Party Office who quoted him Ive come to fight against Fascism but if someone had asked him what he was fighting for I should have answered Common decency. Orwell stepped into a complex political situation in Catalonia. The Republican government was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims including the Workers Party of Marxist Unification the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia . Orwell was at first exasperated by this kaleidoscope of political parties and trade unions with their tiresome names. The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM. After a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he was sent to the relatively quiet Aragon Front under Georges Kopp. By January 1937 he was at Alcubierre 1500 feet above sea level in the depth of winter. There was very little military action and Orwell was shocked by the lack of munitions food and firewood as well as other extreme deprivations. With his Cadet Corps and police training Orwell was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British ILP Contingent about three weeks later Orwell and the other English militiaman Williams were sent with them to Monte Oscuro. The newly arrived ILP contingent included Bob Smillie Bob Edwards Stafford Cottman and Jack Branthwaite. The unit was then sent on to Huesca. Meanwhile back in England Eileen had been handling the issues relating to the publication of The Road to Wigan Pier before setting out for Spain herself leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNairs office and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband bringing him English tea chocolate and cigars. Orwell had to spend some days in hospital with a poisoned hand and had most of his possessions stolen by the staff. He returned to the front and saw some action in a night attack on the Nationalist trenches where he chased an enemy soldier with a bayonet and bombed an enemy rifle position. In April Orwell returned to Barcelona. Wanting to be sent to the Madrid front which meant he must join the International Column he approached a Communist friend attached to the Spanish Medical Aid and explained his case. Although he did not think much of the Communists Orwell was still ready to treat them as friends and allies. That would soon change. This was the time of the Barcelona May Days and Orwell was caught up in the factional fighting. He spent much of the time on a roof with a stack of novels but encountered Jon Kimche from his Hampstead days during the stay. The subsequent campaign of lies and distortion carried out by the Communist press in which the POUM was accused of collaborating with the fascists had a dramatic effect on Orwell. Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended he decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over he was approached by a Communist friend who asked if he still intended transferring to the International Brigades. Orwell expressed surprise that they should still want him because according to the Communist press he was a fascist. No one who was in Barcelona then or for months later will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear suspicion hatred censored newspapers crammed jails enormous food queues and prowling gangs of armed men. After his return to the front he was wounded in the throat by a snipers bullet. At 6ft 2 in Orwell was considerably taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak and with blood pouring from his mouth Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital in Lleida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service. By the middle of June the political situation in Barcelona had deteriorated and the POUMpainted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a Trotskyist organisationwas outlawed and under attack. The Communist line was that the POUM were objectively Fascist hindering the Republican cause. A particularly nasty poster appeared showing a head with a POUM mask being ripped off to reveal a Swastika-covered face beneath. Members including Kopp were arrested and others were in hiding. Orwell and his wife were under threat and had to lie low although they broke cover to try to help Kopp. Finally with their passports in order they escaped from Spain by train diverting to Banyuls-sur-Mer for a short stay before returning to England. In the first week of July 1937 Orwell arrived back at Wallington; on 13 July 1937 a deposition was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage High Treason in Valencia charging the Orwells with rabid Trotskyism and being agents of the POUM. The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938. Observing events from French Morocco Orwell wrote that they were only a by-product of the Russian Trotskyist trials and from the start every kind of lie including flagrant absurdities has been circulated in the Communist press. Orwells experiences in the Spanish Civil War gave rise to Homage to Catalonia . In his book The International Brigades Fascism Freedom and the Spanish Civil War Giles Tremlett writes that according to Soviet files Orwell and his wife Eileen were spied on in Barcelona in May 1937. The papers are documentary evidence that not only Orwell but also his wife Eileen were being watched closely. Orwell returned to England in June 1937 and stayed at the OShaughnessy home at Greenwich. He found his views on the Spanish Civil War out of favour. Kingsley Martin rejected two of his works and Gollancz was equally cautious. At the same time the communist Daily Worker was running an attack on The Road to Wigan Pier taking out of context Orwell writing that the working classes smell; a letter to Gollancz from Orwell threatening libel action brought a stop to this. Orwell was also able to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views in Fredric Warburg of Secker Warburg. Orwell returned to Wallington which he found in disarray after his absence. He acquired goats a cockerel he called Henry Ford and a poodle puppy he called Marx; and settled down to animal husbandry and writing Homage to Catalonia. There were thoughts of going to India to work on The Pioneer a newspaper in Lucknow but by March 1938 Orwells health had deteriorated. He was admitted to Preston Hall Sanatorium at Aylesford Kent a British Legion hospital for ex-servicemen to which his brother-in-law Laurence OShaughnessy was attached. He was thought initially to be suffering from tuberculosis and stayed in the sanatorium until September. A stream of visitors came to see him including Common Heppenstall Plowman and Cyril Connolly. Connolly brought with him Stephen Spender a cause of some embarrassment as Orwell had referred to Spender as a pansy friend some time earlier. Homage to Catalonia was published in London by Secker Warburg and was a commercial flop; it re-emerged in the 1950s following on the success of Orwells later books. In the latter part of his stay at the clinic Orwell was able to go for walks in the countryside and study nature. The novelist L. H. Myers secretly funded a trip to French Morocco for half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via Gibraltar and Tangier to avoid Spanish Morocco and arrived at Marrakech. They rented a villa on the road to Casablanca and during that time Orwell wrote Coming Up for Air. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and Coming Up for Air was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a Dickens essay and it was in June 1939 that Orwells father Richard Blair died. At the outbreak of the Second World War Orwells wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in central London staying during the week with her family in Greenwich. Orwell also submitted his name to the Central Register for war work but nothing transpired. They wont have me in the army at any rate at present because of my lungs Orwell told Geoffrey Gorer. He returned to Wallington and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays Inside the Whale. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays films and books for The Listener Time and Tide and New Adelphi. On 29 March 1940 his long association with Tribune began with a review of a sergeants account of Napoleons retreat from Moscow. At the beginning of 1940 the first edition of Connollys Horizon appeared and this provided a new outlet for Orwells work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers Chagford Street Marylebone. It was the time of the Dunkirk evacuation and the death in Flanders France of Eileens brother Dr. Laurence OShaughnessy caused her considerable grief and long-term depression. Throughout this period Orwell kept a wartime diary. Orwell was declared unfit for any kind of military service by the Medical Board in June but soon afterwards found an opportunity to become involved in war activities by joining the British Home Guard. He shared Tom Wintringhams socialist vision for the Home Guard as a revolutionary Peoples Militia. His lecture notes for instructing platoon members include advice on street fighting field fortifications and the use of mortars of various kinds. Sergeant Orwell managed to recruit Fredric Warburg to his unit. During the Battle of Britain he used to spend weekends with Warburg and his new Zionist friend Tosco Fyvel at Warburgs house at Twyford Berkshire. At Wallington he worked on England Your England and in London wrote reviews for various periodicals. Visiting Eileens family in Greenwich brought him face-to-face with the effects of the Blitz on East London. In mid-1940 Warburg Fyvel and Orwell planned Searchlight Books. Eleven volumes eventually appeared of which Orwells The Lion and the Unicorn Socialism and the English Genius published on 19 February 1941 was the first. Early in 1941 he began to write for the American Partisan Review which linked Orwell with The New York Intellectuals who were also anti-Stalinist and contributed to the Gollancz anthology The Betrayal of the Left written in the light of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact . He also applied unsuccessfully for a job at the Air Ministry. Meanwhile he was still writing reviews of books and plays and at this time met the novelist Anthony Powell. He also took part in a few radio broadcasts for the Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a seventh-floor flat at Langford Court St Johns Wood while at Wallington Orwell was digging for victory by planting potatoes. In August 1941 Orwell finally obtained war work when he was taken on full-time by the BBCs Eastern Service. When interviewed for the job he indicated that he accept absolutely the need for propaganda to be directed by the government and stressed his view that in wartime discipline in the execution of government policy was essential. He supervised cultural broadcasts to India to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine imperial links. This was Orwells first experience of the rigid conformity of life in an office and it gave him an opportunity to create cultural programmes with contributions from T. S. Eliot Dylan Thomas E. M. Forster Ahmed Ali Mulk Raj Anand and William Empson among others. At the end of August he had a dinner with H. G. Wells which degenerated into a row because Wells had taken offence at observations Orwell made about him in a Horizon article. In October Orwell had a bout of bronchitis and the illness recurred frequently. David Astor was looking for a provocative contributor for The Observer and invited Orwell to write for himthe first article appearing in March 1942. In early 1942 Eileen changed jobs to work at the Ministry of Food and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat a ground floor and basement 10a Mortimer Crescent in Maida ValeKilburnthe kind of lower-middle-class ambience that Orwell thought was London at its best. Around the same time Orwells mother and sister Avril who had found work in a sheet-metal factory behind Kings Cross Station moved into a flat close to George and Eileen. At the BBC Orwell introduced Voice a literary programme for his Indian broadcasts and by now was leading an active social life with literary friends particularly on the political left. Late in 1942 he started writing regularly for the left-wing weekly Tribune directed by Labour MPs Aneurin Bevan and George Strauss. In March 1943 Orwells mother died and around the same time he told Moore he was starting work on a new book which turned out to be Animal Farm. In September 1943 Orwell resigned from the BBC post that he had occupied for two years. His resignation followed a report confirming his fears that few Indians listened to the broadcasts but he was also keen to concentrate on writing Animal Farm. Just six days before his last day of service on 24 November 1943 his adaptation of the fairy tale Hans Christian Andersens The Emperors New Clothes was broadcast. It was a genre in which he was greatly interested and which appeared on Animal Farms title page. At this time he also resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds. In November 1943 Orwell was appointed literary editor at Tribune where his assistant was his old friend Jon Kimche. Orwell was on staff until early 1945 writing over 80 book reviews and on 3 December 1943 started his regular personal column As I Please usually addressing three or four subjects in each. He was still writing reviews for other magazines including Partisan Review Horizon and the New York Nation and becoming a respected pundit among left-wing circles but also a close friend of people on the right such as Powell Astor and Malcolm Muggeridge. By April 1944 Animal Farm was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it considering it an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the war. A similar fate was met from other publishers until Jonathan Cape agreed to take it. In May the Orwells had the opportunity to adopt a child thanks to the contacts of Eileens sister-in-law Gwen OShaughnessy then a doctor in Newcastle upon Tyne. In June a V-1 flying bomb struck Mortimer Crescent and the Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. Orwell had to scrabble around in the rubble for his collection of books which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington carting them away in a wheelbarrow. Another blow was Capes reversal of his plan to publish Animal Farm. The decision followed his personal visit to Peter Smollett an official at the Ministry of Information. Smollett was later identified as a Soviet agent. The Orwells spent some time in the North East near Carlton County Durham dealing with matters in the adoption of a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair. By September 1944 they had set up home in Islington at 27b Canonbury Square. Baby Richard joined them there and Eileen gave up her work at the Ministry of Food to look after her family. Secker Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm planned for the following March although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for The Observer. Orwell had been looking for the opportunity throughout the war but his failed medical reports prevented him from being allowed anywhere near action. He went first to liberated Paris and then to Germany and Austria to such cities as Cologne and Stuttgart. He was never in the front line and was never under fire but he followed the troops closely sometimes entering a captured town within a day of its fall while dead bodies lay in the streets. Some of his reports were published in the Manchester Evening News. It was while he was there that Eileen went into hospital for a hysterectomy and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. She had not given Orwell much notice about this operation because of worries about the cost and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. Orwell returned home for a while and then went back to Europe. He returned finally to London to cover the 1945 general election at the beginning of July. Animal Farm A Fairy Story was published in Britain on 17 August 1945 and a year later in the US on 26 August 1946. Animal Farm had particular resonance in the post-war climate and its worldwide success made Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four years Orwell mixed journalistic workmainly for Tribune The Observer and the Manchester Evening News though he also contributed to many small-circulation political and literary magazineswith writing his best-known work Nineteen Eighty-Four which was published in 1949. He was a leading figure in the so-called Shanghai Club of left-leaning and émigré journalists among them E. H. Carr Sebastian Haffner Isaac Deutscher Barbara Ward and Jon Kimche. In the year following Eileens death he published around 130 articles and a selection of his Critical Essays while remaining active in various political lobbying campaigns. He employed a housekeeper Susan Watson to look after his adopted son at the Islington flat which visitors now described as bleak. In September he spent a fortnight on the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides and saw it as a place to escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was instrumental in arranging a place for Orwell on Jura. Astors family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian Robin Fletcher had a property on the island. In late 1945 and early 1946 Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to younger women including Celia Kirwan ; Ann Popham who happened to live in the same block of flats; and Sonia Brownell one of Connollys coterie at the Horizon office. Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage in February 1946 but disguised his illness. In 1945 or early 1946 while still living at Canonbury Square Orwell wrote an article on British Cookery complete with recipes commissioned by the British Council. Given the post-war shortages both parties agreed not to publish it. His sister Marjorie died of kidney disease in May and soon afterwards on 22 May 1946 Orwell set off to live on the Isle of Jura at a house known as Barnhill. This was an abandoned farmhouse with outbuildings near the northern end of the island at the end of a five-mile heavily rutted track from Ardlussa where the owners lived. Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell. His sister Avril accompanied him there and young novelist Paul Potts made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with Orwells son Richard. Tensions developed and Potts departed after one of his manuscripts was used to light the fire. Orwell meanwhile set to work on Nineteen Eighty-Four. Later Susan Watsons boyfriend David Holbrook arrived. A fan of Orwell since school days he found the reality very different with Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Holbrooks membership of the Communist Party. Watson could no longer stand being with Avril and she and her boyfriend left. Orwell returned to London in late 1946 and picked up his literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer he was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he stayed in London for one of the coldest British winters on record and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his childs toys. The heavy smog in the days before the Clean Air Act 1956 did little to help his health about which he was reticent keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time he co-edited a collection titled British Pamphleteers with Reginald Reynolds. As a result of the success of Animal Farm Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants whose senior partner was Jack Harrison. The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a service agreement so that he could draw a salary. Such a company George Orwell Productions Ltd was set up on 12 September 1947 although the service agreement was not then put into effect. Jack Harrison left the details at this stage to junior colleagues. Orwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947. In July he ended the lease on the Wallington cottage. Back on Jura he worked on Nineteen Eighty-Four and made good progress. During that time his sisters family visited and Orwell led a disastrous boating expedition on 19 August which nearly led to loss of life whilst trying to cross the notorious Gulf of Corryvreckan and gave him a soaking which was not good for his health. In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride then a small village in the countryside on the outskirts of Glasgow. Tuberculosis was diagnosed and the request for permission to import streptomycin to treat Orwell went as far as Aneurin Bevan then Minister of Health. David Astor helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948. By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of Nineteen Eighty-Four. In January 1949 in a very weak condition he set off for a sanatorium at Cranham Gloucestershire escorted by Richard Rees. Unluckily for Orwell streptomycin could not be continued as he developed toxic epidermal necrolysis a rare side effect of streptomycin. The sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the Cotswolds near Stroud. Visitors were shocked by Orwells appearance and concerned by the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about his finances but by now he was comparatively well off. He was writing to many of his friends including Jacintha Buddicom who had rediscovered him and in March 1949 was visited by Celia Kirwan. Kirwan had just started working for a Foreign Office unit the Information Research Department set up by the Labour government to publish anti-communist propaganda and Orwell gave her a list of people he considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings. Orwells list not published until 2003 consisted mainly of writers but also included actors and Labour MPs. To further promote Animal Farm the IRD commissioned cartoon strips drawn by Norman Pett to be placed in newspapers across the globe. Orwell received more streptomycin treatment and improved slightly. This repeat dose of streptomycin especially after the side effect had been noticed has been called ill-advised. He then received penicillin with doctors knowing fully well it was ineffective against tuberculosis. It is presumed it was given to treat his bronchiectasis. In June 1949 Nineteen Eighty-Four was published to critical acclaim. Orwells health continued to decline after the diagnosis of tuberculosis in December 1947. In mid-1949 he courted Sonia Brownell and they announced their engagement in September shortly before he was removed to University College Hospital in London. Sonia took charge of Orwells affairs and attended him diligently in the hospital. Sonia was a beauty and her act of marrying a sick wealthy man when his death was almost certain has left many to doubt her intentions. In September 1949 Orwell invited his accountant Harrison to visit him at the hospital and Harrison claimed that Orwell then asked him to become director of GOP Ltd and to manage the company but there was no independent witness. Orwells wedding took place in the hospital room on 13 October 1949 with David Astor as best man. Orwell was in decline and was visited by an assortment of visitors including Muggeridge Connolly Lucian Freud Stephen Spender Evelyn Waugh Paul Potts Anthony Powell and his Eton tutor Anthony Gow. Plans to go to the Swiss Alps were mooted. Further meetings were held with his accountant at which Harrison and Mr and Mrs Blair were confirmed as directors of the company and at which Harrison claimed that the service agreement was executed giving copyright to the company. Orwells health was in decline again by Christmas. On the evening of 20 January 1950 Potts visited Orwell and slipped away on finding him asleep. Jack Harrison visited later and claimed that Orwell gave him 25 of the company. Early on the morning of 21 January an artery burst in Orwells lungs killing him at age 46. Orwell had requested to be buried in accordance with the Anglican rite in the graveyard of the closest church to wherever he happened to die. The graveyards in central London had no space and so in an effort to ensure his last wishes could be fulfilled his widow appealed to his friends to see whether any of them knew of a church with space in its graveyard. David Astor lived in Sutton Courtenay Berkshire and arranged for Orwell to be interred in the churchyard of All Saints there. Orwells gravestone bears the epitaph Here lies Eric Arthur Blair born June 25th 1903 died January 21st 1950; no mention is made on the gravestone of his more famous pen name. The funeral was organised by Anthony Powell and Malcom Muggeridge. Powell chose the hymns All people that on earth do dwell Guide me O thou great Redeemer and Ten thousand times ten thousand. Orwells adopted son Richard Horatio Blair was brought up by Orwells sister Avril Dunn his legal guardian and her husband Bill Dunn. In 1979 Sonia Brownell brought a High Court action against Harrison when he declared an intention to subdivide his 25 per cent share of the company between his three children. For Sonia the consequence of this manoeuvre would have made getting overall control of the company three times more difficult. She was considered to have a strong case but was becoming increasingly ill and eventually was persuaded to settle out of court on 2 November 1980. She died on 11 December 1980 aged 62. During most of his career Orwell was best known for his journalism in essays reviews columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage Down and Out in Paris and London The Road to Wigan Pier and Homage to Catalonia. According to Irving Howe Orwell was the best English essayist since Hazlitt perhaps since Dr Johnson. Modern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist particularly through his enormously successful titles Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism; the latter life under totalitarian rule. Nineteen Eighty-Four is often compared to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley; both are powerful dystopian novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life. In 1984 Nineteen Eighty-Four and Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451 were honoured with the Prometheus Award for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he received it again for Animal Farm. In 2003 Nineteen Eighty-Four was listed at number 8 and Animal Farm at number 46 on the BBCs The Big Read poll. In 2021 readers of the New York Times Book Review rated Nineteen Eighty-Four third in a list of The best books of the past 125 years. Coming Up for Air his last novel before World War II is the most English of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic Thames-side Edwardian childhood of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England and there were great new external threats. In homely terms its protagonist George Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Franz Borkenau Orwell Ignazio Silone and Koestler Old Hitlers something different. Sos Joe Stalin. They arent like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth just for the fun of it... Theyre something quite newsomething thats never been heard of before. In an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of Twentieth Century Authors in 1940 he wrote The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are Shakespeare Swift Fielding Dickens Charles Reade Flaubert and among modern writers James Joyce T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is W. Somerset Maugham whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills. Elsewhere Orwell strongly praised the works of Jack London especially his book The Road. Orwells investigation of poverty in The Road to Wigan Pier strongly resembles that of Jack Londons The People of the Abyss in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London. In his essay Politics vs. Literature An Examination of Gullivers Travels Orwell wrote If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed I would certainly put Gullivers Travels among them. On H. G. Wells he wrote The minds of all of us and therefore the physical world would be perceptibly different if Wells had never existed. Orwell was an admirer of Arthur Koestler and became a close friend during the three years that Koestler and his wife Mamain spent at the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Orwell reviewed Koestlers Darkness at Noon for the New Statesman in 1941 saying Brilliant as this book is as a novel and a piece of brilliant literature it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow confessions by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that they happenedfor obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian societybut the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify them. Other writers Orwell admired included Ralph Waldo Emerson George Gissing Graham Greene Herman Melville Henry Miller Tobias Smollett Mark Twain Joseph Conrad and Yevgeny Zamyatin. He was both an admirer and a critic of Rudyard Kipling praising Kipling as a gifted writer and a good bad poet whose work is spurious and morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting but undeniably seductive and able to speak to certain aspects of reality more effectively than more enlightened authors. He had a similarly ambivalent attitude to G. K. Chesterton whom he regarded as a writer of considerable talent who had chosen to devote himself to Roman Catholic propaganda and to Evelyn Waugh who was he wrote abt as good a novelist as one can be while holding untenable opinions. Throughout his life Orwell continually supported himself as a book reviewer. His reviews are well known and have had an influence on literary criticism. He wrote in the conclusion to his 1940 essay on Charles Dickens George Woodcock suggested that the last two sentences also describe Orwell. Orwell wrote a critique of George Bernard Shaws play Arms and the Man. He considered this Shaws best play and the most likely to remain socially relevant because of its theme that war is not generally speaking a glorious romantic adventure. His 1945 essay In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouses writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany did not really make him a traitor. He accused The Ministry of Information of exaggerating Wodehouses actions for propaganda purposes. In 1946 the British Council commissioned Orwell to write an essay on British food as part of a drive to promote British relations abroad. In the essay titled British Cookery Orwell described the British diet as a simple rather heavy perhaps slightly barbarous diet and where hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day. He discusses the ritual of breakfast in the UK this is not a snack but a serious meal. The hour at which people have their breakfast is of course governed by the time at which they go to work. He wrote that high tea in the United Kingdom consisted of a variety of savoury and sweet dishes but no tea would be considered a good one if it did not include at least one kind of cake before adding as well as cakes biscuits are much eaten at tea-time. Orwell included a recipe for marmalade a popular British spread on bread. However the British Council declined to publish the essay on the grounds that it was too problematic to write about food at the time of strict rationing in the UK. In 2019 the essay was discovered in the British Councils archives along with the rejection letter. The British Council issued an official apology to Orwell over the rejection of the commissioned essay. Arthur Koestler said that Orwells uncompromising intellectual honesty made him appear almost inhuman at times.Ben Wattenberg stated Orwells writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy wherever he found it. According to historian Piers Brendon Orwell was the saint of common decency who would in earlier days said his BBC boss Rushbrook Williams have been either canonisedor burnt at the stake.Raymond Williams in Politics and Letters Interviews with New Left Review describes Orwell as a successful impersonation of a plain man who bumps into experience in an unmediated way and tells the truth about it.Christopher Norris declared that Orwells homespun empiricist outlookhis assumption that the truth was just there to be told in a straightforward common-sense waynow seems not merely naïve but culpably self-deluding. The American scholar Scott Lucas has described Orwell as an enemy of the Left. John Newsinger has argued that Lucas could only do this by portraying all of Orwells attacks on Stalinism as if they were attacks on socialism despite Orwells continued insistence that they were not. Orwells work has taken a prominent place in the school literature curriculum in England with Animal Farm a regular examination topic at the end of secondary education and Nineteen Eighty-Four a topic for subsequent examinations below university level . A 2016 UK poll saw Animal Farm ranked the nations favourite book from school. Historian John Rodden stated John Podhoretz did claim that if Orwell were alive today hed be standing with the neo-conservatives and against the Left. And the question arises to what extent can you even begin to predict the political positions of somebody whos been dead three decades and more by that time In Orwells Victory Christopher Hitchens argues In answer to the accusation of inconsistency Orwell as a writer was forever taking his own temperature. In other words here was someone who never stopped testing and adjusting his intelligence. John Rodden points out the undeniable conservative features in the Orwell physiognomy and remarks on how to some extent Orwell facilitated the kinds of uses and abuses by the Right that his name has been put to. In other ways there has been the politics of selective quotation. Rodden refers to the essay Why I Write in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his watershed political experience saying The Spanish War and other events in 193637 turned the scale. Thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it. Rodden goes on to explain how during the McCarthy era the introduction to the Signet edition of Animal Farm which sold more than 20 million copies makes use of selective quotation Fyvel wrote about Orwell His crucial experience was his struggle to turn himself into a writer one which led through long periods of poverty failure and humiliation and about which he has written almost nothing directly. The sweat and agony was less in the slum-life than in the effort to turn the experience into literature. In his essay Politics and the English Language Orwell wrote about the importance of precise and clear language arguing that vague writing can be used as a powerful tool of political manipulation because it shapes the way we think. In that essay Orwell provides six rules for writers Orwell worked as a journalist at The Observer for seven years and its editor David Astor gave a copy of this celebrated essay to every new recruit. In 2003 literary editor at the newspaper Robert McCrum wrote Even now it is quoted in our style book. Journalist Jonathan Heawood noted Orwells criticism of slovenly language is still taken very seriously. Andrew N. Rubin argues that Orwell claimed that we should be attentive to how the use of language has limited our capacity for critical thought just as we should be equally concerned with the ways in which dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we use. The adjective Orwellian connotes an attitude and a policy of control by propaganda surveillance misinformation denial of truth and manipulation of the past. In Nineteen Eighty-Four Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from Nineteen Eighty-Four have entered popular language. Newspeak is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. Doublethink means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The Thought Police are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. Prolefeed is homogenised manufactured superficial literature film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. Big Brother is a supreme dictator who watches everyone. Other neologisms from the novel include Two Minutes Hate Room 101 memory hole unperson and thoughtcrime as well as providing direct inspiration for the neologism groupthink. Orwell may have been the first to use the term cold war to refer to the state of tension between powers in the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc that followed World War II in his essay You and the Atom Bomb published in Tribune on 19 October 1945. He wrote Apart from theatre adaptations of his books several stage plays were written with Orwell as one of the main characters. Orwell is the main character in a 2017 novel The Last Man in Europe by Australian author Denis Glover. Orwells birthplace a bungalow in Motihari Bihar India was opened as a museum in May 2015 several years after local residents petitioned for conservation of the building. In January 2021 Orwells bust near the museum was vandalised. Reviews for the George Orwell Birthplace Museum posted on Google since then suggest the museum is not in good shape. The Orwell Society was founded in 2011 to promote understanding of the life and work of George Orwell. A statue of George Orwell sculpted by the British sculptor Martin Jennings was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House the headquarters of the BBC. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with the following phrase If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. These are words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society. Jacintha Buddicoms account Eric Us provides an insight into Blairs childhood. She quoted his sister Avril that he was essentially an aloof undemonstrative person and said herself of his friendship with the Buddicoms I do not think he needed any other friends beyond the schoolfriend he occasionally and appreciatively referred to as CC. She could not recall him having schoolfriends to stay and exchange visits as her brother Prosper often did in holidays.Cyril Connolly provides an account of Blair as a child in Enemies of Promise. Years later Blair mordantly recalled his prep school in the essay Such Such Were the Joys claiming among other things that he was made to study like a dog to earn a scholarship which he alleged was solely to enhance the schools prestige with parents. Jacintha Buddicom repudiated Orwells schoolboy misery described in the essay stating that he was a specially happy child. She noted that he did not like his name because it reminded him of a book he greatly dislikedEric or Little by Little a Victorian boys school story. Connolly remarked of him as a schoolboy The remarkable thing about Orwell was that alone among the boys he was an intellectual and not a parrot for he thought for himself. At Eton John Vaughan Wilkes his former headmasters son at St Cyprians recalled that he was extremely argumentativeabout anythingand criticising the masters and criticising the other boys We enjoyed arguing with him. He would generally win the argumentsor think he had anyhow.Roger Mynors concurs Endless arguments about all sorts of things in which he was one of the great leaders. He was one of those boys who thought for himself. Blair liked to carry out practical jokes. Buddicom recalls him swinging from the luggage rack in a railway carriage like an orangutan to frighten a woman passenger out of the compartment. At Eton he played tricks on John Crace his housemaster among which was to enter a spoof advertisement in a college magazine implying pederasty. Gow his tutor said he made himself as big a nuisance as he could and was a very unattractive boy. Later Blair was expelled from the crammer at Southwold for sending a dead rat as a birthday present to the town surveyor. In one of his As I Please essays he refers to a protracted joke when he answered an advertisement for a woman who claimed a cure for obesity. Blair had an interest in natural history which stemmed from his childhood. In letters from school he wrote about caterpillars and butterflies and Buddicom recalls his keen interest in ornithology. He also enjoyed fishing and shooting rabbits and conducting experiments as in cooking a hedgehog or shooting down a jackdaw from the Eton roof to dissect it. His zeal for scientific experiments extended to explosivesagain Buddicom recalls a cook giving notice because of the noise. Later in Southwold his sister Avril recalled him blowing up the garden. When teaching he enthused his students with his nature-rambles both at Southwold and at Hayes. His adult diaries are permeated with his observations on nature. Buddicom and Blair lost touch shortly after he went to Burma and she became unsympathetic towards him. She wrote that it was because of the letters he wrote complaining about his life but an addendum to Eric Us by Venables reveals that he may have lost her sympathy through an incident which was at best a clumsy attempt at seduction. Mabel Fierz who later became Blairs confidante said He used to say the one thing he wished in this world was that hed been attractive to women. He liked women and had many girlfriends I think in Burma. He had a girl in Southwold and another girl in London. He was rather a womaniser yet he was afraid he wasnt attractive. Brenda Salkield preferred friendship to any deeper relationship and maintained a correspondence with Blair for many years particularly as a sounding board for his ideas. She wrote He was a great letter writer. Endless letters and I mean when he wrote you a letter he wrote pages. His correspondence with Eleanor Jacques was more prosaic dwelling on a closer relationship and referring to past rendezvous or planning future ones in London and Burnham Beeches. When Orwell was in the sanatorium in Kent his wifes friend Lydia Jackson visited. He invited her for a walk and out of sight an awkward situation arose. Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwells marriage to Eileen OShaughnessy but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. Eileen at the time was more concerned about Orwells closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at Tribune which caused Eileen much distress and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen and I also treated her badly and I think she treated me badly too at times but it was a real marriage in the sense that we had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work etc. Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful. There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage. In June 1944 Orwell and Eileen adopted a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio. According to Richard Orwell was a wonderful father who gave him devoted if rather rugged attention and a great degree of freedom. After Orwells death Richard went to live with Orwells sister and her husband. Blair was very lonely after Eileens death in 1945 and desperate for a wife both as companion for himself and as mother for Richard. He proposed marriage to four women including Celia Kirwan and eventually Sonia Brownell accepted. Orwell had met her when she was assistant to Cyril Connolly at Horizon literary magazine. They were married on 13 October 1949 only three months before Orwells death. Some maintain that Sonia was the model for Julia in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Orwell was noted for very close and enduring friendships with a few friends but these were generally people with a similar background or with a similar level of literary ability. Ungregarious he was out of place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the common man he often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin a Hail fellow well met type who took him to a local pub in Leeds said that he was told by the landlord Dont bring that bugger in here again. Adrian Fierz commented He wasnt interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or shove hapenny. He just did not have much in common with people who did not share his intellectual interests. Awkwardness attended many of his encounters with working-class representatives as with Pollitt and McNair but his courtesy and good manners were often commented on. Jack Common observed on meeting him for the first time Right away manners and more than mannersbreedingshowed through. In his tramping days he did domestic work for a time. His extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as Laurel after the film comedian. With his gangling figure and awkwardness Orwells friends often saw him as a figure of fun. Geoffrey Gorer commented He was awfully likely to knock things off tables trip over things. I mean he was a gangling physically badly co-ordinated young man. I think his feeling that even the inanimate world was against him. When he shared a flat with Heppenstall and Sayer he was treated in a patronising manner by the younger men. At the BBC in the 1940s everybody would pull his leg and Spender described him as having real entertainment value like as I say watching a Charlie Chaplin movie. A friend of Eileens reminisced about her tolerance and humour often at Orwells expense. One biography of Orwell accused him of having had an authoritarian streak. In Burma he struck out at a Burmese boy who while fooling around with his friends had accidentally bumped into him at a station resulting in Orwell falling heavily down some stairs. One of his former pupils recalled being beaten so hard he could not sit down for a week. When sharing a flat with Orwell Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained Orwell hit him across the legs with a shooting stick and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later after Orwells death Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called The Shooting Stick and Mabel Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to her in a sorry state the following day. Orwell got on well with young people. The pupil he beat considered him the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink him under the table without success. His nephew recalled Uncle Eric laughing louder than anyone in the cinema at a Charlie Chaplin film. In the wake of his most famous works he attracted many uncritical hangers-on but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his soft voice he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions. At this time he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this people found his circumstances bleak. Some like Michael Ayrton called him Gloomy George but others developed the idea that he was an English secular saint. Although Orwell was frequently heard on the BBC for panel discussion and one-man broadcasts no recorded copy of his voice is known to exist. Orwell was a heavy smoker who rolled his own cigarettes from strong shag tobacco despite his bronchial condition. His penchant for the rugged life often took him to cold and damp situations both in the long term as in Catalonia and Jura and short term for example motorcycling in the rain and suffering a shipwreck. Described by The Economist as perhaps the 20th centurys best chronicler of English culture Orwell considered fish and chips football the pub strong tea cut-price chocolate the movies and radio among the chief comforts for the working class. He advocated a patriotic defence of a British way of life that could not be trusted to intellectuals or by implication the state Orwell enjoyed strong teahe had Fortnum Masons tea brought to him in Catalonia. His 1946 essay A Nice Cup of Tea appeared in the London Evening Standard article on how to make tea with Orwell writing tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country and causes violent disputes over how it should be made with the main issue being whether to put tea in the cup first and add the milk afterward or the other way round on which he states in every family in Britain there are probably two schools of thought on the subject. He appreciated English beer taken regularly and moderately despised drinkers of lager and wrote about an imagined ideal British pub in his 1946 Evening Standard article The Moon Under Water. Not as particular about food he enjoyed the wartime Victory Pie and extolled canteen food at the BBC. He preferred traditional English dishes such as roast beef and kippers. His 1945 essay In Defence of English Cooking included Yorkshire pudding crumpets muffins innumerable biscuits Christmas pudding shortbread various British cheeses and Oxford marmalade. Reports of his Islington days refer to the cosy afternoon tea table. His dress sense was unpredictable and usually casual. In Southwold he had the best cloth from the local tailor but was equally happy in his tramping outfit. His attire in the Spanish Civil War along with his size-12 boots was a source of amusement. David Astor described him as looking like a prep school master while according to the Special Branch dossier Orwells tendency to dress in Bohemian fashion revealed that the author was a Communist. Orwells confusing approach to matters of social decorumon the one hand expecting a working-class guest to dress for dinner and on the other slurping tea out of a saucer at the BBC canteenhelped stoke his reputation as an English eccentric. Orwell was an atheist who identified himself with the humanist outlook on life. Despite this and despite his criticisms of both religious doctrine and religious organisations he nevertheless regularly participated in the social and civic life of the church including by attending Church of England Holy Communion. Acknowledging this contradiction he once said It seems rather mean to go to HC when one doesnt believe but I have passed myself off for pious there is nothing for it but to keep up with the deception. He had two Anglican marriages and left instructions for an Anglican funeral. Orwell was also extremely well-read in Biblical literature and could quote lengthy passages from the Book of Common Prayer from memory. His extensive knowledge of the Bible came coupled with unsparing criticism of its philosophy and as an adult he could not bring himself to believe in its tenets. He said in part V of his essay Such Such Were the Joys that Till about the age of fourteen I believed in God and believed that the accounts given of him were true. But I was well aware that I did not love him. Orwell directly contrasted Christianity with secular humanism in his essay Lear Tolstoy and the Fool finding the latter philosophy more palatable and less self-interested. Literary critic James Wood wrote that in the struggle as he saw it between Christianity and humanism Orwell was on the humanist side of coursebasically an unmetaphysical English version of Camuss philosophy of perpetual godless struggle. Orwells writing was often explicitly critical of religion and Christianity in particular. He found the church to be a selfish church of the landed gentry with its establishment out of touch with the majority of its communicants and altogether a pernicious influence on public life. In their 1972 study The Unknown Orwell the writers Peter Stansky and William Abrahams noted that at Eton Blair displayed a sceptical attitude to Christian belief. Crick observed that Orwell displayed a pronounced anti-Catholicism.Evelyn Waugh writing in 1946 acknowledged Orwells high moral sense and respect for justice but believed he seems never to have been touched at any point by a conception of religious thought and life. His contradictory and sometimes ambiguous views about the social benefits of religious affiliation mirrored the dichotomies between his public and private lives Stephen Ingle wrote that it was as if the writer George Orwell vaunted his unbelief while Eric Blair the individual retained a deeply ingrained religiosity. Orwell liked to provoke arguments by challenging the status quo but he was also a traditionalist with a love of old English values. He criticised and satirised from the inside the various social milieux in which he found himselfprovincial town life in A Clergymans Daughter; middle-class pretension in Keep the Aspidistra Flying; preparatory schools in Such Such Were the Joys; and some socialist groups in The Road to Wigan Pier. In his Adelphi days he described himself as a Tory-anarchist. Of colonialism in Burmese Days he portrays the English colonists as a dull decent people cherishing and fortifying their dullness behind a quarter of a million bayonets. In 1928 Orwell began his career as a professional writer in Paris at a journal owned by the French Communist Henri Barbusse. His first article La Censure en Angleterre was an attempt to account for the extraordinary and illogical moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. His own explanation was that the rise of the puritan middle class who had stricter morals than the aristocracy tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. Orwells first published article in his home country A Farthing Newspaper was a critique of the new French daily the Ami du Peuple. This paper was sold much more cheaply than most others and was intended for ordinary people to read. Orwell pointed out that its proprietor François Coty also owned the right-wing dailies Le Figaro and Le Gaulois which the Ami du Peuple was supposedly competing against. Orwell suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda and predicted the world might soon see free newspapers which would drive legitimate dailies out of business. Writing for Le Progrès Civique Orwell described the British colonial government in Burma and India The Spanish Civil War played the most important part in defining Orwells socialism. He wrote to Cyril Connolly from Barcelona on 8 June 1937 I have seen wonderful things and at last really believe in Socialism which I never did before. Having witnessed anarcho-syndicalist communities for example in Anarchist Catalonia and the subsequent brutal suppression of the anarcho-syndicalists anti-Stalin communist parties and revolutionaries by the Soviet Union-backed Communists Orwell returned from Catalonia a staunch anti-Stalinist and joined the British Independent Labour Party his card being issued on 13 June 1938. In Part 2 of The Road to Wigan Pier published by the Left Book Club Orwell stated that a real Socialist is one who wishesnot merely conceives it as desirable but actively wishesto see tyranny overthrown. Orwell stated in Why I Write Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it. Orwells conception of socialism was of a planned economy alongside democracy which was the common notion of socialism in the early and middle 20th century. Orwells emphasis on democracy primarily referred to a strong emphasis on civil liberties within a socialist economy as opposed to majoritarian rule though he was not necessarily opposed to majority rule. Orwell was a proponent of a federal socialist Europe a position outlined in his 1947 essay Toward European Unity which first appeared in Partisan Review. According to biographer John Newsinger In his 1938 essay Why I joined the Independent Labour Party published in the ILP-affiliated New Leader Orwell wrote Towards the end of the essay he wrote I do not mean I have lost all faith in the Labour Party. My most earnest hope is that the Labour Party will win a clear majority in the next General Election. In 1939 Orwell wrote that Trotsky in exile denounces the Russian dictatorship but he is probably as much responsible for it as any man now living and there is no certainty that as a dictator he would be preferable to Stalin though undoubtedly he has a much more interesting mind. In 1945 he wrote that The fact that Trotskyists are everywhere a persecuted minority and that the accusation usually made against them i.e. of collaborating with the Fascists is obviously false creates the impression that Trotskyism is intellectually and morally superior to Communism; but it is doubtful whether there is much difference. Orwell was opposed to rearmament against Nazi Germany and at the time of the Munich Agreement he signed a manifesto entitled If War Comes We Shall Resistbut he changed his view after the MolotovRibbentrop Pact and the outbreak of the war. He left the ILP because of its opposition to the war and adopted a political position of revolutionary patriotism. On 21 March 1940 he wrote a review of Adolf Hitlers Mein Kampf for The New English Weekly in which he analysed the dictators psychology. According to Orwell a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his mind the way in which his world-view doesnt develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of power politics. Asking how was it that he was able to put monstrous vision across Orwell tried to understand why Hitler was worshipped by the German people The situation in Germany with its seven million unemployed was obviously favourable for demagogues. But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of Mein Kampf and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his speeches...The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. The initial personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is the martyr the victim Prometheus chained to the rock the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how to make it seem like a dragon. In December 1940 he wrote in Tribune We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary. During the war Orwell was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and prosperity. In 1942 commenting on London Times editor E. H. Carrs pro-Soviet views Orwell stated that all the appeasers e.g. Professor E.H. Carr have switched their allegiance from Hitler to Stalin. In his reply to an invitation from the Duchess of Atholl to speak for the British League for European Freedom he stated that he did not agree with their objectives. He admitted that what they said was more truthful than the lying propaganda found in most of the press but added that he could not associate himself with an essentially Conservative body that claimed to defend democracy in Europe but had nothing to say about British imperialism. His closing paragraph stated I belong to the Left and must work inside it much as I hate Russian totalitarianism and its poisonous influence in this country. His relationship to Jews has been a recurring topic in various publications. Texts with an obvious antisemitic slant as well as texts with a determined rejection of antisemitism from different periods of Orwells career and his comments about the increasing conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine under the British Mandate are quoted. Under the headline Orwells evolving views on Jews Raymond S. Solomon draws an arc from Orwells first book Down and Out in Paris and London up to Nineteen Eighty-Four.Anshel Pfeffer asks Was Orwell an anti-Semite in the Israeli daily Haaretz. Paul Seeliger editor of the compilation of Orwells texts On Jews and Antisemitism describes his relationship to antisemitism and Jewish issues as ambivalent. Writing in early 1945 a long essay titled Antisemitism in Britain for the Contemporary Jewish Record Orwell stated that antisemitism was on the increase in Britain and that it was irrational and will not yield to arguments. He argued that it would be useful to discover why anti-Semites could swallow such absurdities on one particular subject while remaining sane on others. He wrote For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald.... Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own anti-Semitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness. In Nineteen Eighty-Four written shortly after the war Orwell portrayed the Party as enlisting anti-Semitic passions against their enemy Goldstein. Orwell joined the staff of Tribune magazine as literary editor and from then until his death was a left-wing Labour-supporting democratic socialist. On 1 September 1944 writing about the Warsaw uprising Orwell expressed in Tribune his hostility against the influence of the alliance with the USSR over the allies Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for. Do not imagine that for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of the sovietic regime or any other regime and then suddenly return to honesty and reason. Once a whore always a whore. According to Newsinger although Orwell was always critical of the 194551 Labour governments moderation his support for it began to pull him to the right politically. This did not lead him to embrace conservatism imperialism or reaction but to defend albeit critically Labour reformism. Between 1945 and 1947 with A. J. Ayer and Bertrand Russell he contributed a series of articles and essays to Polemic a short-lived British Magazine of Philosophy Psychology and Aesthetics edited by the ex-Communist Humphrey Slater. Orwell publicly defended P. G. Wodehouse against charges of being a Nazi sympathiseroccasioned by his agreement to do some broadcasts over the German radio in 1941a defence based on Wodehouses lack of interest in and ignorance of politics. Special Branch the intelligence division of the Metropolitan Police maintained a file on Orwell for more than 20 years of his life. The dossier published by The National Archives states that according to one investigator Orwell had advanced Communist views and several of his Indian friends say that they have often seen him at Communist meetings.MI5 the intelligence department of the Home Office noted It is evident from his recent writingsThe Lion and the Unicornand his contribution to Gollanczs symposium The Betrayal of the Left that he does not hold with the Communist Party nor they with him. Sexual politics plays an important role in Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the novel peoples intimate relationships are strictly governed by the partys Junior Anti-Sex League by opposing sexual relations and instead encouraging artificial insemination. Personally Orwell disliked what he thought as misguided middle-class revolutionary emancipatory views expressing disdain for every fruit-juice drinker nudist sandal-wearer sex-maniacs. Orwell was also openly against homosexuality at a time when such prejudice was common. Speaking at the 2003 George Orwell Centenary Conference Daphne Patai said Of course he was homophobic. That has nothing to do with his relations with his homosexual friends. Certainly he had a negative attitude and a certain kind of anxiety a denigrating attitude towards homosexuality. That is definitely the case. I think his writing reflects that quite fully. Orwell used the homophobic epithets nancy and pansy for example in expressions of contempt for what he called the pansy Left and nancy poets i.e. left-wing homosexual or bisexual writers and intellectuals such as Stephen Spender and W. H. Auden. The protagonist of Keep the Aspidistra Flying Gordon Comstock conducts an internal critique of his customers when working in a bookshop and there is an extended passage of several pages in which he concentrates on a homosexual male customer and sneers at him for his nancy characteristics including a lisp which he identifies in detail with some disgust. Stephen Spender thought Orwells occasional homophobic outbursts were part of his rebellion against the public school. Orwells will requested that no biography of him be written and his widow Sonia Brownell repelled every attempt by those who tried to persuade her to let them write about him. Various recollections and interpretations were published in the 1950s and 1960s but Sonia saw the 1968 Collected Works as the record of his life. She did appoint Malcolm Muggeridge as official biographer but later biographers have seen this as deliberate spoiling as Muggeridge eventually gave up the work. In 1972 two American authors Peter Stansky and William Abrahams produced The Unknown Orwell an unauthorised account of his early years that lacked any support or contribution from Sonia Brownell. Sonia Brownell then commissioned Bernard Crick a professor of politics at the University of London to complete a biography and asked Orwells friends to co-operate. Crick collated a considerable amount of material in his work which was published in 1980 but his questioning of the factual accuracy of Orwells first-person writings led to conflict with Brownell and she tried to suppress the book. Crick concentrated on the facts of Orwells life rather than his character and presented primarily a political perspective on Orwells life and work. After Sonia Brownells death other works on Orwell were published in the 1980s particularly in 1984. These included collections of reminiscences by Audrey Coppard and Crick and Stephen Wadhams. In 1991 Michael Shelden an American professor of literature published a biography. More concerned with the literary nature of Orwells work he sought explanations for Orwells character and treated his first-person writings as autobiographical. Shelden introduced new information that sought to build on Cricks work. Shelden speculated that Orwell possessed an obsessive belief in his failure and inadequacy. Peter Davisons publication of the Complete Works of George Orwell completed in 2000 made most of the Orwell Archive accessible to the public. Jeffrey Meyers a prolific American biographer was first to take advantage of this and published a book in 2001 that investigated the darker side of Orwell and questioned his saintly image.Why Orwell Matters was published by Christopher Hitchens in 2002. In 2003 the centenary of Orwells birth resulted in biographies by Gordon Bowker and D. J. Taylor both academics and writers in the United Kingdom. Taylor notes the stage management which surrounds much of Orwells behaviour and Bowker highlights the essential sense of decency which he considers to have been Orwells main motivation. An updated edition of Taylors biography has been published in 2023 entitled Orwell The New Life published by Constable. In 2018 Ronald Binns published the first detailed study of Orwells years in Suffolk Orwell in Southwold. In 2020 Professor Richard Bradford wrote a new biography entitled Orwell A Man of Our Time while in 2021 Rebecca Solnit reflected on what gardening may have meant to Orwell and what it means to gardeners everywhere in her book Orwells Roses. Two books about Orwells relationship with his first wife Eileen OShaughnessy and her role in his life and career have been published Eileen The Making of George Orwell by Sylvia Topp and Wifedom Mrs Orwells Invisible Life by Anna Funder . According to Blake Morrison after DJ Taylors 2023 Orwell The New Life No further biography will be needed for the foreseeable future though it seems that one or even two of Orwells journals are lying in a Moscow archive.
Samuel Beckett,Samuel Barclay Beckett was an Irish novelist dramatist short story writer theatre director poet and literary translator. His literary and theatrical work features bleak impersonal and tragicomic experiences of life often coupled with black comedy and nonsense. His work became increasingly minimalist as his career progressed involving more aesthetic and linguistic experimentation with techniques of stream of consciousness repetition and self-reference. He is considered one of the last modernist writers and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the Theatre of the Absurd. A resident of Paris for most of his adult life Beckett wrote in both French and English. During the Second World War Beckett was a member of the French Resistance group Gloria SMH and was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1949. He was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature for his writing whichin new forms for the novel and dramain the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation. In 1961 he shared the inaugural Prix International with Jorge Luis Borges. He was the first person to be elected Saoi of Aosdána in 1984. Samuel Barclay Beckett was born in the Dublin suburb of Foxrock on 13 April 1906 the son of William Frank Beckett a quantity surveyor of Huguenot descent and Maria Jones Roe a nurse. His parents were both 35 when he was born and had married in 1901. Beckett had one older brother named Frank Edward . At the age of five he attended a local playschool in Dublin where he started to learn music and then moved to Earlsfort House School near Harcourt Street in Dublin. The Becketts were members of the Church of Ireland; raised as an Anglican Beckett later became agnostic a perspective which informed his writing. Becketts family home Cooldrinagh was a large house and garden complete with tennis court built in 1903 by Becketts father. The house and garden its surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father the nearby Leopardstown Racecourse the Foxrock railway station and Harcourt Street station would all feature in his prose and plays.  Around 1919 or 1920 he went to Portora Royal School in Enniskillen which Oscar Wilde had also attended. He left in 1923 and entered Trinity College Dublin where he studied modern literature and Romance languages and received his bachelors degree in 1927. A natural athlete he excelled at cricket as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. Later he played for Dublin University and played two first-class games against Northamptonshire. As a result he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played first-class cricket. According to Michael Dirda Beckett is the only Nobel laureate in Wisdens the bible of cricket history. Beckett studied French Italian and English at Trinity College Dublin from 1923 to 1927 . He was elected a Scholar in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a BA and after teaching briefly at Campbell College in Belfast took up the post of lecteur danglais at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris from November 1928 to 1930. While there he was introduced to renowned Irish author James Joyce by Thomas MacGreevy a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways one of which was research towards the book that became Finnegans Wake. In 1929 Beckett published his first work a critical essay titled Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce. The essay defends Joyces work and method chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness and was Becketts contribution to Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress . Becketts close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled however when he rejected the advances of Joyces daughter Lucia. Becketts first short story Assumption was published in Jolass periodical transition. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem Whoroscope which draws on a biography of René Descartes that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit. In 1930 Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930 he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the Toulouse poet Jean du Chas founder of a movement called le Concentrisme. It was a literary parody for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be at odds with all that is clear and distinct in Descartes. Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience. When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931 his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem Gnome which was inspired by his reading of Johann Wolfgang Goethes Wilhelm Meisters Apprenticeship and eventually published in The Dublin Magazine in 1934 Spend the years of learning squanderingCourage for the years of wanderingThrough a world politely turningFrom the loutishness of learning Beckett travelled throughout Europe. He spent some time in London where in 1931 he published Proust his critical study of French author Marcel Proust. Two years later following his fathers death he began two years treatment with Tavistock Clinic psychoanalyst Dr. Wilfred Bion. Aspects of it became evident in Becketts later works such as Watt and Waiting for Godot. In 1932 he wrote his first novel Dream of Fair to Middling Women but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it . Despite his inability to get it published however the novel served as a source for many of Becketts early poems as well as for his first full-length book the 1933 short-story collection More Pricks Than Kicks. Beckett published essays and reviews including Recent Irish Poetry and Humanistic Quietism a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevys Poems . They focused on the work of MacGreevy Brian Coffey Denis Devlin and Blanaid Salkeld despite their slender achievements at the time comparing them favourably with their Celtic Revival contemporaries and invoking Ezra Pound T. S. Eliot and the French symbolists as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic modernist canon. In 1935the year that he successfully published a book of his poetry Echos Bones and Other PrecipitatesBeckett worked on his novel Murphy. In May he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with Sergei Eisenstein at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this however as Becketts letter was lost owing to Eisensteins quarantine during the smallpox outbreak as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production. In 1936 a friend had suggested he look up the works of Arnold Geulincx which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosophers name is mentioned in Murphy and the reading apparently left a strong impression.Murphy was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the Nazi savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937 he oversaw the publication of Murphy which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939 preferring in his own words France at war to Ireland at peace. His was soon a known face in and around Left Bank cafés where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists Alberto Giacometti and Marcel Duchamp with whom he regularly played chess. Sometime around December 1937 Beckett had a brief affair with Peggy Guggenheim who nicknamed him Oblomov . In January 1938 in Paris Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious pimp . Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil who knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time however the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied Je ne sais pas Monsieur. Je mexcuse . Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attackerpartially to avoid further formalities partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered. After the Nazi German occupation of France in 1940 Beckett joined the French Resistance in which he worked as a courier. On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the Gestapo. In August 1942 his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of Roussillon in the Vaucluse département in Provence-Alpes-Côte dAzur. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the Maquis sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life. He was awarded the Croix de guerre and the Médaille de la Résistance by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life however Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as boy scout stuff. While in hiding in Roussillon Beckett continued work on the novel Watt. He started the novel in 1941 and completed it in 1945 but it was not published until 1953; however an extract had appeared in the Dublin literary periodical Envoy. After the war he returned to France in 1946 where he worked as a stores manager at the Irish Red Cross Hospital based in Saint-Lô. Beckett described his experiences in an untransmitted radio script The Capital of the Ruins. In 1945 Beckett returned to Dublin for a brief visit. During his stay he had a revelation in his mothers room his entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce certain to never beat him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and to acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence Knowlson argues that Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future his work would focus on poverty failure exile and loss as he put it on man as a non-knower and as a non-can-er. The revelation has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career. Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play Krapps Last Tape . While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life Krapp hears his younger self say clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most... at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape . Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are precious ally. In 1946 Jean-Paul Sartres magazine published the first part of Becketts short story Suite not realising that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; Simone de Beauvoir refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel Mercier et Camier which was not published until 1970. The novel presaged his most famous work the play Waiting for Godot which was written not long afterwards. More importantly the novel was Becketts first long work that he wrote in French the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by Jérôme Lindon director of his Parisian publishing house including the poioumenon trilogy of novels Molloy ; Malone Dies ; The Unnamable . Despite being a native English speaker Beckett wrote in French becauseas he himself claimedit was easier for him thus to write without style. Beckett is most famous for his play . Like most of his works after 1947 the play was first written in French. Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949. His partner Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil was integral to its success. Dechevaux-Dumesnil became his agent and sent the manuscript to multiple producers until they met Roger Blin the soon-to-be director of the play. Blins knowledge of French theatre and vision alongside Beckett knowing what he wanted the play to represent contributed greatly to its success. In a much-quoted article the critic Vivian Mercier wrote that Beckett has achieved a theoretical impossibilitya play in which nothing happens that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. Whats more since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first he has written a play in which nothing happens twice. The play was published in 1952 and premièred in 1953 in Paris; an English translation was performed two years later. The play was a critical popular and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in The Sunday Times and later Kenneth Tynan. After the showing in Miami the play became extremely popular with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. The play is a favourite it is not only performed frequently but has globally inspired playwrights to emulate it. This is the sole play the manuscript of which Beckett never sold donated or gave away. He refused to allow the play to be translated into film but did allow it to be played on television. During this time in the 1950s Beckett became one of several adults who sometimes drove local children to school; one such child was André Roussimoff who would later become a famous professional wrestler under the name André the Giant. They had a surprising amount of common ground and bonded over their love of cricket with Roussimoff later recalling that the two rarely talked about anything else. Beckett translated all of his works into English himself with the exception of Molloy for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of Waiting for Godot opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays including Krapps Last Tape Happy Days and Play . In 1961 Beckett received the International Publishers Formentor Prize in recognition of his work which he shared that year with Jorge Luis Borges. The 1960s were a time of change for Beckett both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961 he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England . The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957 he had his first commission from the BBC Third Programme for a radio play All That Fall. He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again although he also wrote in French until the end of his life. He bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet about 60 kilometres northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals. From the late 1950s until his death Beckett had a relationship with Barbara Bray a widow who worked as a script editor for the BBC. Knowlson wrote of them She was small and attractive but above all keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last in parallel with that with Suzanne for the rest of his life. Barbara Bray died in Edinburgh on 25 February 2010. In 1969 the avant-garde filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim shot an experimental short film portrait about Beckett which he named after the writer. In October 1969 while on holiday in Tunis with Suzanne Beckett heard that he had won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on Suzanne called the award a catastrophe. While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews he sometimes met the artists scholars and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM Saint-Jacques in Paris where he gave his appointments and took frequently his lunches near his Montparnasse home. Although Beckett was an intensely private man a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster on 15 December 2011 issue of The New Republic reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it. Suzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from emphysema and possibly Parkinsons disease Beckett died a few months later on 22 December. The two were interred together in the cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Becketts directive that it should be any colour so long as its grey. Becketts career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods his early works up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period from the early 1960s until Becketts death in 1989 during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more minimalist. Becketts earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the authors learning merely for its own sake resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection More Pricks than Kicks affords a representative sample of this style It was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there Dante also and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular. The passage makes reference to Dantes Commedia which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Becketts later work the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the characters immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence. Similar elements are present in Becketts first published novel Murphy which also explores the themes of insanity and chess . The novels opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and black humour that animate many of Becketts works The sun shone having no alternative on the nothing new.Watt written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a mathematical permutation presaging Becketts later preoccupationin both his novels and dramatic workswith precise movement. Becketts 1930 essay Proust was strongly influenced by Schopenhauers pessimism and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparsenessin contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period collected in Echos Bones and Other Precipitates seems to show that Beckett albeit through the medium of another language was in process of simplifying his style a change also evidenced in Watt. After World War II Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this together with the revelation experienced in his mothers room in Dublinin which he realised that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner worldthat would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today. During the 15 years following the war Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays En attendant Godot Fin de partie Krapps Last Tape and Happy Days . These playswhich are often considered rightly or wrongly to have been instrumental in the so-called Theatre of the Absurddeal in a darkly humorous way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary existentialist thinkers. The term Theatre of the Absurd was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and Godot were centrepieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of Albert Camuss concept of the absurd; this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labelled as an existentialist . Though many of the themes are similar Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole. Broadly speaking the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nellone of the two characters in Endgame who are trapped in ashbins from which they occasionally peek their heads to speakcan best summarise the themes of the plays of Becketts middle period Nothing is funnier than unhappiness I grant you that. ... Yes yes its the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh we laugh with a will in the beginning. But its always the same thing. Yes its like the funny story we have heard too often we still find it funny but we dont laugh any more. Becketts outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels Molloy Malone meurt and Linnommable . In these novelssometimes referred to as a trilogy though this is against the authors own explicit wishesthe prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down.Molloy for instance still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel and it makes use of the structure of a detective novel. In Malone Dies movement and plot are largely dispensed with though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the action of the book takes the form of an interior monologue. Finally in The Unnamable almost all sense of place and time are abolished and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voices drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Becketts work as exemplified by the novels of this period is essentially pessimistic the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness for instance the famous final phrase of The Unnamable I cant go on Ill go on. After these three novels Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose a struggle evidenced by the brief stories later collected as Texts for Nothing. In the late 1950s however he created one of his most radical prose works Comment cest . An early variant version of Comment cest LImage was published in the British arts review X A Quarterly Review and is the first appearance of the novel in any form. This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then its over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasnt over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark Following this work it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. How It Is is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer. Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s Becketts works exhibited an increasing tendencyalready evident in much of his work of the 1950stowards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as minimalist. The extreme example of this among his dramatic works is the 1969 piece Breath which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters . In his theatre of the late period Becketts charactersalready few in number in the earlier playsare whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled Play for instance consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama Eh Joe which was written for the actor Jack MacGowran is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play Not I consists almost solely of in Becketts words a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness. Following from Krapps Last Tape many of these later plays explore memory often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self-confined and observed with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonists head or else another character comments on the protagonist silently by means of gesture . Becketts most politically charged play Catastrophe which was dedicated to Václav Havel deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity Becketts poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of mirlitonnades with some as short as six words long. These defied Becketts usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers including Derek Mahon have attempted translations but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English. Becketts prose pieces during the late period were not so prolific as his theatre as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles . Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said and Worstward Ho later collected in Nohow On. In these three closed space stories Beckett continued his pre-occupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self as well as with the positioning of bodies in space as the opening phrases of Company make clear A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine. To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said. Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces including Company and Rockaby. In the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days Beckett wrote his last work the 1988 poem What is the Word . The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself a theme echoing Becketts earlier work though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life. Jack MacGowran was the first actor to do a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted End of Day in Dublin in 1962 revising it as Beginning To End . The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 19701971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett. Beckett wrote the radio play Embers and the teleplay Eh Joe specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of Waiting for Godot and Endgame and did several readings of Becketts plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP MacGowran Speaking Beckett for Claddagh Records in 1966. Billie Whitelaw worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I Eh Joe Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography Billie Whitelaw... Who He she describes their first meeting in 1963 as trust at first sight. Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse the supreme interpreter of his work perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked and he thought for a bit and then said Inward . She said of her role in Footfalls I felt like a moving musical Edvard Munch painting and in fact when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting. Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted she explained. With all of Sams work the scream was there my task was to try to get it out. She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died. The English stage designer Jocelyn Herbert was a close friend and influence on Beckett until his death. She worked with him on such plays as Happy Days and Krapps Last Tape at the Royal Court Theatre. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesnt want to bang the nail on the head. Generally speaking there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate and this has never been the case with Jocelyn. The German director Walter D. Asmus began his working relationship with Beckett in the Schiller Theatre in Berlin in 1974 and continued until 1989 the year of the playwrights death. Asmus has directed all of Becketts plays internationally. Of all the English-language modernists Becketts work represents the most sustained attack on the realist tradition. He opened up the possibility of theatre and fiction that dispense with conventional plot and the unities of time and place to focus on essential components of the human condition. Václav Havel John Banville Aidan Higgins Tom Stoppard Harold Pinter and Jon Fosse have publicly stated their indebtedness to Becketts example. He has had a wider influence on experimental writing since the 1950s from the Beat generation to the happenings of the 1960s and after. In an Irish context he has exerted great influence on poets such as Derek Mahon and Thomas Kinsella as well as writers like Trevor Joyce and Catherine Walsh who proclaim their adherence to the modernist tradition as an alternative to the dominant realist mainstream. Many major 20th-century composers including Luciano Berio György Kurtág Morton Feldman Pascal Dusapin Philip Glass Roman Haubenstock-Ramati and Heinz Holliger have created musical works based on Becketts texts. His work has also influenced numerous international writers artists and filmmakers including Edward Albee Avigdor Arikha Paul Auster J. M. CoetzeeRichard Kalich Douglas Gordon Bruce Nauman Anthony MinghellaDamian PettigrewCharlie Kaufman and Brian Patrick Butler. Beckett is one of the most widely discussed and highly prized of 20th-century authors inspiring a critical industry to rival that which has sprung up around James Joyce. He has divided critical opinion. Some early philosophical critics such as Sartre and Theodor Adorno praised him one for his revelation of absurdity the other for his works critical refusal of simplicities; others such as Georg Lukács condemned him for decadent lack of realism. Since Becketts death all rights for performance of his plays are handled by the Beckett estate currently managed by Edward Beckett . The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Becketts plays are performed and does not grant licences to productions that do not adhere to the writers stage directions. Historians interested in tracing Becketts blood line were in 2004 granted access to confirmed trace samples of his DNA to conduct molecular genealogical studies to facilitate precise lineage determination. Some of the best-known pictures of Beckett were taken by photographer John Minihan who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such a good relationship with the writer that he became in effect his official photographer. Some consider one of these to be among the top three photographs of the 20th century. It was the theatre photographer John Haynes however who took possibly the most widely reproduced image of Beckett it is used on the cover of the Knowlson biography for instance. This portrait was taken during rehearsals of the San Quentin Drama Workshop at the Royal Court Theatre in London where Haynes photographed many productions of Becketts work.An Post the Irish postal service issued a commemorative stamp of Beckett in 1994. The Central Bank of Ireland launched two Samuel Beckett Centenary commemorative coins on 26 April 2006 10 Silver Coin and 20 Gold Coin. On 10 December 2009 the new bridge across the River Liffey in Dublin was opened and named the Samuel Beckett Bridge in his honour. Reminiscent of a harp on its side it was designed by the celebrated Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava who had also designed the James Joyce Bridge situated further upstream and opened on Bloomsday 2003. Attendees at the official opening ceremony included Becketts niece Caroline Murphy his nephew Edward Beckett poet Seamus Heaney and Barry McGovern. A ship of the Irish Naval Service the LÉ Samuel Beckett is named for Beckett. An Ulster History Circle blue plaque in his memory is located at Portora Royal School Enniskillen County Fermanagh. In La Ferté-sous-Jouarre the town where Beckett had a cottage the public library and one of the local high schools bear his name. Happy Days Enniskillen International Beckett Festival is an annual multi-arts festival celebrating the work and influence of Beckett. The festival founded in 2011 is held at Enniskillen Northern Ireland where Beckett spent his formative years studying at Portora Royal School. In 1983 the Samuel Beckett Award was established for writers who in the opinion of a committee of critics producers and publishers showed innovation and excellence in writing for the performing arts. In 2003 The Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust was formed to support the showcasing of new innovative theatre at the Barbican Centre in the City of London. Music for three Samuel Beckett plays was composed by Martin Pearlman which was commissioned by the 92nd Street Y in New York for the Beckett centennial and produced there and at Harvard University. In January 2019 Beckett was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time. In 2022 James Marsh filmed a biopic of Beckett entitled Dance First with Gabriel Byrne and Fionn OShea playing Beckett at different stages of his life. The film is expected to be available through Sky Cinema in 2023. Samuel Becketts prolific career is spread across archives around the world.

W. H. Auden,Wystan Hugh Auden was a British-American poet. Audens poetry was noted for its stylistic and technical achievement its engagement with politics morals love and religion and its variety in tone form and content. Some of his best known poems are about love such as Funeral Blues; on political and social themes such as September 1 1939 and The Shield of Achilles; on cultural and psychological themes such as The Age of Anxiety; and on religious themes such as For the Time Being and Horae Canonicae. He was born in York and grew up in and near Birmingham in a professional middle-class family. He attended various English independent schools and studied English at Christ Church Oxford. After a few months in Berlin in 192829 he spent five years teaching in British private preparatory schools then travelled to Iceland and China to write books about his journeys. In 1939 he moved to the United States and became an American citizen in 1946 retaining his British citizenship. He taught from 1941 to 1945 in American universities followed by occasional visiting professorships in the 1950s. From 1947 to 1957 he wintered in New York and summered in Ischia; from 1958 until the end of his life he wintered in New York and summered in Kirchstetten Lower Austria. He came to wide public attention with his first book Poems at the age of twenty-three in 1930; it was followed in 1932 by The Orators. Three plays written in collaboration with Christopher Isherwood between 1935 and 1938 built his reputation as a left-wing political writer. Auden moved to the United States partly to escape this reputation and his work in the 1940s including the long poems For the Time Being and The Sea and the Mirror focused on religious themes. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1947 long poem The Age of Anxiety the title of which became a popular phrase describing the modern era. From 1956 to 1961 he was Professor of Poetry at Oxford; his lectures were popular with students and faculty and served as the basis for his 1962 prose collection The Dyers Hand. Auden and Isherwood maintained a lasting but intermittent sexual relationship from around 1927 to 1939 while both also had briefer but more intense relations with other men. In 1939 Auden fell in love with Chester Kallman and regarded their relationship as a marriage but this ended in 1941 when Kallman refused to accept the faithful relations that Auden demanded. However the two maintained their friendship and from 1947 until Audens death they lived in the same house or apartment in a non-sexual relationship often collaborating on opera libretti such as that of The Rakes Progress to music by Igor Stravinsky. Auden was a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on literary political psychological and religious subjects and he worked at various times on documentary films poetic plays and other forms of performance. Throughout his career he was both controversial and influential and critical views on his work ranged from sharply dismissivetreating him as a lesser figure than W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliotto strongly affirmative as in Joseph Brodskys statement that he had the greatest mind of the twentieth century. After his death his poems became known to a much wider public through films broadcasts and popular media. Auden was born at 54 Bootham York England to George Augustus Auden a physician and Constance Rosalie Auden who had trained as a missionary nurse. He was the third of three sons; the eldest George Bernard Auden became a farmer while the second John Bicknell Auden became a geologist. The Audens were minor gentry with a strong clerical tradition originally of Rowley Regis later of Horninglow Staffordshire. Auden whose grandfathers were both Church of England clergymen grew up in an Anglo-Catholic household that followed a High form of Anglicanism with doctrine and ritual resembling those of Roman Catholicism. He traced his love of music and language partly to the church services of his childhood. He believed he was of Icelandic descent and his lifelong fascination with Icelandic legends and Old Norse sagas is evident in his work. His family moved to Homer Road in Solihull near Birmingham in 1908 where his father had been appointed the School Medical Officer and Lecturer of Public Health. Audens lifelong psychoanalytic interests began in his fathers library. From the age of eight he attended boarding schools returning home for holidays. His visits to the Pennine landscape and its declining lead-mining industry figure in many of his poems; the remote decaying mining village of Rookhope was for him a sacred landscape evoked in a late poem Amor Loci. Until he was fifteen he expected to become a mining engineer but his passion for words had already begun. He wrote later words so excite me that a pornographic story for example excites me sexually more than a living person can do. Auden attended St Edmunds School Hindhead Surrey where he met Christopher Isherwood later famous in his own right as a novelist. At thirteen he went to Greshams School in Holt Norfolk; there in 1922 when his friend Robert Medley asked him if he wrote poetry Auden first realised his vocation was to be a poet. Soon after he discover that he lost his faith . In school productions of Shakespeare he played Katherina in The Taming of the Shrew in 1922 and Caliban in The Tempest in 1925 his last year at Greshams. A review of his performance as Katherina noted that despite a poor wig he had been able to infuse considerable dignity into his passionate outbursts. His first published poems appeared in the school magazine in 1923. Auden later wrote a chapter on Greshams for Graham Greenes The Old School Essays by Divers Hands . In 1925 he went up to Christ Church Oxford with a scholarship in biology; he switched to English by his second year and was introduced to Old English poetry through the lectures of J. R. R. Tolkien. Friends he met at Oxford include Cecil Day-Lewis Louis MacNeice and Stephen Spender; these four were commonly though misleadingly identified in the 1930s as the Auden Group for their shared left-wing views. Auden left Oxford in 1928 with a third-class degree. Auden was reintroduced to Christopher Isherwood in 1925 by his fellow student A. S. T. Fisher. For the next few years Auden sent poems to Isherwood for comments and criticism; the two maintained a sexual friendship in intervals between their relations with others. In 193539 they collaborated on three plays and a travel book. From his Oxford years onward Audens friends uniformly described him as funny extravagant sympathetic generous and partly by his own choice lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits and obsessive about meeting deadlines while choosing to live amidst physical disorder. In late 1928 Auden left Britain for nine months going to Berlin perhaps partly as an escape from English repressiveness. In Berlin he first experienced the political and economic unrest that became one of his central subjects. Around the same time Stephen Spender privately printed a small pamphlet of Audens Poems in an edition of about 45 copies distributed among Audens and Spenders friends and family; this edition is usually referred to as Poems to avoid confusion with Audens commercially published 1930 volume. On returning to Britain in 1929 he worked briefly as a tutor. In 1930 his first published book Poems was accepted by T. S. Eliot for Faber and Faber and the same firm remained the British publisher of all the books he published thereafter. In 1930 he began five years as a schoolmaster in boys schools two years at the Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh Scotland then three years at the Downs School in the Malvern Hills where he was a much-loved teacher. At the Downs in June 1933 he experienced what he later described as a Vision of Agape while sitting with three fellow-teachers at the school when he suddenly found that he loved them for themselves that their existence had infinite value for him; this experience he said later influenced his decision to return to the Anglican Church in 1940. During these years Audens erotic interests focused as he later said on an idealised Alter Ego rather than on individual persons. His relationships tended to be unequal either in age or intelligence; his sexual relations were transient although some evolved into long friendships. He contrasted these relationships with what he later regarded as the marriage of equals that he began with Chester Kallman in 1939 based on the unique individuality of both partners. In 1935 Auden married Erika Mann the lesbian novelist daughter of Thomas Mann when it became apparent that the Nazis were intending to strip her of her German citizenship. Mann had asked Christopher Isherwood if he would marry her so she could become a British citizen. He declined but suggested she approach Auden who readily agreed to a marriage of convenience. Mann and Auden never lived together but remained on good terms throughout their lives and were still married when Mann died in 1969. She left him a small bequest in her will. In 1936 Auden introduced actress Therese Giehse Manns lover to the writer John Hampson and they too married so that Giehse could leave Germany. From 1935 until he left Britain early in 1939 Auden worked as freelance reviewer essayist and lecturer first with the GPO Film Unit a documentary film-making branch of the post office headed by John Grierson. Through his work for the Film Unit in 1935 he met and collaborated with Benjamin Britten with whom he also worked on plays song cycles and a libretto. Audens plays in the 1930s were performed by the Group Theatre in productions that he supervised to varying degrees. His work now reflected his belief that any good artist must be more than a bit of a reporting journalist. In 1936 Auden spent three months in Iceland where he gathered material for a travel book Letters from Iceland written in collaboration with Louis MacNeice. In 1937 he went to Spain intending to drive an ambulance for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War but was put to work writing propaganda at the Republican press and propaganda office where he felt useless and left after a week. He returned to England after a brief visit to the front at Sarineña. His seven-week visit to Spain affected him deeply and his social views grew more complex as he found political realities to be more ambiguous and troubling than he had imagined. Again attempting to combine reportage and art he and Isherwood spent six months in 1938 visiting China amid the Sino-Japanese War working on their book Journey to a War . On their way back to England they stayed briefly in New York and decided to move to the United States. Auden spent late 1938 partly in England partly in Brussels. Many of Audens poems during the 1930s and after were inspired by unconsummated love and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet If equal affection cannot be Let the more loving one be me . He had a gift for friendship and starting in the late 1930s a strong wish for the stability of marriage; in a letter to his friend James Stern he called marriage the only subject. Throughout his life Auden performed charitable acts sometimes in public as in his 1935 marriage of convenience to Erika Mann but especially in later years more often in private. He was embarrassed if they were publicly revealed as when his gift to his friend Dorothy Day for the Catholic Worker movement was reported on the front page of The New York Times in 1956. In 1941 Kallman ended their sexual relationship because he could not accept Audens insistence on mutual fidelity but he and Auden remained companions for the rest of Audens life sharing houses and apartments from 1953 until Audens death. Auden dedicated both editions of his collected poetry to Isherwood and Kallman. In 194041 Auden lived in a house at 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn Heights that he shared with Carson McCullers Benjamin Britten and others which became a famous centre of artistic life nicknamed February House. In 1940 Auden joined the Episcopal Church returning to the Anglican Communion he had abandoned at fifteen. His reconversion was influenced partly by what he called the sainthood of Charles Williams whom he had met in 1937 and partly by reading Søren Kierkegaard and Reinhold Niebuhr; his existential this-worldly Christianity became a central element in his life. After Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939 Auden told the British embassy in Washington that he would return to the UK if needed. He was told that among those his age only qualified personnel were needed. In 194142 he taught English at the University of Michigan. He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942 but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 194243 but did not use it choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 194245. In mid-1945 after the end of World War II in Europe he was in Germany with the US Strategic Bombing Survey studying the effects of Allied bombing on German morale an experience that affected his postwar work as his visit to Spain had affected him earlier. On his return he settled in Manhattan working as a freelance writer a lecturer at The New School for Social Research and a visiting professor at Bennington Smith and other American colleges. In 1946 he became a naturalised citizen of the US. In 1948 Auden began spending his summers in Europe together with Chester Kallman first in Ischia Italy where he rented a house. Then starting in 1958 he began spending his summers in Kirchstetten Austria where he bought a farmhouse from the prize money of the Premio Feltrinelli awarded to him in 1957. He said that he shed tears of joy at owning a home for the first time. His later poetry mostly written in Austria includes his sequence Thanksgiving for a Habitat about his Kirchstetten home. Audens letters and papers sent to his friend the translator Stella Musulin available online provide insights into his Austrian years. In 195661 Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to spend winter in New York where he lived at 77 St. Marks Place in Manhattans East Village and to spend summer in Europe spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours and by writing for The New Yorker The New York Review of Books and other magazines. In 1963 Kallman left the apartment he shared in New York with Auden and lived during the winter in Athens while continuing to spend his summers with Auden in Austria. In February 1972 Auden moved his winter home from New York to Oxford where his old college Christ Church offered him a cottage while he continued to spend summers in Austria with Kallman. He spent only one winter in Oxford before his death in 1973. Auden died at 66 of heart failure at the Altenburgerhof Hotel in Vienna overnight on 2829 September 1973 a few hours after giving a reading of his poems at the Austrian Society for Literature. He was intending to return to Oxford the following day. He was buried on 4 October in Kirchstetten and in London a memorial stone was placed in Westminster Abbey a year later. Auden published about four hundred poems including seven long poems . His poetry was encyclopaedic in scope and method ranging in style from obscure twentieth-century modernism to the lucid traditional forms such as ballads and limericks from doggerel through haiku and villanelles to a Christmas Oratorio and a baroque eclogue in Anglo-Saxon meters. The tone and content of his poems ranged from pop-song clichés to complex philosophical meditations from the corns on his toes to atoms and stars from contemporary crises to the evolution of society. He also wrote more than four hundred essays and reviews about literature history politics music religion and many other subjects. He collaborated on plays with Christopher Isherwood and on opera libretti with Chester Kallman and worked with a group of artists and filmmakers on documentary films in the 1930s and with the New York Pro Musica early music group in the 1950s and 1960s. About collaboration he wrote in 1964 collaboration has brought me greater erotic joy ... than any sexual relations I have had. Auden controversially rewrote or discarded some of his most famous poems when he prepared his later collected editions. He wrote that he rejected poems that he found boring or dishonest in the sense that they expressed views he had never held but had used only because he felt they would be rhetorically effective. His rejected poems include Spain and September 1 1939. His literary executor Edward Mendelson argues in his introduction to Selected Poems that Audens practice reflected his sense of the persuasive power of poetry and his reluctance to misuse it.  Auden began writing poems in 1922 at fifteen mostly in the styles of 19th-century romantic poets especially Wordsworth and later poets with rural interests especially Thomas Hardy. At eighteen he discovered T.S. Eliot and adopted an extreme version of Eliots style. He found his own voice at twenty when he wrote the first poem later included in his collected work From the very first coming down. This and other poems of the late 1920s tended to be in a clipped elusive style that alluded to but did not directly state their themes of loneliness and loss. Twenty of these poems appeared in his first book Poems a pamphlet hand-printed by Stephen Spender. In 1928 he wrote his first dramatic work Paid on Both Sides subtitled A Charade which combined style and content from the Icelandic sagas with jokes from English school life. This mixture of tragedy and farce with a dream play-within-a-play introduced the mixed styles and content of much of his later work. This drama and thirty short poems appeared in his first published book Poems ; the poems in the book were mostly lyrical and gnomic meditations on hoped-for or unconsummated love and on themes of personal social and seasonal renewal; among these poems were It was Easter as I walked Doom is dark Sir no mans enemy and This lunar beauty. A recurrent theme in these early poems is the effect of family ghosts Audens term for the powerful unseen psychological effects of preceding generations on any individual life . A parallel theme present throughout his work is the contrast between biological evolution and the psychological evolution of cultures and individuals . Audens next large-scale work was The Orators An English Study in verse and prose largely about hero-worship in personal and political life. In his shorter poems his style became more open and accessible and the exuberant Six Odes in The Orators reflect his new interest in Robert Burns. During the next few years many of his poems took their form and style from traditional ballads and popular songs and also from expansive classical forms like the Odes of Horace which he seems to have discovered through the German poet Hölderlin. Around this time his main influences were Dante William Langland and Alexander Pope. During these years much of his work expressed left-wing views and he became widely known as a political poet although he was privately more ambivalent about revolutionary politics than many reviewers recognised and Mendelson argues that he expounded political views partly out of a sense of moral duty and partly because it enhanced his reputation and that he later regretted having done so. He generally wrote about revolutionary change in terms of a change of heart a transformation of a society from a closed-off psychology of fear to an open psychology of love. His verse drama The Dance of Death was a political extravaganza in the style of a theatrical revue which Auden later called a nihilistic leg-pull. His next play The Dog Beneath the Skin written in collaboration with Isherwood was similarly a quasi-Marxist updating of Gilbert and Sullivan in which the general idea of social transformation was more prominent than any specific political action or structure. The Ascent of F6 another play written with Isherwood was partly an anti-imperialist satire partly an examination of Audens own motives in taking on a public role as a political poet. This play included the first version of Funeral Blues written as a satiric eulogy for a politician; Auden later rewrote the poem as a Cabaret Song about lost love . In 1935 he worked briefly on documentary films with the GPO Film Unit writing his famous verse commentary for Night Mail and lyrics for other films that were among his attempts in the 1930s to create a widely accessible socially conscious art. In 1936 Audens publisher chose the title Look Stranger for a collection of political odes love poems comic songs meditative lyrics and a variety of intellectually intense but emotionally accessible verse; Auden hated the title and retitled the collection for the 1937 US edition On This Island. Among the poems included in the book are Hearing of harvests Out on the lawn I lie in bed O what is that sound Look stranger on this island now and Our hunting fathers. Auden was now arguing that an artist should be a kind of journalist and he put this view into practice in Letters from Iceland a travel book in prose and verse written with Louis MacNeice which included his long social literary and autobiographical commentary Letter to Lord Byron. In 1937 after observing the Spanish Civil War he wrote a politically engaged pamphlet poem Spain ; he later discarded it from his collected works. Journey to a War a travel book in prose and verse was written with Isherwood after their visit to the Sino-Japanese War. Audens last collaboration with Isherwood was their third play On the Frontier an anti-war satire written in Broadway and West End styles. Audens shorter poems now engaged with the fragility and transience of personal love a subject he treated with ironic wit in his Four Cabaret Songs for Miss Hedli Anderson and also the corrupting effect of public and official culture on individual lives . In 1938 he wrote a series of dark ironic ballads about individual failure . All these appeared in Another Time together with poems including Dover As He Is and Musée des Beaux Arts and In Memory of W. B. Yeats The Unknown Citizen Law Like Love September 1 1939 and In Memory of Sigmund Freud . The elegies for Yeats and Freud are partly anti-heroic statements in which great deeds are performed not by unique geniuses whom others cannot hope to imitate but by otherwise ordinary individuals who were silly like us or of whom it could be said he wasnt clever at all and who became teachers of others not awe-inspiring heroes. In 1940 Auden wrote a long philosophical poem New Year Letter which appeared with miscellaneous notes and other poems in The Double Man . At the time of his return to the Anglican Communion he began writing abstract verse on theological themes such as Canzone and Kairos and Logos. Around 1942 as he became more comfortable with religious themes his verse became more open and relaxed and he increasingly used the syllabic verse he had learned from the poetry of Marianne Moore. Audens work in this era addresses the artists temptation to use other persons as material for his art rather than valuing them for themselves and the corresponding moral obligation to make and keep commitments while recognising the temptation to break them . From 1942 through 1947 he worked mostly on three long poems in dramatic form each differing from the others in form and content For the Time Being A Christmas Oratorio The Sea and the Mirror A Commentary on Shakespeares The Tempest and The Age of Anxiety A Baroque Eclogue . The first two with Audens other new poems from 1940 to 1944 were included in his first collected edition The Collected Poetry of W.H. Auden with most of his earlier poems many in revised versions. After completing The Age of Anxiety in 1946 he focused again on shorter poems notably A Walk After Dark The Love Feast and The Fall of Rome. Many of these evoked the Italian village where he spent his summers between 1948 and 1957 and his next book Nones had a Mediterranean atmosphere new to his work. A new theme was the sacred importance of the human body in its ordinary aspect and the continuity with nature that the body made possible ; his poems on these themes included In Praise of Limestone and Memorial for the City . In 1949 Auden and Kallman wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinskys opera The Rakes Progress and later collaborated on two libretti for operas by Hans Werner Henze. Audens first separate prose book was The Enchafèd Flood The Romantic Iconography of the Sea based on a series of lectures on the image of the sea in romantic literature. Between 1949 and 1954 he worked on a sequence of seven Good Friday poems titled Horae Canonicae an encyclopaedic survey of geological biological cultural and personal history focused on the irreversible act of murder; the poem was also a study in cyclical and linear ideas of time. While writing this he also wrote Bucolics a sequence of seven poems about mans relation to nature. Both sequences appeared in his next book The Shield of Achilles with other short poems including the books title poem Fleet Visit and Epitaph for the Unknown Soldier. In 195556 Auden wrote a group of poems about history the term he used to mean the set of unique events made by human choices as opposed to nature the set of involuntary events created by natural processes statistics and anonymous forces such as crowds. These poems included T the Great The Maker and the title poem of his next collection Homage to Clio . In the late 1950s Audens style became less rhetorical while its range of styles increased. In 1958 having moved his summer home from Italy to Austria he wrote Good-bye to the Mezzogiorno; other poems from this period include Dichtung und Wahrheit An Unwritten Poem a prose poem about the relation between love and personal and poetic language and the contrasting Dame Kind about the anonymous impersonal reproductive instinct. These and other poems including his 195566 poems about history appeared in Homage to Clio . His prose book The Dyers Hand gathered many of the lectures he gave in Oxford as Professor of Poetry in 195661 together with revised versions of essays and notes written since the mid-1940s. Among the new styles and forms in Audens later work were the haiku and tanka that he began writing after translating the haiku and other verse in Dag Hammarskjölds Markings. A sequence of fifteen poems about his house in Austria Thanksgiving for a Habitat appeared in About the House together with other poems that included his reflection on his lecture tours On the Circuit. In the late 1960s he wrote some of his most vigorous poems including River Profile and two poems that looked back over his life Prologue at Sixty and Forty Years On. All these appeared in City Without Walls . His lifelong passion for Icelandic legend culminated in his verse translation of The Elder Edda . Among his later themes was the religionless Christianity he learned partly from Dietrich Bonhoeffer the dedicatee of his poem Fridays Child. A Certain World A Commonplace Book was a kind of self-portrait made up of favourite quotations with commentary arranged in alphabetical order by subject. His last prose book was a selection of essays and reviews Forewords and Afterwords . His last books of verse Epistle to a Godson and the unfinished Thank You Fog include reflective poems about language philosophy and science and his own aging . His last completed poem was Archaeology about ritual and timelessness two recurring themes in his later years. Audens stature in modern literature has been contested. Probably the most common critical view from the 1930s onward ranked him as the last and least of the three major twentieth-century British and Irish poetsbehind Yeats and Eliotwhile a minority view more prominent in recent years ranks him as the highest of the three. Opinions have ranged from those of Hugh MacDiarmid who called him a complete wash-out; F. R. Leavis who wrote that Audens ironic style was self-defensive self-indulgent or merely irresponsible; and Harold Bloom who wrote Close thy Auden open thy Stevens to the obituarist in The Times who wrote W.H. Auden for long the enfant terrible of English poetry emerges as its undisputed master.Joseph Brodsky wrote that Auden had the greatest mind of the twentieth century. Critical estimates were divided from the start. Reviewing Audens first book Poems Naomi Mitchison wrote If this is really only the beginning we have perhaps a master to look forward to. But John Sparrow recalling Mitchisons comment in 1934 dismissed Audens early work as a monument to the misguided aims that prevail among contemporary poets and the fact that he is being hailed as a master shows how criticism is helping poetry on the downward path. Audens clipped satiric and ironic style in the 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as Charles Madge who wrote in a poem there waited for me in the summer morning Auden fiercely. I read shuddered and knew. He was widely described as the leader of an Auden group that comprised his friends Stephen Spender Cecil Day-Lewis and Louis MacNeice. The four were mocked by the poet Roy Campbell as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named Macspaunday. Audens propagandistic poetic plays including The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent of F6 and his political poems such as Spain gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions such as that of Austin Clarke who called Audens work liberal democratic and humane and John Drummond who wrote that Auden misused a characteristic and popularizing trick the generalized image to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact confined to bourgeois experience. Audens departure for America in 1939 was debated in Britain with some seeing his emigration as a betrayal. Defenders of Auden such as Geoffrey Grigson in an introduction to a 1949 anthology of modern poetry wrote that Auden arches over all. His stature was suggested by book titles such as Auden and After by Francis Scarfe and The Auden Generation by Samuel Hynes . In the US starting in the late 1930s the detached ironic tone of Audens regular stanzas became influential; John Ashbery recalled that in the 1940s Auden was the modern poet. Audens formal influences were so pervasive in American poetry that the ecstatic style of the Beat Generation was partly a reaction against his influence. From the 1940s through the 1960s many critics lamented that Audens work had declined from its earlier promise; Randall Jarrell wrote a series of essays making a case against Audens later work and Philip Larkins Whats Become of Wystan had a wide impact. The first full-length study of Auden was Richard Hoggarts Auden An Introductory Essay which concluded that Audens work then is a civilising force. It was followed by Joseph Warren Beachs The Making of the Auden Canon a disapproving account of Audens revisions of his earlier work. The first systematic critical account was Monroe K. Spears The Poetry of W.H. Auden The Disenchanted Island written out of the conviction that Audens poetry can offer the reader entertainment instruction intellectual excitement and a prodigal variety of aesthetic pleasures all in a generous abundance that is unique in our time. Auden was one of three candidates recommended by the Nobel Committee to the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1963 and 1965 and six recommended for the 1964 prize. By the time of his death in 1973 he had attained the status of a respected elder statesman and a memorial stone for him was placed in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey in 1974. The Encyclopædia Britannica writes that by the time of Eliots death in 1965 a convincing case could be made for the assertion that Auden was indeed Eliots successor as Eliot had inherited sole claim to supremacy when Yeats died in 1939. With some exceptions British critics tended to treat his early work as his best while American critics tended to favour his middle and later work. Another group of critics and poets has maintained that unlike other modern poets Audens reputation did not decline after his death and the influence of his later writing was especially strong on younger American poets including John Ashbery James Merrill Anthony Hecht and Maxine Kumin. Typical later evaluations describe him as arguably the centurys greatest poet who now clearly seems the greatest poet in English since Tennyson . Public recognition of Audens work sharply increased after his Funeral Blues was read aloud in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral ; subsequently a pamphlet edition of ten of his poems Tell Me the Truth About Love sold more than 275000 copies. An excerpt from his poem As I walked out one evening was recited in the film Before Sunrise . After 11 September 2001 his 1939 poem September 1 1939 was widely circulated and frequently broadcast. Public readings and broadcast tributes in the UK and US in 2007 marked his centenary year. Overall Audens poetry was noted for its stylistic and technical achievement its engagement with politics morals love and religion and its variety in tone form and content. Memorial stones and plaques commemorating Auden include those in Westminster Abbey; at his birthplace at 55 Bootham York; near his home on Lordswood Road Birmingham; in the chapel of Christ Church Oxford; on the site of his apartment at 1 Montague Terrace Brooklyn Heights; at his apartment in 77 St. Marks Place New York ; at the site of his death at Walfischgasse 5 in Vienna; and in the Rainbow Honor Walk in San Francisco. In his house in Kirchstetten his study is open to the public upon request. In 2023 newly declassified UK government files revealed that Auden was considered as a candidate to be the new Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1967 following the death of John Masefield. He was rejected due to having taken American citizenship. The following list includes only the books of poems and essays that Auden prepared during his lifetime; for a more complete list including other works and posthumous editions see W. H. Auden bibliography. In the list below works reprinted in the Complete Works of W.H. Auden are indicated by footnote references.
Louis MacNeice,Frederick Louis MacNeice CBE was an Irish poet and playwright and a member of the Auden Group which also included W. H. Auden Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis. MacNeices body of work was widely appreciated by the public during his lifetime due in part to his relaxed but socially and emotionally aware style. Never as overtly or simplistically political as some of his contemporaries he expressed a humane opposition to totalitarianism as well as an acute awareness of his roots. Louis MacNeice was born in Belfast the youngest son of Rev. John Frederick and Elizabeth Margaret MacNeice. Both were originally from the West of Ireland. MacNeices father an Anglican clergyman would go on to become a bishop in the Church of Ireland and his mother Elizabeth née Cleshan from Ballymaconry Connemara County Galway had been a schoolmistress. The family moved to Carrickfergus County Antrim soon after MacNeices birth. When MacNeice was six his mother was admitted to a Dublin nursing home suffering from severe clinical depression and he did not see her again. She survived uterine cancer but died of tuberculosis in December 1914. MacNeice later described the cause of his mothers death as obscure and blamed his mothers cancer on his own difficult birth. His brother William who had Downs syndrome had been sent to live in an institution in Scotland during his mothers terminal illness. In 1917 his father remarried to Georgina Greer and MacNeices sister Elizabeth was sent to board at a preparatory school at Sherborne England. MacNeice joined her at Sherborne Preparatory School later in the year. MacNeice was generally happy at Sherborne which gave an education concentrating on the Classics and literature . He was an enthusiastic sportsman something which continued when he moved to Marlborough College in 1921 having won a classical scholarship. Marlborough was a less happy place with a hierarchical and sometimes cruel social structure but MacNeices interest in ancient literature and civilisation deepened and expanded to include Egyptian and Norse mythology. In 1922 he was invited to join Marlboroughs secret Society of Amici where he was a contemporary of John Betjeman and Anthony Blunt forming a lifelong friendship with the latter. He also wrote poetry and essays for the school magazines. By the end of his time at the school MacNeice was sharing a study with Blunt and also sharing his aesthetic tastes though not his sexual ones; Blunt said MacNeice was totally irredeemably heterosexual. In November 1925 MacNeice was awarded a postmastership to Merton College Oxford and he left Marlborough in the summer of the following year. He left behind his birth name of Frederick his accent and his fathers faith although he never lost a sense of his Irishness;  It was during his first year as a student at Oxford that MacNeice first met W. H. Auden who had gained a reputation as the universitys foremost poet during the preceding year. Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis were already part of Audens circle but MacNeices closest Oxford friends were John Hilton Christopher Holme and Graham Shepard who had been with him at Marlborough. MacNeice threw himself into the aesthetic culture publishing poetry in literary magazines The Cherwell and Sir Galahad organising candle-lit readings of Shelley and Marlowe and visiting Paris with Hilton. Auden would become a lifelong friend who inspired MacNeice to take up poetry seriously. In 1928 he was introduced to the Classics don John Beazley and his stepdaughter Mary Ezra. A year later he thought to soften the news that he had been arrested for drunkenness by telegraphing his father to say he was engaged to be married to Mary. John MacNeice was horrified to discover his son was engaged to a Jew while Ezras family demanded assurances that Louiss brothers Downs syndrome was not hereditary. Amidst this turmoil MacNeice published four poems in Oxford Poetry 1929 and his first undergraduate collection Blind Fireworks . Published by Gollancz the volume was dedicated to Giovanna . In 1930 the couple were married at Oxford Register Office neither set of parents attending the ceremony. He was awarded a first-class degree in literae humaniores and had already gained an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Birmingham. The newlyweds were found lodgings in Birmingham by E. R. Dodds and his wife Bet. Bet was a lecturer in the Department of English. The MacNeices lived in a former coachmans cottage in the grounds of a house in Selly Park belonging to another professor Philip Sargant Florence. Birmingham was a very different university from Oxford MacNeice was not a natural lecturer and he found it difficult to write poetry. He turned instead to a semi-autobiographical novel Roundabout Way which was published in 1932 under the name of Louis Malone as he feared a novel by an academic would not be favourably reviewed. He felt that married life was not helping his poetry To write poems expressing doubt or melancholy an anarchist conception of freedom or nostalgia for the open spaces seemed disloyal to Mariette. Instead I was disloyal to myself wrote a novel which purported to be an idyll of domestic felicity. As we predicted the novel was not well received. The local Classical Association included George Augustus Auden Professor of Public Health and father of W. H. Auden and by 1932 MacNeice and Audens Oxford acquaintance had turned into a close friendship. Auden knew many Marxists and Blunt had also become a communist by this time but MacNeice although sympathetic to the left was always sceptical of easy answers and the armchair reformist. The Strings are False describes his wish for a change in society and even revolution but also his intellectual opposition to Marxism and especially the communism embraced by many of his friends. MacNeice started to write poetry again and in January 1933 he and Auden led the first edition of Geoffrey Grigsons magazine New Verse. MacNeice also started sending poems to T. S. Eliot at around this time and although Eliot did not feel that they merited Faber and Faber publishing a volume of poems several were published in Eliots journal The Criterion. On 15 May 1934 Louis and Marys son Daniel John MacNeice was born. In September of that year MacNeice travelled to Dublin with Dodds who had republican sympathies and met William Butler Yeats. Unsuccessful attempts at playwriting and another novel were followed in September 1935 by Poems the first of his collections for Faber and Faber who would remain his publishers. This helped establish MacNeice as one of the new poets of the 1930s. In November Mary left MacNeice and their infant son for a Russian-American graduate student called Charles Katzmann who had been staying with the family. MacNeice engaged a nurse to look after Dan and his sister and stepmother also helped on occasion. In early 1936 Blunt and MacNeice visited Spain shortly after the election of the Popular Front government. Auden and MacNeice travelled to Iceland in the summer of that year which resulted in Letters from Iceland a collection of poems letters and essays. In October MacNeice left Birmingham for a lecturing post in the Department of Greek at Bedford College for Women part of the University of London. MacNeice was featured in two high-profile collections of modernist poetry of 1936. The Faber Book of Modern Verse edited by young writer and critic Michael Roberts printing MacNeices An Eclogue for Christmas Sunday Morning Perseus The Creditor and Snow towards the end of the roughly chronological book. In the book MacNeice is set in amongst others of the new Auden Group presenting a version of modernism in which Eliot is the star. MacNeice and his group were also featured in Oxford Book of Modern Verse 18921935 edited by Yeats. This collection generally excluded American poets and was less well received critically but instantaneously became a best-seller. MacNeice moved into Geoffrey Grigsons former flat in Hampstead with Daniel and his nurse. His translation of Aeschyluss Agamemnon was published in late 1936 and produced by the Group Theatre. Shortly afterwards his divorce from Mary was finalised. They continued to write frequent affectionate letters to one another although Mary married Katzmann shortly after the divorce. MacNeice started an affair with Nancy Coldstream. Nancy was like her husband Bill a painter and a friend of Auden who had introduced the couple to MacNeice while they were in Birmingham. MacNeice and Nancy visited the Hebrides in 1937 which resulted in a book of prose and verse written by MacNeice with illustrations by Nancy I Crossed the Minch. Nancy had painted a portrait of MacNeice. August 1937 saw the appearance of Letters from Iceland and towards the end of the year a play called Out of the Picture was published and produced by the Group Theatre. Music was written for the production by Benjamin Britten as he had done previously for Agamemnon. In 1938 Faber and Faber published a second collection of poems The Earth Compels the Oxford University Press published Modern Poetry and Nancy once again contributed illustrations to a book about London Zoo called simply Zoo. As the year and his relationship with Nancy drew to a close he started work on Autumn Journal. By Christmas Nancy was in love with Stephen Spenders brother Michael whom she was later to marry and at the end of the year MacNeice visited Barcelona shortly before the city fell to Franco. The poem was finished by February 1939 and published in May. It is widely viewed as MacNeices masterpiece recording his feelings as the Spanish Civil War raged and the United Kingdom headed towards war with Germany as well as his personal concerns and reflections over the past decade. During the Easter holiday that year MacNeice made a brief lecture tour of various American universities also meeting Mary and Charles Katzmann and giving a reading with Auden and Christopher Isherwood in New York attended by John Berryman and at which Auden met Chester Kallman for the first time. MacNeice also met the writer Eleanor Clark in New York and arranged to spend the next academic year on sabbatical so that he could be with her. A lectureship at Cornell University was organised and in December 1939 MacNeice sailed for America leaving his son in Ireland. Cornell proved a success but the relationship with Eleanor did not and MacNeice was back in London by the end of 1940. Faber and Faber published Selected Poems in March 1940 which contained 20 poems drawn from Poems 1935 The Earth Compels and Autumn Journal. It went through six impressions by 1945. MacNeice worked as a freelance journalist and was awaiting the publication of Plant and Phantom which was dedicated to Clark . In early 1941 MacNeice was employed by the BBC. MacNeices work for the BBC initially involved writing and producing radio programmes intended to build support for the US and later Russia cultural programmes emphasising links between the countries rather than outright propaganda. A critical work on W. B. Yeats was published early in 1941 as were Plant and Phantom and Poems 19251940 . At the end of the year MacNeice started a relationship with Hedli Anderson and they were married in July 1942 three months after the death of his father. Brigid Corinna MacNeice was born a year later. By the end of the war MacNeice had written well over sixty scripts for the BBC and a further collection of poems Springboard. The radio play Christopher Columbus produced in 1942 and later published as a book featured music by William Walton conducted by Adrian Boult and starred Laurence Olivier. 1943s He Had a Date was also published as was The Dark Tower . Dylan Thomas acted in some of MacNeices plays during this period and the two poets both heavy drinkers also became social companions. MacNeice narrated the 1945 film Painted Boats. In 1947 the BBC sent MacNeice to report on Indian independence and partition and he continued to produce plays for the corporation including a six-part radio adaptation of Goethes Faust in 1949. 1948s collection of poems Holes in the Sky met with a less favourable reception than previous books. In 1950 he was given eighteen months leave to become Director of the British Institute in Athens run by the British Council.Patrick Leigh Fermor had previously been Deputy Director of the Institute and he and his future wife the Honourable Joan Elizabeth Rayner became close friends of the MacNeices. Ten Burnt Offerings poems written in Greece were broadcast by the BBC in 1951 and published the following year. The family returned to England in August 1951 and Dan left for America in early 1952 to stay with his mother to avoid national service. Dan would return to England in 1953 but went to live permanently with his mother after a legal battle with MacNeice. In 1953 MacNeice wrote Autumn Sequel a long autobiographical poem in terza rima which critics compared unfavourably with Autumn Journal. The death of Dylan Thomas came partway through the writing of the poem and MacNeice involved himself in memorials for the poet and attempts to raise money for his family. 1953 and 1954 brought lecture and performance tours of the USA and meetings with John Berryman and Eleanor Clark . MacNeice travelled to Egypt in 1955 and Ghana in 1956 on lengthy assignments for the BBC. Another poorly received collection of poems Visitations was published in 1957 and the MacNeices bought a holiday home on the Isle of Wight from J. B. Priestley . However the marriage was starting to become strained. MacNeice was drinking increasingly heavily and having more or less serious affairs with other women. At this time MacNeice became increasingly independent of spirit spending time with other writers including Dominic Behan with whom he regularly drank to oblivion; the two men spent a particularly drunken night in the home of Cecil Woodham-Smith during a curious meeting in Ireland whilst Behan was working on assignment as a writer for Life magazine and MacNeice on assignment with the BBC. During the trip which allegedly lasted some weeks neither writer managed successfully to file their copy. MacNeice was awarded the CBE in the 1958 New Years Honours list. A South African trip in 1959 was followed by the start of his final relationship with the actress Mary Wimbush who had performed in his plays since the forties. Hedli asked MacNeice to leave the family home in late 1960. In early 1961 Solstices was published and in the middle of the year MacNeice became a half-time employee at the BBC leaving him six months a year to work on his own projects. By this time he was living on alcohol and eating very little but still writing . In August 1963 he went caving in Yorkshire to gather sound effects for his final radio play Persons from Porlock. Caught in a storm on the moors he did not change out of his wet clothes until he was home in Hertfordshire. Bronchitis evolved into viral pneumonia and he was admitted to hospital in London on 27 August dying there on 3 September aged 55. His ashes were buried in Carrowdore churchyard in County Down with his mother and maternal grandfather. His final book of poems The Burning Perch was published a few days after his funeral Auden who gave a reading at MacNeices memorial service described the poems of his last two years as among his very best. MacNeice wrote in the introduction to his Autumn Journal Poetry in my opinion must be honest before anything else and I refuse to be objective or clear-cut at the cost of honesty. He has inspired many poets since his death particularly those from Northern Ireland such as Paul Muldoon and Michael Longley. There has been a movement to reclaim him as an Irish writer rather than a satellite of Auden. Longley has edited two selections of his work and Muldoon gives more space to MacNeice than to any other author in his Faber Book of Contemporary Irish Poetry which covers the period from the death of W. B. Yeats until 1986. Muldoon and Derek Mahon have both written elegies for MacNeice Mahons coming after a pilgrimage to the poets grave in the company of Longley and Seamus Heaney in 1965. At the time of MacNeices death John Berryman described him as one of my best friends and wrote an elegy in Dream Song 267. Louis MacNeices archive was established at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 1964 a year after MacNeices death. The collection largely coming from MacNeices sister Elizabeth Nicholson includes manuscripts of poetic and dramatic works a large number of books correspondence and books from MacNeices library. MacNeice also wrote several plays which were never produced and many for the BBC which were never published.
Cecil Day-Lewis,Cecil Day-Lewis CBE often written as C. Day-Lewis was an Anglo-Irish poet and Poet Laureate from 1968 until his death in 1972. He also wrote mystery stories under the pseudonym of Nicholas Blake most of which feature the fictional detective Nigel Strangeways. During World War II Day-Lewis worked as a publications editor in the Ministry of Information for the U.K. government and also served in the Musbury branch of the British Home Guard. He is the father of actor Sir Daniel Day-Lewis and documentary filmmaker and television chef Tamasin Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis was born in 1904 in Ballintubbert AthyStradbally border Queens County Ireland. He was the son of Frank Day-Lewis a Church of Ireland rector of that parish and Kathleen Blake . Some of his family were from England and the family had originally been from Berkhamstead in Hertfordshire and have settled in Ireland in the late 1860s. His father took the surname Day-Lewis as a combination of his own birth fathers and adoptive fathers surnames. In his autobiography The Buried Day Day-Lewis wrote As a writer I do not use the hyphen in my surname a piece of inverted snobbery which has produced rather mixed results. IS IT FAR TO GOIs it far to goA step no further.Is it hard to goAsk the melting snowThe eddying feather.What can I take thereNot a hank not a hair.What shall I leave behindAsk the hastening windThe fainting star.Shall I be gone longFor ever and a day.To whom there belongAsk the stone to sayAsk my song.Who will say farewellThe beating bell.Will anyone miss meThat I dare not tell Quick Rose and kiss me. After the death of his mother in 1906 when he was two years old Cecil was brought up in London by his father with the help of an aunt spending summer holidays with relatives in County Wexford. He was educated at Sherborne School and at Wadham College Oxford. In Oxford Day-Lewis became part of the circle gathered around W. H. Auden and helped him to edit Oxford Poetry 1927. His first collection of poems Beechen Vigil appeared in 1925. In 1928 Day-Lewis married Constance Mary King the daughter of a Sherborne teacher. Day-Lewis worked as a schoolmaster in three schools including Larchfield School Helensburgh Scotland . During the 1940s he had a long and troubled love affair with the novelist Rosamond Lehmann. His first marriage was dissolved in 1951 and he married actress Jill Balcon daughter of Michael Balcon. Day-Lewis met Jill at the recording of a radio programme in 1948 and began a relationship with her that year despite being married to Mary. He continued simultaneous relationships with his married wife Mary who lived with their two sons in Dorset unmarried mistress Lehmann who lived in Oxfordshire and Jill who was his latest love. Day-Lewis eventually broke with both his wife and his mistress in order to be with Jill. But he was no more faithful to Jill than he had been with Mary or Rosamond. Jills father was deeply unhappy about the scandalous affair since Jill was named publicly as co-respondent in Day-Lewis divorce. He disinherited Jill and cut off all relationships with her and Day-Lewis. During the Second World War he worked as a publications editor in the Ministry of Information an institution satirised by George Orwell in his dystopian Nineteen Eighty-Four but equally based on Orwells experience of the BBC. During the Second World War his work was less influenced by Auden and he was developing a more traditional style of lyricism. Some critics believe that he reached his full stature as a poet in Word Over All when he finally distanced himself from Auden. After the war he joined the publisher Chatto Windus as a director and senior editor. In 1946 Day-Lewis was a lecturer at Cambridge University publishing his lectures in The Poetic Image . Day-Lewis became a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 1950 Birthday Honours. He later taught poetry at Oxford where he was Professor of Poetry from 1951 to 1956. During 19621963 he was the Norton Professor at Harvard University. Day-Lewis was appointed Poet Laureate in 1968 in succession to John Masefield. His appointment came after appointments secretary John Hewitt consulted with Dame Helen Gardner the Merton Professor of English at the University of Oxford and Geoffrey Handley-Taylor chair of the Poetry Society . Day-Lewis was chairman of the Arts Council Literature Panel vice-president of the Royal Society of Literature an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters a Member of the Irish Academy of Letters and a Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College London. Cecil Day-Lewis died from pancreatic cancer on 22 May 1972 aged 68 at Lemmons the Hertfordshire home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard where he and his family were staying. As a great admirer of Thomas Hardy he arranged to be buried near the authors grave at St Michaels Church in Stinsford Dorset. Day-Lewis was the father of four children. His first two children with Constance Mary King were Sean Day-Lewis a TV critic and writer and Nicholas Day-Lewis who became an engineer. His children with Balcon were Tamasin Day-Lewis a television chef and food critic and Daniel Day-Lewis who became an award-winning actor. Sean Day-Lewis wrote a biography of his father C. Day-Lewis An English Literary Life . Daniel Day-Lewis donated his fathers archive of poetry to the Bodleian Library. In 1935 Day-Lewis decided to increase his income from poetry by writing a detective novel A Question of Proof under the pseudonym Nicholas Blake. He created Nigel Strangeways an amateur investigator and gentleman detective who as the nephew of an Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard has access to official crime investigations. He published nineteen further crime novels. From the mid-1930s Day-Lewis was able to earn his living by writing. Four of the Blake novels A Tangled Web A Penknife in My Heart The Deadly Joker The Private Wound do not feature Strangeways. Minute for Murder is set against the background of Day-Lewiss Second World War experiences in the Ministry of Information. Head of a Traveller features as a principal character a well-known poet frustrated and suffering writers block whose best poetic days are long behind him. Readers and critics have speculated whether the author is describing himself or one of his colleagues or has entirely invented the character. In his youth and during the disruption and suffering of the Great Depression Day-Lewis adopted communist views becoming a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain from 1935 to 1938. His early poetry was marked by didacticism and a preoccupation with social themes. In 1937 he edited The Mind in Chains Socialism and the Cultural Revolution. In the introduction he supported a popular front against a Capitalism that has no further use for culture. He explains that the title refers to Prometheus bound by his chains quotes Shelleys preface to Prometheus Unbound and says the contributors believe that the Promethean fire of enlightenment which should be given for the benefit of mankind at large is being used at present to stoke up the furnaces of private profit. The contributors were Rex Warner Edward Upward Arthur Calder-Marshall Barbara Nixon Anthony Blunt Alan Bush Charles Madge Alistair Brown J.D. Bernal T.A. Jackson and Edgell Rickword. After the late 1930s which were marked by the widespread purges repression and executions under Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union Day-Lewis gradually became disillusioned with communism. In his autobiography The Buried Day he renounces former communist views. His detective novel The Sad Variety contains a scathing portrayal of doctrinaire communists the Soviet Unions repression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising and the ruthless tactics of Soviet intelligence agents.
Stephen Spender,Sir Stephen Harold Spender CBE was an English poet novelist and essayist whose work concentrated on themes of social injustice and the class struggle. He was appointed U.S. Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1965. Spender was born in Kensington London to journalist Harold Spender and Violet Hilda Schuster a painter and poet of German Jewish heritage. He went first to Hall School in Hampstead and then at 13 to Greshams School Holt and later Charlecote School in Worthing but he was unhappy there. On the death of his mother he was transferred to University College School which he later described as that gentlest of schools. Spender left for Nantes and Lausanne and then went up to University College Oxford . Spender said at various times throughout his life that he never passed any exam. Perhaps his closest friend and the man who had the biggest influence on him was W. H. Auden who introduced him to Christopher Isherwood. Spender handprinted the earliest version of Audens Poems. He left Oxford without taking a degree and in 1929 moved to Hamburg. Isherwood invited him to Berlin. Every six months Spender went back to England. Spender was acquainted with fellow Auden Group members Louis MacNeice Edward Upward and Cecil Day-Lewis. He was friendly with David Jones and later came to know William Butler Yeats Allen Ginsberg Ted Hughes Joseph Brodsky Isaiah Berlin Mary McCarthy Roy Campbell Raymond Chandler Dylan Thomas Jean-Paul Sartre Colin Wilson Aleister Crowley F. T. Prince and T. S. Eliot as well as members of the Bloomsbury Group particularly Virginia Woolf. Spender began work on a novel in 1929 which was not published until 1988 under the title The Temple. The novel is about a young man who travels to Germany and finds a culture at once more open than Englands particularly about relationships between men and shows frightening harbingers of Nazism that are confusingly related to the very openness the man admires. Spender wrote in his 1988 introduction In the late Twenties young English writers were more concerned with censorship than with politics.... 1929 was the last year of that strange Indian Summerthe Weimar Republic. For many of my friends and for myself Germany seemed a paradise where there was no censorship and young Germans enjoyed extraordinary freedom in their lives Spender was discovered by T. S. Eliot an editor at Faber and Faber in 1933. His early poetry notably Poems was often inspired by social protest. Living in Vienna he further expressed his convictions in Forward from Liberalism; in Vienna a long poem in praise of the 1934 uprising of Austrian socialists; and in Trial of a Judge an antifascist drama in verse. At the Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris which published the first edition of James Joyces Ulysses historic figures made rare appearances to read their work Paul Valéry André Gide and Eliot. Hemingway even broke his rule of not reading in public if Spender would read with him. Since Spender agreed Hemingway appeared for a rare reading in public with him. In 1936 Spender became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Harry Pollitt its head invited him to write for the Daily Worker on the Moscow Trials. In late 1936 Spender married Inez Pearn whom he had recently met at an Aid to Spain meeting. She was described as small and rather ironic and strikingly good-looking. In 1937 during the Spanish Civil War the Daily Worker sent Spender to Spain on a mission to observe and report on the Soviet ship Komsomol which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the Second Spanish Republic. He travelled to Tangier and tried to enter Spain via Cadiz but was sent back. He then travelled to Valencia where he met Hemingway and Manuel Altolaguirre.  In July 1937 Spender attended the Second International Writers Congress the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war held in Valencia Barcelona and Madrid and attended by many writers including Hemingway André Malraux and Pablo Neruda. Pollitt told Spender to go and get killed; we need a Byron in the movement. Spender was imprisoned for a while in Albacete. In Madrid he met Malraux; they discussed Gides Retour de lU.R.S.S.. Because of medical problems he went back to England and bought a house in Lavenham. In 1939 he divorced. Spenders 1938 translations of works by Bertolt Brecht and Miguel Hernández appeared in John Lehmanns New Writing. Spender felt close to the Jewish people; his mother Violet Hilda Schuster was half-Jewish . His second wife Natasha whom he married in 1941 was also Jewish. In 1942 he joined the fire brigade of Cricklewood and Maresfield Gardens as a volunteer. Spender met several times with the poet Edwin Muir. After he was no longer left-wing Spender wrote of his disillusionment with communism in the essay collection The God that Failed along with Arthur Koestler and others. It is thought that one of the big areas of disappointment was the MolotovRibbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union which many leftists saw as a betrayal. Like Auden Isherwood and several other outspoken opponents of fascism in the 1930s Spender did not see active military service in World War II. He was initially graded C upon examination because of his earlier colitis poor eyesight varicose veins and the long-term effects of a tapeworm in 1934. But he pulled strings to be reexamined and was upgraded to B which meant he could serve in the London Auxiliary Fire Service. Spender spent the winter of 1940 teaching at Blundells School taking a position that had been vacated by Manning Clark who returned to Australia as a consequence of the war to teach at Geelong Grammar. After the war Spender was a member of the Allied Control Commission restoring civil authority in Germany. With Cyril Connolly and Peter Watson Spender co-founded Horizon magazine and served as its editor from 1939 to 1941. From 1947 to 1949 he went to the US several times and saw Auden and Isherwood. He was the editor of Encounter magazine from 1953 to 1966 but resigned after it emerged that the Congress for Cultural Freedom which published it was covertly funded by the CIA. Spender insisted that he was unaware of the ultimate source of the magazines funds. He taught at various American institutions including University of California at Berkeley and Northwestern University. He accepted the Elliston Chair of Poetry at the University of Cincinnati in 1954. In 1961 he became professor of rhetoric at Gresham College London. Spender helped found the magazine Index on Censorship was involved in the founding of the Poetry Book Society and did work for UNESCO. He was appointed the 17th Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1965. During the late 1960s Spender frequently visited the University of Connecticut which he declared had the most congenial teaching faculty he had encountered in the United States. Gentlemen I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spenders poem. You are men who in your lives fought for life... and left the vivid air signed with your honor. Spender also had profound intellectual workings with the world of art including Picasso. The artist Henry Moore did etchings and lithographs conceived to accompany the work of writers including Charles Baudelaire and Spender. Moores work in that regard also included illustrations of the literature of Dante Gide and Shakespeare. The exhibition was held at The Henry Moore Foundation. Spender collected and befriended artists such as Arp Auerbach Bacon Freud Giacometti Gorky Guston Hockney Moore Morandi Picasso and others. In The Worlds of Stephen Spender the artist Frank Auerbach selected art work by those masters to accompany Spenders poems. Spender wrote China Diary with David Hockney in 1982 published by Thames and Hudson art publishers in London. The Soviet artist Wassily Kandinsky created an etching for Spender Fraternity in 1939. In 1933 Spender fell in love with Tony Hyndman and they lived together from 1935 to 1936. In 1934 Spender had an affair with Muriel Gardiner. In a letter to Christopher Isherwood in September 1934 he wrote I find boys much more attractive in fact I am rather more than usually susceptible but actually I find the actual sexual act with women more satisfactory more terrible more disgusting and in fact more everything. In December 1936 shortly after the end of his relationship with Hyndman Spender fell in love with and married Inez Pearn after an engagement of only three weeks. The marriage broke down in 1939. In 1941 Spender married Natasha Litvin a concert pianist. The marriage lasted until his death. Their daughter Elizabeth Spender previously an actor was married to the Australian actor and satirist Barry Humphries until his death in April 2023 and their son Matthew Spender is married to the daughter of the Armenian artist Arshile Gorky. Spenders sexuality has been the subject of debate. His seemingly changing attitudes have caused him to be labelled bisexual repressed latently homophobic or simply something complex that resists easy labelling. Many of his friends in his earlier years were gay. Spender had many affairs with men in his earlier years most notably Hyndman who was called Jimmy Younger in his memoir World Within World. After his affair with Muriel Gardiner he shifted his focus to heterosexuality but his relationship with Hyndman complicated both that relationship and his short-lived marriage to Pearn. His marriage to Litvin in 1941 seems to have marked the end of his romantic relationships with men but not the end of all homosexual activity as his unexpurgated diaries have revealed. Subsequently he toned down homosexual allusions in later editions of his poetry. The following line was revised in a republished edition Whatever happens I shall never be alone. I shall always have a boy a railway fare or a revolution to Whatever happens I shall never be alone. I shall always have an affair a railway fare or a revolution. Nevertheless he was a founding member of the Homosexual Law Reform Society which lobbied for the repeal of British sodomy laws. Spender sued author David Leavitt for allegedly using his relationship with Jimmy Younger in Leavitts While England Sleeps in 1994. The case was settled out of court with Leavitt removing certain portions from his text. On 16 July 1995 Spender died of a heart attack in Westminster London aged 86. He was buried in the graveyard of St Mary on Paddington Green Church in London. The Stephen Spender Trust is a registered charity that was founded to widen the knowledge of 20th-century literature with a particular focus on Spenders circle of writers and to promote literary translation. The trusts activities include poetry readings; academic conferences; a seminar series in partnership with the Institute of English Studies; an archive programme in conjunction with the British Library and the Bodleian; work with schools via Translation Nation; the Guardian Stephen Spender Prize an annual poetry translation prize established in 2004; and the Joseph BrodskyStephen Spender Prize a worldwide RussianEnglish translation competition.
Christopher Isherwood,Christopher William Bradshaw Isherwood was an Anglo-American novelist playwright screenwriter autobiographer and diarist. His best-known works include Goodbye to Berlin a semi-autobiographical novel which inspired the musical Cabaret ; A Single Man adapted as a film by Tom Ford in 2009; and Christopher and His Kind a memoir which carried him into the heart of the Gay Liberation movement. Isherwood was born in 1904 on his familys estate in Cheshire near Stockport in the north-west of England. He was the elder son of Francis Edward Bradshaw Isherwood known as Frank a professional soldier in the York and Lancaster Regiment and Kathleen Bradshaw Isherwood née Machell Smith the only daughter of a successful wine merchant. He was the grandson of John Henry Isherwood squire of Marple Hall and Wyberslegh Hall Cheshire and he included among his ancestors the Puritan judge John Bradshaw who signed the death warrant of King Charles I and served for two years as Lord President of the Council effectively President of the English Republic. Isherwoods father Frank was educated at the University of Cambridge and Sandhurst Military Academy fought in the Boer War and was killed in the First World War. Isherwoods mother Kathleen was through her own mother a member of the wealthy Greene brewing family of Greene King and Isherwood was a cousin of the novelist Graham Greene who was also related to the brewing family. Frank and Kathleen christened their first son Christopher William Bradshaw Isherwood which Isherwood simplified on becoming a United States citizen in 1946. At Repton his boarding school in Derbyshire Isherwood met his lifelong friend Edward Upward with whom he invented an imaginary English village called Mortmere as related in his fictional autobiography Lions and Shadows . He went up to Corpus Christi College Cambridge as a history scholar wrote jokes and limericks on his second year Tripos and was asked to leave without a degree in 1925. At Christmas 1925 he was reintroduced to a prep school friend W. H. Auden. Through Auden Isherwood met the younger poet Stephen Spender who printed Audens first collection Poems . Upward Isherwood Auden and Spender were identified as the most exciting new literary group in England in the 1930s. Auden dubbed Isherwood the novelist in what came to be known as the Auden Group or Auden Generation. With Cecil Day-Lewis and Louis MacNeice Auden and Spender later attracted the name the MacSpaunday Poets with which Isherwood is also associated. After leaving Cambridge Isherwood worked as a private tutor and later as secretary to a string quartet led by the violinist André Mangeot while he completed his first novel. This was All the Conspirators published in 1928 about the struggle for self-determination between children and their parents. In October 1928 Isherwood enrolled as a medical student at Kings College London but he left after six months. In March 1929 Isherwood joined Auden in Berlin where Auden was spending a post-graduate year. The ten-day visit changed Isherwoods life. He began an affair with a German boy met at a cellar bar called The Cosy Corner and he was brought face to face with his tribe at Magnus Hirschfelds Institute for Sexual Science. He visited Berlin again in July and moved there in November. In Berlin Isherwood completed his second novel The Memorial about the impact of the First World War on his family and his generation. He also continued his habit of keeping a diary. In his diary he gathered raw material for Mr. Norris Changes Trains inspired by his real-life friendship with Gerald Hamilton and for Goodbye to Berlin his portrait of the city in which Adolf Hitler was rising to powerenabled by poverty unemployment increasing attacks on Jews and Communists and ignored by the defiant hedonism of night life in the cafés bars and brothels. Goodbye to Berlin included stories published in the leftist magazine New Writing and it included Isherwoods 1937 novella Sally Bowles in which he created his most famous character based on a young Englishwoman Jean Ross with whom he briefly shared a flat. In America the Berlin novels were published together as The Berlin Stories in 1945. In 1951 Goodbye to Berlin was adapted for the New York stage by John van Druten using the title I Am a Camera taken from Isherwoods opening paragraphs. The play inspired the hit Broadway musical Cabaret later adapted to film as Cabaret in 1972. In 1932 Isherwood started a relationship with a young German Heinz Neddermeyer. They fled Nazi Germany together in May 1933 traveling initially to Greece. Neddermeyer was refused entry to England in January 1934 launching an odyssey in search of a country where they could settle together. They lived in the Canary Islands Copenhagen Brussels Amsterdam and Sintra Portugal while trying to obtain a new nationality and passport for Neddermeyer. In May 1937 while he and Isherwood were living in Luxembourg Neddermeyer was suddenly expelled into Germany. Neddermeyer was arrested the next day by the Gestapo for draft evasion and reciprocal onanism. Neddermeyer was sentenced to three and a half years of hard labor and military service. He married in 1938 and the couple had one child a son born in 1940. Neddermeyer survived the war and in 1956 sent Isherwood a letter asking for money to help escape East Germany which Isherwood provided. The last known contact between the two men was a note of condolence from Neddermeyer to Isherwood on the death of Isherwoods mother in 1960.  During this period Isherwood returned often to London where he took his first movie-writing job working with Viennese director Berthold Viertel on the film Little Friend . He collaborated with Auden on three plays The Dog Beneath the Skin The Ascent of F6 and On the Frontier all produced by Robert Medley and Rupert Doones Group Theatre. He also worked on Lions and Shadows a fictionalized autobiography of his education both in and out of school in the 1920s. In January 1938 Isherwood and Auden traveled to China to write Journey to a War about the Sino-Japanese conflict. They returned to England the following summer via the United States and decided to emigrate there in January 1939. While living in Hollywood California Isherwood befriended Truman Capote an up-and-coming young writer who would be influenced by Isherwoods Berlin Stories most specifically in the traces of the story Sally Bowles that surface in Capotes famed novella Breakfast at Tiffanys. Isherwood also befriended Dodie Smith a British novelist and playwright who had also moved to California and who became one of the few people to whom Isherwood showed his work in progress. Isherwood considered becoming an American citizen in 1945 but balked at taking an oath that included the statement that he would defend the country. The next year he applied for citizenship and answered questions honestly saying he would accept non-combatant duties like loading ships with food. The fact that he had volunteered for service with the Medical Corps also helped. At the naturalisation ceremony he found he was required to swear to defend the nation and decided to take the oath since he had already stated his objections and reservations. He became an American citizen on 8 November 1946. He began living with the photographer William Bill Caskey. In 1947 the two traveled to South America. Isherwood wrote the prose and Caskey took the photographs for a 1949 book about their journey entitled The Condor and the Cows. On Valentines Day 1953 at the age of 48 he met the teenager Don Bachardy among a group of friends on the beach at Santa Monica. Reports of Bachardys age at the time vary but Bachardy later said At the time I was probably 16. In fact he was 18. Despite the age difference this meeting began a partnership that though interrupted by affairs and separations continued until the end of Isherwoods life. During the early months of their affair Isherwood finishedand Bachardy typedthe novel on which he had worked for some years The World in the Evening . Isherwood also taught a course on modern English literature at Los Angeles State College for several years during the 1950s and early 1960s. The 30-year age difference between Isherwood and Bachardy raised eyebrows at the time with Bachardy in his own words regarded as a sort of child prostitute but the two became a well-known and well-established couple in Southern Californian society with many Hollywood friends. Down There on a Visit a novel published in 1962 comprised four related stories that overlap the period covered in his Berlin stories. In the opinion of many reviewers Isherwoods finest achievement was his 1964 novel A Single Man that depicted a day in the life of George a middle-aged gay Englishman who is a professor at a Los Angeles university. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 2009. During 1964 Isherwood collaborated with American writer Terry Southern on the screenplay for the Tony Richardson film adaptation of The Loved One Evelyn Waughs caustic satire on the American funeral industry. Isherwood and Bachardy lived together in Santa Monica for the rest of Isherwoods life. Isherwood was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1981 and died of the disease on 4 January 1986 at his Santa Monica home aged 81. His body was donated to medical science at UCLA and his ashes were later scattered at sea. Bachardy became a successful artist with an independent reputation and his portraits of the dying Isherwood became well known after Isherwoods death. Gerald Heard had introduced British writer Aldous Huxley to Vedanta and meditation. After migrating to America in 1937 Heard and Huxley became Vedantists attending functions at the Vedanta Society of Southern California under the guidance of founder Swami Prabhavananda a monk of the Ramakrishna Order of India. Both were initiated by the Swami. Heard and Huxley introduced Isherwood to the Swamis Vedanta Society. Over time Isherwood developed a close friendship with Huxley with whom he sometimes collaborated. Isherwood became a dedicated Vedantist himself and was initiated by Prabhavananda his guru. The process of conversion to Vedanta was so intense that Isherwood was unable to write another novel between the years 19391945 while he immersed himself in study of the Vedanta Scriptures even becoming a monk for a time at the Society. For the next 35 years Isherwood collaborated with the Swami on translations of various Vedanta scriptures including the Bhagavad Gita The Song of God writing articles for the Societys journal and occasionally lecturing at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara temples. For many years he would come to the Hollywood temple on Wednesday nights to read the Gospel of Ramakrishna for a half an hour then the Swami would take questions from the devotees. From 1950 to 1978 Isherwood gave 53 lectures at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta Temples. He mentions in his diaries and the book My Guru and His Disciple that he feels unqualified to preach so most of his lectures were readings of papers written by others primarily Swami Vivekananda. There were a few original lectures including Who Is Ramakrishna The Writer and Vedanta and a lecture on Girish Chandra Ghosh a householder disciple of Ramakrishna. Isherwood was also very involved in the production of the bi-monthly journal of the Vedanta Society of Southern California Vedanta and the West. From 1943 to 1945 he was Managing Editor from 1951 to 1962 he was an Editorial Advisor together with Aldous Huxley Gerald Heard and additionally with John van Druten from 1951 to 1958. From 1949 to 1969 he wrote 40 articles for the journal. Isherwoods father Frank Bradshaw-Isherwood was a colonel in the British Army. He was killed during WWI in the Battle of Ypres France in May 1915 at the age of 46. Isherwood was 10 years old at the time. His fathers death ...deeply affected him not only in his perspective of his father and how he would relate to his mother but in his attitude towards the military and war itself. Isherwoods second novel The Memorial published in 1932 describes the impact on a family from the death of the father in WWI. The Memorial was the first of what would become the trademark for Isherwood reflecting his life experience into the plot of a novel. After being asked to leave Cambridge he lived in Berlin and witnessed the rising power of Fascism the Nazi Party and Hitler. Isherwood describes the times in his autobiographical novels The Berlin Stories. In 1933 Isherwood fled Germany with his friend Heinz Neddermeyer seeking asylum for Heinz - who was refused entry to England. Heinz was finally arrested in the May 1937 by the Gestapo for draft evasion and practicing homosexuality. Back in London Isherwoods sympathies were with the left but although the Anti-war movement flourished after WWI it was fractured into opposing ideological groups. Some wanted to join the fight in the Spanish Civil War others wanting to just let the Germans in rather than go to war still others advocated non-violent resistance all of which had the effect of weakening their political power. The fighting in Spain was savage and ...the left tore itself apart with squabbling and paranoia. Veterans came to feel that the idealism of the cause had been exploited and many resented being policed by shadowy Communist enforcers. In 1937 two of the largest peace groups joined forces; the No More War Movement merged into the Peace Pledge Union. The members attested to the following pledge War is a crime against humanity. I renounce war and am therefore determined not to support any kind of war. I am also determined to work for the removal of all causes of war. Some of the leading authors and intellectuals of the time gave speeches and lent their names to the cause including Gerald Heard Aldous Huxley and Bertrand Russell. Inspired by Hemingways reporting from the Spanish Civil War in January 1938 Isherwood and his friend W. H. Auden traveled to China to cover the invasion by Japan and wrote Journey to a War . They returned to England the following summer via the United States and decided to emigrate there in January 1939. At this point Isherwood wasnt clear about his own anti-war beliefs. On the way to America he realized he was a Pacifist as he would be unwilling to kill his friend Heinz Heinz is in the Nazi army. I wouldnt kill Heinz. Therefore I have no right to kill anybody. He had lost his political faith I couldnt repeat the left-wing slogans which I had been repeating throughout the last few years. After moving to California Isherwood sought ...advice from Gerald Heard and Aldous Huxley about becoming a pacifist and like them he became a disciple of the Ramakrishna monk Swami Prabhavananda head of the Vedanta Society of Southern California. He applied for citizenship and registered as a Conscientiousness Objector. In Pennsylvania he worked in a Quaker Hostel helping to settle European Jews who were fleeing the Nazis. In 1944 the translation of the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita The Song of God that the Swami and Isherwood had been working on was published. In the appendix there is an essay by Isherwood titled The Gita and War. There Isherwood explains the Vedantic view of war and duty. The plot of the poem is that the whole of India is drawn into a great battle and on the eve of the fight Arjuna the hero warrior of the epic poem The Mahabharata is taken between the two armies and sees friends family and worthy people on both sides throws down his weapons and says I will not fight. The rest of the book has Lord Krishna Arjunas friend and advisor explaining the nature of duty. It may be for some person at some time it proper to refuse to fight but if the cause is righteous and its your duty as a warrior to fight it would be a moral hazard to refuse. Vedanta and the West was the official publication of the Vedanta Society of Southern California. It offered essays by many of the leading intellectuals of the time and had contributions from Aldous Huxley Gerald Heard Alan Watts J. Krishnamurti W. Somerset Maugham and many others. Isherwood wrote the following articles that appeared in Vedanta and the West In 1945 sixty-eight articles from Vedanta and the West were collected in book form as Vedanta for the Western World. Isherwood edited the selection and provided an introduction and three articles . Other contributors included Aldous Huxley Gerald Heard Swami Prabhavananda Swami Vivekananda and John Van Druten.
Edward Upward,Edward Falaise Upward FRSL was a British novelist and short story writer who prior to his death was believed to be the UKs oldest living author. Initially gaining recognition amongst the Auden Group as a highly imaginative surrealist writer in the 1930s he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain after which his writing shifted towards Marxist realism. His literary career spanned over eighty years. Upward was born on 9 September 1903 in Romford Essex where his father had a doctors surgery. His parents were Harold Arthur Upward who came from a middle-class family on the Isle of Wight and Louisa Isa Upward who had trained as a nurse and tried acting. His mother who had grown up in Wanstead but was of Welsh descent came from a lower-middle-class background but was very class conscious a trait Upward strongly disliked. His siblings were John Mervyn Upward ; Laurence Vaughan Upward who had schizophrenia; and Yolande Isa Upward . Another brother Harold was born in 1907 and died in infancy that same year. His first cousin once removed was the poet and novelist Allen Upward who committed suicide in 1926. In 1917 at the insistence of his mother Upward was sent to Repton School where he became a close friend of Christopher Isherwood in the sixth form. Upwards first published material appeared in the school magazine The Reptonian in February 1920. From 1922 to 1925 he attended Corpus Christi College Cambridge reading History and then English. After the arrival of Isherwood in Cambridge in 1923 the two created the surreal town of Mortmere an obscene parody and repudiation of the various upper-class characters they encountered at the university. Upward was awarded Cambridges Chancellors Medal for English Verse in 1924 for his poem Buddha. Through Isherwood Upward met and befriended W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender; his first meeting with Auden was at a café in Soho in 1927. From January 1926 Upward took up various teaching jobs in a number of locations such as Carbis Bay Worcester Lockerbie Loretto Scarborough and Stowe. In 1932 he became an English master at Alleyns School Dulwich having been recommended by a friend of his brother Mer who was also a schoolmaster and became headmaster of Port Regis School the following year. He remained at Alleyns until his retirement in 1961. In 1931 he began attending meetings of a branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain in Bethnal Green and canvassed for Joe Vaughan the CPGB candidate for Bethnal Green South West in that years general election. In 1932 he joined the party on a probationary basis which was partly self-imposed and travelled to the Soviet Union as part of a delegation that also included Barbara Wootton. He also visited Isherwood and Spender in Berlin. He became a full member of the party in 1934. In 1936 he married Hilda Percival a fellow teacher and CPGB member with whom he had a son and a daughter . During the Second World War the family was evacuated with Upwards school to Cleveleys in Lancashire where Alleyns temporarily merged with the nearby Rossall School. Starting in 1942 Upward and his wife began to be investigated by MI5 in relation to their communist activities. Upward remained committed to internationalism and socialism for the rest of his life although he and Hilda left the CPGB in 1948 believing that it was no longer revolutionary and that its leadership was trying to appease the Labour government. Upwards first novel Journey to the Border was published by the Hogarth Press in 1938. It describes in poetic prose the rebellion of a private tutor against his employer and the menacing world of the 1930s inducing a nightmarish state and concluding with the recognition that he must join the workers movement. After this Upward found it increasingly difficult to write anything and so in 195253 he took a sabbatical year from teaching in order to focus more intently on his writing but this backfired and resulted in a nervous breakdown. During this time he destroyed most of his Mortmere stories from his Cambridge days having concluded that such grotesque and fantastical fiction was inappropriate in a post-Holocaust world. In 1954 Upward began to overcome his creative block and started work on an autobiographical trilogy titled The Spiral Ascent dealing with the struggle of a poet Alan Sebrill to combine his creative endeavours with political commitment to the CPGB. The trilogy was published in the years following Upwards early retirement in 1961 to the house where his parents used to live in Sandown Isle of Wight. In the Thirties the first volume describes Sebrills early involvement with the CPGB and the struggle against the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. The Rotten Elements involves Sebrill and his wifes clash with the party leadership and their decision to leave the party. The final volume No Home but the Struggle sees Sebrill find new meaning by joining the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament which helps him to write again. It also includes largely autobiographical recollections of Upwards family and childhood inspired by Marcel Proust whom Upward greatly admired. In the last decades of the twentieth century Upward returned to writing short stories which were published along with reprints of earlier works by the Enitharmon Press. His last years were also punctuated by sadness with the deaths of his wife Hilda in 1995 and his son Christopher in 2002. In 2003 Enitharmon celebrated his centenary by publishing selected short stories edited by Alan Walker as A Renegade in Springtime. He often gave interviews recalling memories of his famous friends. In an interview with Nicholas Wroe which appeared in The Guardian the month before his hundredth birthday Upward explained that the title came from an idea for a story about Auden. I never wrote the story but the phrase stayed. The renegade is the one with a sense of reality and everyone else is too happy-go-lucky. His last story Crommelin-Brown was written in 2003 shortly before he turned 100. In 2005 Upward was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and awarded its Benson Medal. On 13 February 2009 Upward died of a chest infection at a care home in Pontefract West Yorkshire where he had relocated in 2004 to be close to his daughter. He was 105 years old. Edward Upward Art and Life by Peter Stansky was published in May 2016. There are collections of Upwards literary papers and correspondence in the British Library and in the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College Cambridge.

Rex Warner,Rex Warner was an English classicist writer and translator. He is now probably best remembered for The Aerodrome . Warner was described by V. S. Pritchett as the only outstanding novelist of ideas whom the decade of ideas produced. He was born Reginald Ernest Warner in Birmingham England and brought up mainly in Gloucestershire where his father was a clergyman. He was educated at St. Georges School in Harpenden and at Wadham College Oxford where he associated with W. H. Auden Cecil Day-Lewis and Stephen Spender and published in Oxford Poetry. He obtained a 1st in Classical Moderations in 1925 and later graduated with a 3rd in English in 1928. He then spent time teaching some of it in Egypt. Warners debut story Holiday appeared in the New Statesman in 1930. His first collection Poems appeared in 1937. His poem Arms in Spain a satire on German and Italian support for the Spanish Nationalists has often been reprinted. He was also a contributor to Left Review. Warner was a great admirer of Franz Kafka and his fiction was profoundly influenced by Kafkas work. Warners first three novels all reflect his anti-fascist beliefs; The Wild Goose Chase is in part a dystopian fantasy about the overthrow of a tyrannical government in a heroic revolution. His second novel The Professor published around the time of the Nazi Anschluss is the story of a liberal academic whose compromises with a repressive government lead eventually to his arrest imprisonment and murder while attempting to escape. Contemporary reviewers saw parallels with the Austrian leaders Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg. Although Warner was initially sympathetic to the Soviet Union the MolotovRibbentrop Pact left him disillusioned with Communism.The Aerodrome is an allegorical novel whose young hero is faced with the disintegration of his certainties about his loved ones and with a choice between the earthy animalistic life of his home village and the pure efficient emotionally detached life of an airman.The Times described The Aerodrome as Warners most perfectly accomplished novel.Why Was I Killed is an afterlife fantasy with an anti-war theme. Warner then abandoned contemporary allegory in favour of historical novels about Ancient Greece and Rome including Imperial Caesar for which he was awarded the 1960 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. Imperial Caesar was praised by John Davenport as delightfully perceptive and funny and by Storm Jameson as brilliant intelligent continuously interesting. It has everything.The Converts a novel about Saint Augustine reflected Warners own increasing devotion to Christianity. He dedicated it to the Greek poet and diplomat George Seferis. Warner served in the Home Guard during the Second World War and also worked as a Latin teacher at a Grammar School in Morden as there was a shortage of teachers. From 1945 to 1947 he was in Athens as Director of the British Institute. At that time he became involved in numerous translations of classical Greek and Latin authors. His translation of Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War for Penguin Classics sold over a million copies. He also translated Poems of George Seferis . Warners time in Greece coincided with the early stages of the Greek Civil War which ended with the Greek Communists defeated and suppressed. This formed the background to his book Men of Stones A Melodrama depicting imprisoned leftists presenting King Lear in their prison camp. In 1961 Warner was appointed Tallman Professor of Classics at Bowdoin College and from 1962 to 1973 he was a professor at the University of Connecticut.

My grandfather cut more turf in a dayThan any other man on Toners bog.Once I carried him milk in a bottleCorked sloppily with paper. He straightened upTo drink it then fell to right awayNicking and slicing neatly heaving sodsOver his shoulder going down and downFor the good turf. Digging.The cold smell of potato mould the squelch and slapOf soggy peat the curt cuts of an edgeThrough living roots awaken in my head.But Ive no spade to follow men like them.Between my finger and my thumbThe squat pen rests.Ill dig with it.

Irish poet Paul Muldoon was named recipient of the award that year partly in recognition of the close connection between the two poets. Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995 for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth which exalt everyday miracles and the living past. He was on holiday in Greece with his wife when the news broke. Neither journalists nor his own children could reach him until he arrived at Dublin Airport two days later although an Irish television camera traced him to Kalamata. Asked how he felt to have his name added to the Irish Nobel pantheon of W. B. Yeats George Bernard Shaw and Samuel Beckett Heaney responded Its like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range. You hope you just live up to it. Its extraordinary. He and his wife Marie were immediately taken from the airport to Áras an Uachtaráin for champagne with President Mary Robinson. He would refer to the prize discreetly as the N thing in personal exchanges with others. Heaneys 1996 collection The Spirit Level won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award; he repeated the success in 1999 with Beowulf A New Verse Translation. Heaney was elected a Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1996 and was admitted in 1997. In the same year Heaney was elected Saoi of Aosdána. In 1998 Heaney was elected Honorary Fellow of Trinity College Dublin. In 2000 Heaney was awarded an honorary doctorate and delivered the commencement address at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2002 Heaney was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University and delivered a public lecture on The Guttural Muse. In 2003 the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry was opened at Queens University Belfast. It houses the Heaney Media Archive a record of Heaneys entire oeuvre along with a full catalogue of his radio and television presentations. That same year Heaney decided to lodge a substantial portion of his literary archive at Emory University as a memorial to the work of William M. Chace the universitys recently retired president. The Emory papers represented the largest repository of Heaneys work . He donated these to help build their large existing archive of material from Irish writers including Yeats Paul Muldoon Ciaran Carson Michael Longley and other members of the Belfast Group. In 2003 when asked if there was any figure in popular culture who aroused interest in poetry and lyrics Heaney praised American rap artist Eminem from Detroit saying He has created a sense of what is possible. He has sent a voltage around a generation. He has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy. Heaney wrote the poem Beacons at Bealtaine to mark the 2004 EU Enlargement. He read the poem at a ceremony for the 25 leaders of the enlarged European Union arranged by the Irish EU presidency. In August 2006 Heaney had a stroke. Although he recovered and joked Blessed are the pacemakers when fitted with a heart monitor he cancelled all public engagements for several months. He was in County Donegal at the time of the 75th birthday of Anne Friel wife of playwright Brian Friel. He read the works of Henning Mankell Donna Leon and Robert Harris while in hospital. Among his visitors was former President Bill Clinton. Heaneys District and Circle won the 2006 T. S. Eliot Prize. In 2008 he became artist of honour in Østermarie Denmark and Seamus Heaney Stræde was named after him. In 2009 Heaney was presented with an Honorary-Life Membership award from the University College Dublin Law Society in recognition of his remarkable role as a literary figure. Faber and Faber published Dennis ODriscolls book Stepping Stones Interviews with Seamus Heaney in 2008; this has been described as the nearest thing to an autobiography of Heaney. In 2009 Heaney was awarded the David Cohen Prize for Literature. He recorded a spoken word album over 12 hours long of himself reading his poetry collections to commemorate his 70th birthday which occurred on 13 April 2009. He spoke at the West Belfast Festival in July 2010 in celebration of his mentor the poet and novelist Michael McLaverty who had helped Heaney to first publish his poetry. In September 2010 Faber published Human Chain Heaneys twelfth collection. Human Chain was awarded the Forward Poetry Prize for Best Collection one of the major poetry prizes Heaney had never previously won despite having been twice shortlisted. The book published 44 years after the poets first was inspired in part by Heaneys stroke in 2006 which left him babyish and on the brink. Poet and Forward judge Ruth Padel described the work as a collection of painful honest and delicately weighted poems ... a wonderful and humane achievement. Writer Colm Tóibín described Human Chain as his best single volume for many years and one that contains some of the best poems he has written... is a book of shades and memories of things whispered of journeys into the underworld of elegies and translations of echoes and silences. In October 2010 the collection was shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize. Heaney was named one of Britains top 300 intellectuals by The Observer in 2011 though the newspaper later published a correction acknowledging that several individuals who would not claim to be British had been featured of which Heaney was one. That same year he contributed translations of Old Irish marginalia for Songs of the Scribe an album by Traditional Singer in Residence of the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin. In December 2011 Heaney donated his personal literary notes to the National Library of Ireland. Even though he admitted he would likely have earned a fortune by auctioning them Heaney personally packed up the boxes of notes and drafts and accompanied by his son Michael delivered them to the National Library. In June 2012 Heaney accepted the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetrys Lifetime Recognition Award and gave a speech in honour of the award. Heaney was compiling a collection of his work in anticipation of Selected Poems 19882013 at the time of his death. The selection includes poems and writings from Seeing Things The Spirit Level the translation of Beowulf Electric Light District and Circle and Human Chain . In February 2014 Emory University premiered Seamus Heaney The Music of What Happens the first major exhibition to celebrate the life and work of Seamus Heaney since his death. The exhibit holds a display of the surface of Heaneys personal writing desk that he used in the 1980s as well as old photographs and personal correspondence with other writers.Heaney died in August 2013 during the exhibitions curatorial process. Though the exhibits original vision to celebrate Heaneys life and work remains at the forefront there is a small section commemorating his death and its influence. In September 2015 it was announced that Heaneys family would posthumously publish his translation of Book VI of The Aeneid in 2016. Seamus Heaney died in the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin on 30 August 2013 aged 74 following a short illness. After a fall outside a restaurant in Dublin he entered hospital for a medical procedure but died at 730 the following morning before it took place. His funeral was held in Donnybrook Dublin on the morning of 2 September 2013 and he was buried in the evening at his home village of Bellaghy in the same graveyard as his parents younger brother and other family members. His son Michael revealed at the funeral mass that his father texted his final words Noli timere to his wife Marie minutes before he died. His funeral was broadcast live the following day on RTÉ television and radio and was streamed internationally at RTÉs website. RTÉ Radio 1 Extra transmitted a continuous broadcast from 8 a.m. to 915p.m. on the day of the funeral of his Collected Poems album recorded by Heaney in 2009. His poetry collections sold out rapidly in Irish bookshops immediately following his death. Many tributes were paid to Heaney. President Michael D. Higgins said  President Higgins also appeared live from Áras an Uachtaráin on the Nine OClock News in a five-minute segment in which he paid tribute to Seamus Heaney. Bill Clinton former President of the United States said  Both his stunning work and his life were a gift to the world. His mind heart and his uniquely Irish gift for language made him our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives and a powerful voice for peace...His wonderful work like that of his fellow Irish Nobel Prize winners Shaw Yeats and Beckett will be a lasting gift for all the world. José Manuel Barroso European Commission president said  I am greatly saddened today to learn of the death of Seamus Heaney one of the great European poets of our lifetime. ... The strength beauty and character of his words will endure for generations to come and were rightly recognised with the Nobel Prize for Literature. We are fortunate and proud to have counted Seamus Heaney as a revered member of the Harvard family. For us as for people around the world he epitomised the poet as a wellspring of humane insight and artful imagination subtle wisdom and shining grace. We will remember him with deep affection and admiration. Poet Michael Longley a close friend of Heaney said I feel like Ive lost a brother.Thomas Kinsella said he was shocked but John Montague said he had known for some time that the poet was not well. Playwright Frank McGuinness called Heaney the greatest Irishman of my generation he had no rivals.Colm Tóibín wrote In a time of burnings and bombings Heaney used poetry to offer an alternative world.Gerald Dawe said he was like an older brother who encouraged you to do the best you could do.Theo Dorgan said work will pass into permanence. Everywhere I go there is real shock at this. Seamus was one of us. His publisher Faber and Faber noted that his impact on literary culture is immeasurable. Playwright Tom Stoppard said Seamus never had a sour moment neither in person nor on paper.Andrew Motion a former UK Poet Laureate and friend of Heaney called him a great poet a wonderful writer about poetry and a person of truly exceptional grace and intelligence. Many memorial events were held including a commemoration at Emory University Harvard University Oxford University and the Southbank Centre London. Leading US poetry organisations also met in New York to commemorate the death. In order that human beings bring about the most radiant conditions for themselves to inhabit it is essential that the vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place. The poet who would be most the poet has to attempt an act of writing that outstrips the conditions even as it observes them. At one time Heaneys books made up two-thirds of the sales of living poets in the UK. His work often deals with the local surroundings of Ireland particularly in Northern Ireland where he was born and lived until young adulthood. Speaking of his early life and education he commented I learned that my local County Derry experience which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to the modern world was to be trusted. They taught me that trust and helped me to articulate it.Death of a Naturalist and Door into the Dark mostly focus on the details of rural parochial life. In a number of volumes beginning with Door into the Dark and Wintering Out Heaney also spent a significant amount of time writing on the northern Irish bog. Particularly of note is the collection of bog body poems in North featuring mangled bodies preserved in the bog. In a review by Ciaran Carson he said that the bog poems made Heaney into the laureate of violencea mythmaker an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity. Poems such as Bogland and Bog Queen addressed political struggles directly for the first time. Shaun OConnell in the New Boston Review notes that those who see Seamus Heaney as a symbol of hope in a troubled land are not of course wrong to do so though they may be missing much of the undercutting complexities of his poetry the backwash of ironies which make him as bleak as he is bright. OConnell notes in his Boston Review critique of Station Island  Again and again Heaney pulls back from political purposes; despite its emblems of savagery Station Island lends no rhetorical comfort to Republicanism. Politic about politics Station Island is less about a united Ireland than about a poet seeking religious and aesthetic unity. Heaney is described by critic Terry Eagleton as an enlightened cosmopolitan liberal refusing to be drawn. Eagleton suggests When the political is introduced... it is only in the context of what Heaney will or will not say. Reflections on what Heaney identifies as tribal conflict favour the description of peoples lives and their voices drawing out the psychic landscape. His collections often recall the assassinations of his family members and close friends lynchings and bombings. Colm Tóibín wrote throughout his career there have been poems of simple evocation and description. His refusal to sum up or offer meaning is part of his tact. Heaney published Requiem for the Croppies a poem that commemorates the Irish rebels of 1798 on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented To read Requiem for the Croppies wasnt to say up the IRA or anything. It was silence-breaking rather than rabble-rousing. He stated You dont have to love it. You just have to permit it. He turned down the offer of laureateship of the United Kingdom partly for political reasons commenting Ive nothing against the Queen personally I had lunch at the Palace once upon a time. He stated that his cultural starting point was off-centre. A much-quoted statement was when he objected to being included in The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry . Although he was born in Northern Ireland his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem An Open Letter Dont be surprised if I demur for be advisedMy passports green.No glass of ours was ever raisedTo toast The Queen. Whatever the occasion childhood farm life politics and culture in Northern Ireland other poets past and present Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language examining its genetic structures trying to discover how it has served in all its changes as a culture bearer a world to contain imaginations at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness and a winning impatience with received wisdom. His plays include The Cure at Troy A Version of Sophocles Philoctetes . Heaneys 2004 play The Burial at Thebes suggests parallels between Creon and the foreign policies of the Bush administration. Heaneys engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works The Redress of Poetry and Finders Keepers Selected Prose 19712001 . He continues The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place. Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets and in particular Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz. Heaneys work is used extensively in the school syllabus internationally including the anthologies The Rattle Bag and The School Bag . Originally entitled The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People on the Faber contract Hughes and Heaney decided the main purpose of The Rattle Bag was to offer enjoyment to the reader Arbitrary riches. Heaney commented the book in our heads was something closer to The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement. It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives as well as nonsense rhymes ballad-type poems riddles folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later The School Bag aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted less of a carnival more like a checklist. It included poems in English Irish Welsh Scots and Scots Gaelic together with work reflecting the African-American experience. The Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy is a literary and arts centre which commemorates Heaneys legacy. In 2017 it was announced that following an approach by the writer to the Heaney family Fintan OToole had been authorised to write a biography of the poet with access to family-held records. OToole had been somewhat acquainted with Heaney and Heaney had according to his son admired OTooles work. His literary papers are held by the National Library of Ireland. In November 2019 the documentary Seamus Heaney and the music of what happens was aired on BBC Two. His wife Marie and his children talked about their family life and read some of the poems he wrote for them. For the first time Heaneys four brothers remembered their childhood and the shared experiences that inspired many of his finest poems.
