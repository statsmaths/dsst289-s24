Amy M. Charles’s biography of Herbert is apparently cited as the source of the date of Herbert’s father’s death; it makes no reference to Donne serving as godfather.  The other citation is to a web document by Patrick Moore, which asserts that Donne was Herbert’s godfather but cites no evidence or source for this claim."

Samuel Beckett,William+7,2022-03-22T22:13:27Z,81436,"Beckett rejected Lucia before her diagnosis, and her mental health was never once brought up as reason for rejection. All articles on the subject show that Beckett explained clearly to her that his relationship with her father was the reason for being close to her, and as such, the relationship was without cause for a romantic encounter. The removed explanation was without citation and seems to only be fueled by ableism given the fact no source can be found to corroborate such a claim."
