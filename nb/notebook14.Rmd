## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../funs/funs.R")
```

## What We Eat in America

Today we will continue to look at the *What We Eat in America* dataset. We can
read the tables in with the following:

```{r}
food <- read_csv("../data/wweia_food.csv.bz2")
demo <- read_csv("../data/wweia_demo.csv.bz2")
meta <- read_csv("../data/wweia_meta.csv.bz2")
```

We will try to apply some of the modeling techniques from the notes as we study
more about this data.

### Modelling Alcohol and Age

The data contains information about how much alcohol was in a particular food
item. Create a plot that shows the average amount of alcohol that people of 
a particular age consume within the data. Use the actual ages, not the buckets
that we created in the previous notebook.

```{r, question-01}

```

You should see that there is a strong relationship between age and alcohol
consumption. Let's try to model this relationship. Below, create a new dataset
called `temp` that gives the average daily alcohol consumption by age. Filter
to only include those ages equal or greater than 21 years.

```{r, question-02}

```

Build and save a linear regression model below that predicts alcohol usage
based on age using the data you just created. Print out the output of the 
`tidy` function applied to the data and try to understand what the numbers in
the output mean.

```{r, question-03}

```

Now, reproduce the plot from question one for the ages greater than 21 but add
a linear regression line using the `augment` function. Does the fit seem as you
would expect?

```{r, question-04}

```

Does alcohol consumption differ by gender across ages? Let's create a dataset
named `temp` again, but summarize the data by age and gender. Produce a model
that incorporates different slopes and intercepts for male and female groups
by using the formula `alcohol ~ age * gender`. Print out the output of the
`tidy` function applied to the model.

```{r, question-05}

```

In the code block below, plot the model with `augment`. Be careful here! You'll
need to use the color aesthetic to get this to look correct.

```{r, question-06}

```

There's a shortcut to making the plot above. We can add the following layer onto
a plot:

- `geom_smooth(aes(color = gender), method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x)`

To automatically fit a linear regression for each gender. Using the `temp` 
dataset, plot the points and the output of the `geom_smooth` layer given above.
Verify that this looks the same as the plot you made in the prior question.

```{r, question-07}

```

While ggplot gives us the ability to create this plot quickly, it is not easy
to get access to the other model metrics that our more involved approach in
the previous questions gave us.

### Caffeine

Let's move on to caffeine. Produce a similar plot to the one in question 7 for
caffeine consumption by gender and age. This time, though, use the following 
`geom_smooth` instead:

- `geom_smooth(aes(color = gender), method = "loess", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x)`

This will fit a curve rather than a straight line. You'll see in the plot why
this is needed.

```{r, question-08}

```

You can imagine that caffeine usage changes throughout the day. In the following
code block, summarize the average caffeine consumption by age, gender, and
whether the time is the morning (`time < 12`) or afternoon (`time >= 12`). Use
the `facet_wrap` to produce one plot for the morning and one for the afternoon
measurements. Take note of any interesting patterns!

```{r, question-09}

```

### Model Metrics

Let's create a linear model corresponding to the one you just produce in Q9,
but this time do it by creating a temporary data table and the `lm` function.
The formula should be `gender + age + day_time` (if you called the time of 
day variable you made `day_time`).

```{r, question-10}

```

Use the function `glance` to see the model statistics:

```{r, question-11}

```

The value `r.squared` tells us the proportion of the variation in the data 
explained by the model (it ranges from 0 to 1). How much of the variation in the
data are described by model you built? Does that make sense to you based on the
plot?

**Answer**:
quite a lot for this kind of data. This makes sense from the plot because we 
see that these three variables do have a large effect on caffeine usage but 
that the relationship is not perfectly linear and there is still quite a lot of
noise in the data.
