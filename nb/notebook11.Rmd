## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../funs/funs.R")
```

Today's notebook will be a bit more open-ended in nature than the previous ones
we have worked on. Instead of rushing through the questions by finding an easy
answer, try to think of something interesting to do with the data.

## Shakespeare Plays

The data for today comes from the text of Shakespeare's plays. The main table
consists of one row for each spoken line in every play included in the first
folio. The `globalnumber` gives the line number within the entire play and 
the `speech_id` feature gives a way of referencing a set of contiguous lines
said by one speaker.

```{r, message=FALSE}
lines <- read_csv("../data/shakespeare_lines.csv.bz2")
lines
```

We also have metadata about each of the plays. The dates of the plays are not
known precisely. The variables `year_post_quem` and `year_ante_quem` give the
earliest and latest years that the play was believed to have been written.

```{r, message=FALSE}
plays <- read_csv("../data/shakespeare_plays.csv")
plays
```

We also have a table about the individual characters in each of the plays:

```{r, message=FALSE}
people <- read_csv("../data/shakespeare_people.csv.bz2")
people
```

As well as a collection of stage instructions:

```{r, message=FALSE}
stage <- read_csv("../data/shakespeare_sd.csv.bz2")
stage
```

While these are "real" datasets, I have done some aggressive filtering of the
data to remove some potential issues when working with the data (most notably,
I removed non-ASCII characters used to display some antiquated symbols such as
the long-S). If you want to do a longer research project with this data, I am
happy to share the more complex raw source information.

In each of the section below, I will ask you to use the techniques we have 
developed in class to study a particular question about the dataset. I will
provide possible solutions to each of the questions, but you may approach them
in a very different way.

### Date and genre of the plays

Produce a plot that shows the `year_post_quem` and `year_ante_quem` of each 
play. Try to show any patterns about the mixture of comedies, histories and
tragedies and how Shakespeare's interest across these three types of plays
changed over his lifetime.

```{r, question-01}

```

### Play length

Produce a visualization that shows the length of each play in number of lines.
Again, try to show the relationship between genre and play length.

```{r, question-02}

```

### Narrative Form

Take a single play, perhaps one that you are vaguely familiar with. Visualize
when each character is speaking in the play and show how these lines relate to
the Act of the play. 

```{r, question-03}

```

Can you create a similar plot showing only the N characters that have the most
lines in the play? (You can pick a good N with some experimentation on your own
data).

```{r, question-04}

```

### Characters

Two ways that we can establish the prominence of a character is through the 
number of total lines they have as well as the number of long speech they have.
As a starting point, assuming long speaches are over 20 lines. Produce a
visualization showing the relationship between these two measurements for the
most prolific characters in the dataset. This might take several steps. 

Feel free to adjust the number of characters and the length of a "long speech"
and see how it affects the output.

```{r, question-05}

```

### Character Gender

Visualize the proportion of lines spoken by female characters in each play.

```{r, question-06}

```

Then, use  a `geom_density` layer to show how the proportion of female character
lines changes with genre.

```{r, question-07}

```

### Narrative Arc

Using a set of the characters that have the most overall lines across the data,
visualize the number of lines a character has in the first two acts compared 
their number of lines in acts 4 and 5.

Note that some plays do not have a full five acts (Hamlet) in the folio version
and you may want to remove those from the plot.

```{r, question-08}

```

### Extensions?

If you have time, try to extend one of the plots above with another idea or 
modification of the question I asked as a way of understanding the data.

```{r}

```
