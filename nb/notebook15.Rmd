## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../funs/funs.R")
```

## What We Eat in America

Today we will continue to look at the *What We Eat in America* dataset. We can
read the tables in with the following:

```{r}
food <- read_csv("../data/wweia_food.csv.bz2")
demo <- read_csv("../data/wweia_demo.csv.bz2")
meta <- read_csv("../data/wweia_meta.csv.bz2")
```

We will do some more practice joining and reorganizing the food data, this type
using more of the `meta` table, which we have not yet looked at.

## Food Groups: Calories, Sugar, and Fat

To start, create a dataset that shows the average number of calories that each
participants consumes based on the `food_group` of the food item. The food group
can be found in the `meta` table. Note that the easiest way to do this is to
take the sume of the variable `kcal` and divide by `nrow(demo)` (the number of
people).

```{r, question-01}

```

Now, create a scatterplot with one dot for each food group. The x-coordinate 
should correspond to the average number of calories participants consume from
this group and the y-coordinate should be the average grams of sugar each 
participant consumes from the food group. Add a text repel layer with the
food group names.

```{r, question-02}

```

Below, repeat the previous question but now include a linear regression line.
Do this use the `lm` and `augement` functions (e.g., not with `geom_smooth`).
Take note of any outliers.

```{r, question-03}

```

In the next block of code, repeat the previous question but this time use the
average amount of fat in place of the average amount of sugar. Hint: this should
be an easy change.

```{r, question-04}

```

In the following plot, create a similar plot as you did in the previous question,
but instead of a point for each food group, use a line segment going from the
average values for Female participants towards the averages for Male
participants. You do not need a regression line here. You may need to tweak 
the colors to be able to see all of the food groups.

```{r, question-05}

```

### A More Complex Plot

For the most part, our analyses have been able to get by using a single set of
pipes. Sometimes, more complex analyses require use to modify a dataset in
multiple incompatible ways, storing these as individual tables, and then joining
them on a common key. We'll practice that here.

Our goal is to see how the relationship between the average amount of calories
consumed for breakfast within an age group is related to the average amount of
food that was prepared from ingredients bought at a store.

First, create and save a dataset that breaks the ages in the dataset into buckets
of 5 years each and computes the proportion of calories within each bucket that
were consumed at either Breakfast or Desayano (Spanish for Breakfast). You'll
probably need a pivot for this.

```{r, question-07}

```

In the code block below, create a similar table, but this time we want to
compute the proportion of calories consumed from items bought at a Store. The
names for the `food_source` variable are fairly messy; so as a first step, use
the following mutate function to take just the first 5 characters of the food
source name:

`  mutate(food_source = stri_sub(food_source, 1, 5)) |>`

Then, the rest of the code should be similar to the answer above.

```{r, question-08}

```

Finally, put the two tables you saved from questions 7 and 8 together and plot
the two proportions on the x- and y-axes. Include labels showing the age
buckets. If you have time, try to add a linear regression line and some labels,
title, etc. to the plot.

```{r, question-09}

```
