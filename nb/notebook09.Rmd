## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../funs/funs.R")
```

I have set the options `include=FALSE` and `message=FALSE` to avoid cluttering
the solutions with all the output from this code.

## Flights

### Datasets

In this notebook we are going to work with a number of different data tables
concerning commercial flights that departed from Richmond International Airport
(RIC) in 2019. The data are in five different tables that can be joined together
using different sets of keys. I think most of the variables are
self-explanatory, but please ask if you have any questions! There is a table
of airlines:

```{r}
airlines <- read_csv("../data/flightsrva_airlines.csv.gz")
airlines
```

One of airports:

```{r}
airports <- read_csv("../data/flightsrva_airports.csv.gz")
airports
```

The table of flights:

```{r}
flights <- read_csv("../data/flightsrva_flights.csv.gz") |>
  select(-time_hour) # removing for now until we discuss datetime objects 
flights
```

A table of planes:

```{r}
planes <- read_csv("../data/flightsrva_planes.csv.gz")
planes
```

And a table of weather:

```{r}
weather <- read_csv("../data/flightsrva_weather.csv.gz") |>
  select(-time_hour) # removing for now until we discuss datetime objects 
weather
```

Before you proceed, take a moment to determine what (if any) is the primary
key of each table. 

### Carriers

In the first question, create a barplot showing the number of flights each 
carrier made in 2019 out of RIC. Order the barplot in descending order of the
count of flights. Put the count on the x-axis and the airline on the y-axis.

```{r, question-01}

```

The plot above is tricky because you probably do not know all of the airline
codes. Repeat the plot in the code below, but use a `left_join` to combine the
results with the `airlines` dataset and use the full airline names on the 
y-axis rather than single codes. Do you recognize the carrier with the most
flights out of the city?

```{r, question-02}

```

### Destinations

Now, produce a similar barplot counting the number of outbound flights from RIC
based on where the flight was going to. Put the destination code on the y-axis,
counts on the x-axis, and order in descending order of count.

```{r, question-03}

```

Airport codes are a bit easier to figure out that airline codes, but you 
probably still only know the top few from the previous plot. Modify your plot
above in the code below by joining with the `airports` data and using the full
airport names. Be careful with this; it is slightly more difficult than the
join you did in question 2.

```{r, question-04}

```

The `airports` table has longitude and latitude in addition to the airport
names. Let's create a plot with longitude on the x-axis, latitude on the y-axis,
and a point for each airport that had outbound flights from RIC in 2019. Make
the size of the points scale with the number of flights and add text labels to
give the airport FAA code for each city. Finally, add proper labels to the 
aesthetics and a title.

```{r, question-05}

```

Let's add one more element to the plot above. In the code below, modify the 
previous plot by including a large red dot showing RIC airport.

```{r, question-06}

```

### Planes

Take the `flights` table and join to the `planes` table using the key `tailnum`.
Look at the resulting data, in particular the name of the first column in the
output, comparing it to the name in the first column of the original `flights`
table.

```{r, question-07}

```

Both `flights` and `planes` have a column called `year`, but they mean different
things. On the first table it is the year of the flight and on second table it
is the year the plane was built. Repeat the last question but add the option
`suffix = c("", "_plane")` to the join function. Look at the new column names
and see how this solved the problem.

```{r, question-08}

```

Using the join code you had above, create a bar plot showing the number of 
flights departing from RIC based on the model year of the plane. Put the years
on the x-axis and DO NOT order by frequency (we want the years in their temporal
order). See any patterns?

```{r, question-09}

```

### Weather

In the code below, join together the `flight` and `weather` tables. Note that
this will require a large number of features to properly define the join.

```{r, question-10}

```

The function `cut` takes two arguments, a numeric feature and an integer number
of buckets. It converts a number value into a set of ordered categories by 
bucketing the numeric values into equally spaced bins. In the next question,
join the `flights` and `weather` tables together, and create a new variable
that cuts the `wind_gust` feature into 10 buckets. Take a moment to look at 
and understand the output.

```{r, question-11}

```

Starting with the code you had above, group the data but the wind gust buckets,
compute the average delay of flights within each category, and compute the 
number of flights in each bucket. You will need to remove missing values in the
`mean` function. Produce a scatter plot that shows the average delay on the
x-axis, the wind category on the y-axis, and use the size of the points to
indicate the number of flights.

```{r, question-12}

```

Does there appear to be a relationship between high wind speeds and departure
delays?

### Big Planes

To finish, let's see how we can make use of a filter join. Create a table in
the code below called `big_planes` that only contains the rows of `planes` with
more than 200 seats.

```{r, question-13}

```

Repeat the code you had for question 4, but use a filter join to only include
flights that have greater than 200 seats. 

```{r, question-14}

```

Where are all of the big planes going that depart from RIC?
