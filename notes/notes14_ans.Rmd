## Homework Answers

For 1, the actual values for the first two columns of the `tidy` function is
given by the following (you don't need to have the exact values; I would say
from the plot the intercept is a bit larger than 70 and the slope is around
3 / 10000):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tidy(model)[,c(1, 2)]
```

For 2, here is the actual output of the augmented model:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
augment(model, newdata = hans_subset) |> select(country, gdp, life_exp, .fitted, .resid)
```

And the smallest and largest absolute residuals are given by:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
augment(model, newdata = hans_subset) |> 
  arrange(abs(.resid)) |>
  summarize(smallest = first(country), biggest = last(country))
```

It's hard to tell on the plot though, and you may have guessed El Salvidor
and/or Trinidad and Tobago, respectively.
