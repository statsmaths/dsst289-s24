### Introduction

My goal for this course is to give an overview of the diverse range of 
areas and subtasks that fall under the interdisciplinary field of data
science. While much of our time is focused on technical details underlying
exploratory analysis, in this second unit of the course we will also integrate
other aspects that are important to consider when working with data. If you 
are interested in exploring these further, there are many other UR courses
that further expand on these questions, such as the inferential modeling
covered in DSST189 and predictive modeling in DSST389. The latter course also
spends much more time focused on the presentation and distribution of data.

Another important part of data science is understanding the bigger
picture of how to determine a research question in the first place and
what to do with the result of an analysis once is has taken place. Many
of these details are domain specific and you'll probably learn more about
them in the methods classes offered such as digital humanities, econometrics,
and quantitative psychology. In addition to these domain-specific elements,
there are also larger questions about data ethics, data justice, and the
role of data in our larger society that should be a part of any data science
work we partake in. These issues are studied at length in the course RHCS345
(part of the Data Science minor). Here, I want to spend some time discussing
how these larger questions should influence the kinds of work we perform in
DSST289.

My notes for today are synthesis of two important pieces or scholarship
which establish, respectively, the concepts of "Data Feminism" and "Data Sheets".
Both are freely available online:

- [D'Ignazio, C., & Klein, L. F. (2020). *Data Feminism*. MIT press.](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/)
- [Gebru, T., Morgenstern, J., Vecchione, B., Vaughan, J. W., Wallach, H., III, H. D., & Crawford, K. (2021). "Datasheets for Datasets." Communications of the ACM, 64(12), 86-92.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf)

You do not need to read the original book and article for this class (though
both are well worth a read when you can find the time). For the purpose of
this semester, we can rely on the notes I have prepared below. 


# Data Feminism

### Introduction

The concept of Data Feminism was introduced in a recently published book with
the same name by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein. They describe the idea
as follows:

> A way of thinking about data, both their uses and their limits, that is
> informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional
> feminist thought. The starting point for data feminism is something that goes
> mostly unacknowledged in data science: power is not distributed equally in the
> world.

The book is filled with thought-provoking examples and hundreds of citations to
scholarship across many fields. While very clear and well-written, I find it be
a difficult text to read if you are not already somewhat familiar with the basic
principals of intersectional feminist thought that the authors are drawing on.
Even more difficult is the practice of taking the concepts in the text and
turning them into actionable things that we can put into our own data science
practice. My goal in the notes here is to try to summarize their ideas and
turn them into concepts we can draw on in our work throughout the rest of the
semester.

The book defines a set of seven principles. I have grouped these into the three
larger categories that are described below.

### I. Use data to create more just, equitable, and livable futures

If you have no prior background in intersectional feminist thought, you mighy
presume that it has something to do with the study of gender and sex- or 
gender-based inequalities. And, it is the case that these questions are a core
part of the field. At the same time, D'Ignazio and Klein's use of the term
feminism is intended to be even broader, which they explain as follows:

> [W]e employ the term feminism as a shorthand for the diverse and wide-ranging
> projects that name and challenge sexism and other forces of oppression, as
> well as those which seek to create more just, equitable, and livable futures.

As such, the principles are not so much a question specifically about gender but
rather concerns about power. What structures create and reinforce power? How is
power being used? How can we challenge unequal power and work toward reflixive
and equitable systems of justice?

The connection to our work comes from the fact that data is an ever-increasing
structure of power in our society. Data affects our lives in many ways, from
major life events such as college admissions and hiring practices, to day-to-day
occurances such as the availability, pricing, and marketing of practically 
every good and service that we spend money on. Insurance prices, home mortgage
rates, and airline prices have long used complex algorithms built on large 
datasets; these practices are now becoming the norm across almost every industry.

While data has become an important source of power, it is not a source of 
power equally available to everyone. A lot of data is expensive to produce and
store and therefore is only available to large, rich institutions such as 
certain government agencies, large companies, and research universities. Some
forms of data, likewise, cannot be collected equally by everyone due to legal
and legistical barriers. As an important example in our current moment, Google
became what it is today by building a better search engine by crawling across
the internet to analyze to content of individual websites. Today, it would be
impossible for another company to start a competing service because of 
barries Google has put up to re-collecting that kind of data. 

Even when it possible for everyone to collect data, not all entities have the
same level of power that they can wield with their datasets. Datasets created
and published by institutions such as the United Nations instantly gain a
level of credibility that is difficult or impossible for other groups to 
establish for their own datasets. Similarly, when corporations and governments
build algorithms with their own curated datasets, those data gain a special
level of power that can rarely be questioned or easily challenged.

So how can this principal lead us to better science practices? There is no
simple answer to this question and it is something that we will return to 
throughout the rest of the semester. Two things we can try to do, however,
are to identify ways that the data and analysis that we are using and creating
could be used as a form of power while also doing our best to avoid creating 
and reinforcing unequal power structures. As an alternative, we should
privilege projects, data sets, and analyses that are guided by principles
that challenge these existing structures while working towards a more equal
society. 

### II. Recognize that data is never neutral or objective

Our second summarized principle of Data Feminism is the concept that data is
never neutral of objective. Depending our academic background, this concept
may range from either surprising or clich√©. Let's try to break this idea down a
bit to see how it can lead us to better data scientists.

Where the first principle focused on the unequal power structures created by
the use of data, here we want to focus on the more specific (but closely
related) role of the data itself. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of
the ways that we can understand data as never being neutral of objective:

1. We can never collect an infinite amount of data; there is always a bias
due to our selective decisions about what data to collect and store.
2. Making certain kinds of data available, either freely or for a fee, can
be a powerful action on its own. If the data contains personal or private
information, releasing or selling the data can have potential negative 
effects on the individuals involved. Likewise, withholding important medical
research data to promote one's own career can have negative effects on 
patients suffering from the disease being studied. Determining what to
distribute is always a political choice that never has a perfect or neutral
answer.
3. Determining how to record and store data also involves choices that 
never have an entirely neutral choice. For example, should we record the 
gender of people on a binary scale? Provide an Other category? Ask everyone
to fill in an open-ended box? The latter might sound like the "best" option.
However, as a result in the data might become so messy it prevents using it
study questions related to gender and sexuality.
4. The unit of analysis, a concept we constantly return to in this class,
is another choice that influences a datatset without a neutral or objective
choice available. If we, for example, aggregate a dataset about individuals
to the level of cities certain questions become inaccessible from the
resulting dataset. If we release data at a very fine level of granularity,
we run the risk of release sensitive data into the world or preventing our
study from being reproducible. 

Let's take one example that helps illustrate some of these points from
two different angles. In 2018, a team from MIT led by Joy Buolamwini 
produced a dataset of photographs from 1270 unique individuals from a
diverse set of skin types and racial backgrounds. The team applied
face detection and recognition algorithms from a variety of open-source
and commercial providers and demonstrated that existing algorithms 
performed significantly worse when applied to this set than when used
to label a collection of individuals they perceived to be White. The
implication was that the dataset used to train these algorithms
consisted of overwhelmingly White faces and individuals living in the
United States and Europe.

The example from Joy Buolamwini is a great example of the first principle
in action. A data scientist collected and analyzed data to identify and
challenge a problematic power structure. Likewise, from her work it is not
too difficulty to see that the previously existing datasets for face
detection had some problematic biases and were far from neutral or
objective. At the same time, what about Buolamwini's dataset? It is 
not entirely neutral or objective either. It focuses primarily on the
Black/White binary, with no representation of faces from Asian or 
Indigenous communities. Also, the research group elected not to make their
dataset freely available. On one hand this helps maintain it as a set that 
can check biases in other algorithms and avoids potentially problematic issues
of distributing human images, such as the potential tokenization of the 
individuals involved in the study. On the other hand, holding back the data
prevents others from using it to do the kind of diversification that their
paper called for. Clearly there is no easy answer and I would not say that
either option is truly neural or objective.

So how can we put this principle into action in our data science practice? 
Because there is no way to make our data and analysis neutral or objective, it
is important for us to reflect and document all of the choices we make in 
constructing and analyzing data. These choices should be done by taking into
account the goals of our work, following field-specific best practice
guidelines, the weighing the pros and cons of different communities that might
be affected by our actions. Secondly, because no dataset of method will capture
all perspectives, we should use a variety of approaches when addressing 
our research questions. Options include using data from different sources, 
analyzing data collected in different ways, and integrating insights from
quantitative and qualitative analyses to gain a broader set of perspectives.

### III. Make labor visible

The final principle of Data Feminism highlighted by D'Ignazio and Klein 
involves the importance of recognizing and that good data science involves the 
work and collaboration of a large number of people. As they concisely explain:

> When designing data products from a feminist perspective, we must similarly
> aspire to show the work involved in the entire lifecycle of the project. This
> remains true even as it can be difficult to name each individual involved or
> when the work may be collective in nature and not able to be attributed to a
> single source.

Some diverse types of labor involved in data science work include participants
who partake in human-based research studies, librarians and archivists who 
curate and catalog vast collections of human knowledge, and students who 
participate in the collection and analysis of large datasets. In
*Data Feminism*, the authors interrogate an even larger set of possible roles
involves in working with data and explore several particularly difficult
examples of crediting work and possible solutions.

How do we integrate this into our work? The short answer is that we should 
try to surface all of the people that contribute to our work as data scientists.
In terms of the more specific way that we should do this, we turn to the final
section of these notes.

# Datasheets for Datasets

Many, though certainly not all, of the actionable ideas from Data Feminism
involve doing a better job of reflecting and documenting the data science
process. To consider a way of doing this, let's turn to the second reference 
mentioned above. The goal of the "Datasheets for Datasets" article can be 
summarized from the following quote:

> Despite the importance of data to machine learning, there is currently no
> standardized process for documenting machine learning datasets. To address
> this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets... [W]e propose that every
> dataset be accompanied with a datasheet that documents its motivation,
> composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on. Datasheets for
> datasets have the potential to increase transparency and accountability within
> the machine learning community, mitigate unwanted societal biases in machine
> learning models, facilitate greater reproducibility of machine learning
> results, and help researchers and practitioners to select more appropriate
> datasets for their chosen tasks.

The rest of the article describes the kinds of elements the authors suggest 
should be included in a datasheet. Some of these are very technical and only
applicable to the sub-field of machine learning. The core ideas, though, can
be adapted to provide a framework for any dataset. 

I have adapted and simplified the framework from "Datasheets for Datasets" to
better align with the Data Feminism principles above. Here are the eight
sections that I propose should be a part of our concept of a Feminist Datasheet:

1. **Metadata**: A short section providing a clear title for the dataset, a
publication date, a version number (if applicable), a standard format for
citing the dataset, and (if possible) contact information for more information.
2. **Motivation**: Clearly articulate their reasons for creating the dataset and
explain how the creation of the dataset was funded. Implict in this section 
should be a reflection of how these motivations align with the value systems of
the people and organizations involved with its creation.
3. **Composition**: This is essentially the data dictionary that we discussed 
in the previous set of notes. Should include a short summary describing each
table, its unit of observation, and the meaning behind every feature included
in each table.
4. **Narrative**: This section should include a description of how the data
were collected and a reflection on all of the design choices that went into the
data creation process. This would include what features to include, how to 
code/measure them, and how to select the specific observations included in the
dataset. 
5. **Distribution**: A section describing how the data are distributed, which
should include the format of the data, the licence it is being distributed
under, and where (if possible) the data can be accessed. The section should 
also include information about any ways that the data have been changed before
being published, such as removing personal identifying information.
6. **Attributions**: An as complete as possible description of all the people
involved in the creation and conceptualization of the dataset. 
7. **References**: A representative list of references to other resources and
datasets with similar research motivations. This helps avoid the problems of
putting too much focus on a single source or single way of knowing.
8. **Notes**: An optional section describing any additional notes not covered
above. Particularly useful to describe how a dynamic dataset changes over time.

We will talk more in class about these concepts and how they might be put into
action with a specific dataset. This will become the basis for the class final
projects.

## Homework Questions

This is a long reading. Rather than a specific piece of homework, make sure that
you really read the whole thing at a good level of detail. These concepts will
permeate our work throughout the rest of the semester.
