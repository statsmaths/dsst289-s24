This week, we are going to do some review of the material we have already
covered in class as well as practice applying our techniques to some new
datasets. In lieu of a specific homework task, please review the solutions
to notebooks 7-10 and any of the related notes that you found difficult.

If you want to deepen your understanding of course material, I suggest
reading the solutions, taking a break, and then trying to answer the
questions from scratch with a clean RMarkdown file. Try to answer the 
questions without looking at the solutions.
